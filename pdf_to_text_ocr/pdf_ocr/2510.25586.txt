Abstract

Ammonia is a zero-carbon fuel that has been receiving increasing atten-
tion for power generation and even transportation. Compared to hydrogen,
ammonia’s volumetric energy density is higher, is not as explosive, and has
well established transport and storage technologies. However, ammonia has
poor flammability and flame stability characteristics and more reactive ni-
trogen emissions (nitrogen oxides, nitrous oxide) than hydrocarbon fuels, at
least with traditional combustion processes. Partially cracking ammonia ad-
dresses its flammability and stability issues, through on-board catalysts or
autothermal crackers, into a mixture of ammonia, hydrogen, and nitrogen.
However, reactive nitrogen emissions remain a challenge, and mechanisms
of their emissions are fundamentally different in ammonia and hydrocarbon
combustion. While rich-quench-lean ammonia combustion strategies have
shown promise, the largest contributions to reactive nitrogen emissions are
the unrelaxed emissions in the fuel-rich first stage due to overshoot of ther-

modynamic equilibrium within the reaction zone of premixed flames coupled

Preprint submitted to Combustion and Flame
with finite residence times available for relaxation to equilibrium. This work
introduces a rush-to-equilibrium concept for partially cracked ammonia com-
bustion, which aims to reduce the unrelaxed reactive nitrogen emissions in
finite residence times by accelerating the approach to equilibrium. In the con-
cept, a flow particle is subjected to a decaying mixing rate as it transits the
premixed flame. This plays an important role in mitigating the mixing effects
that prevents the flow particle approach to equilibrium, and promoting the
chemistry effects to push the particle toward equilibrium, all while consider-
ing residence times typical of gas turbines. Evaluated with a state-of-the-art
combustion model at gas turbine conditions, the concept shows the potential
for a reduction in reactive nitrogen emissions by an order of magnitude at
even modest mixing rate decay rates. It is also shown that the concept works
irrespective of cracking extent, pressure, temperature, etc. A brief discussion
of possible practical implementation reveals reasonable geometric and flow
parameters characteristic of modern gas turbine combustors.
Novelty and Significance Statement

A novel rush-to-equilibrium combustion concept is proposed with the aim
of reducing reactive nitrogen emissions, which include nitrogen oxides and
nitrous oxide, from partially cracked ammonia combustion at gas turbine
conditions. Reactive nitrogen emissions are elevated in partially cracked
ammonia combustion systems because insufficient residence time is available
to reach thermodynamic equilibrium. A concept is proposed to address this
issue, leveraging decaying mixing rates, without modifying typical gas turbine
residence times by accelerating the approach to thermodynamic equilibrium.

The new concept is demonstrated of being capable of significantly reducing
reactive nitrogen emissions (by a factor of an order of magnitude). Finally,
implementation of the new concept is showed to be practically feasible.

1. Introduction

Decarbonizing combustion energy conversion has become a critical en-
deavor to combat climate change, and zero-carbon fuels will play a vital role
in achieving net-zero carbon emissions in the global economy as quickly as
possible. While hydrogen has received the most attention as a future zero-
carbon fuel, ammonia is garnering increasing attention due to its ease of
transport compared to hydrogen and well established infrastructure due to
its use in agriculture [I}4]. However, challenges arise in burning ammonia
due to its low flammability, its poor flame stability, and its emission of re-
active nitrogen species, including nitrogen oxides (NO,,) and nitrous oxides
(N20) [2]. Improvements to the combustibility of ammonia can be addressed
by partially cracking ammonia, achieved through on-board catalysts or au-

tothermal crackers [5], resulting in a mixture of ammonia, hydrogen, and
nitrogen (AHN), which can be tailored to have similar combustion proper-
ties to methane [6] [7]. The grand challenge then is to develop ammonia
combustion processes with low reactive nitrogen emissions, which is critical
to its overall environmental benefit or potential harm [8].

Recent work in the literature suggest several strategies have been investi-
gated to improve ammonia combustion, namely swirl stabilized combustion
[9HI3], moderate or intense low oxygen dilution (MILD) combustion [I4}
(17, and staged combustion approach in a rich-quench-lean (RQL) configu-

ration [18}25]. The latter suggests that burning ammonia using the RQL

configuration can mitigate reactive nitrogen emissions [26]. Indeed, fuel-lean
ammonia combustion produces very high nitrogen oxide emissions compared
to fuel-rich ammonia combustion [2] [18]. Therefore, a fuel-rich first stage
burns much of the ammonia without excessive nitrogen oxide emissions, and
a fuel-lean second stage burns the resulting hydrogen and any remaining am-
monia. Considered differently, the first stage essentially cracks the ammonia
to minimize the ammonia burned in the second stage. Ammonia combus-
tion strategies have been developed based on hydrocarbon-fueled RQL con-
cepts 27129] with quite low reactive nitrogen emissions [19] [30]. Another
work [16] also suggests that MILD combustion approach also leads to low
emissions that are comparable to the RQL configuration [4] [[5}H17].

While ammonia combustion systems based on hydrocarbon-fueled system
concepts have been somewhat successful in achieving relatively low reactive
nitrogen emissions, ammonia and hydrocarbons have different chemical path-
ways to reactive nitrogen emissions, which fundamentally changes their na-

ture. Recent studies indicate that burning ammonia in RQL gas
turbine, with residence times typical of hydrocarbon gas turbines, results in
significantly higher NO, emissions compared to thermodynamic equilibrium.
This increase is attributed to the “unrelaxed” component of NO, emissions
originating from the first stage, albeit still lower that a lean premixed single-
stage combustor running on ammonia. These unrelaxed emissions result
from the overshoot of reactive nitrogen emissions within the reaction zone
of ammonia flames, well above their thermodynamic equilibrium values, and
the excessive time required for these emissions to relax toward thermody-
namic equilibrium. Unfortunately, practical constraints, such as the size and
cost of the gas turbine, limit the residence time in the combustion cham-
ber. Of course, with hydrocarbon fuels, long residence times are undesirable
anyway since reactive nitrogen emissions rapidly increases as equilibrium is
approached.

This work introduces a novel concept for ammonia (more generally, AHN)
combustion, termed ‘rush-to-equilibrium’, aiming to minimize unrelaxed re-
active emissions without increasing residence times. The rush-to-equilibrium
concept is analyzed with a premixed manifold combustion model [83], which
is first introduced. Next, using the manifold model, characteristics of AHN
combustion and methane combustion are compared, with specific emphasis
on the interplay between mixing and chemistry in premixed flames, to moti-
vate the rush-to-equilibrium concept. Then, the rush-to-equilibrium concept
is introduced, leveraging a decaying mixing rate, and an in-depth analy-
sis is undertaken to demonstrate the degree of reactive nitrogen emissions
reduction that can be achieved. Finally, the practical feasibility and im-

plementation of the rush-to-equilibrium combustion concept is then briefly
discussed.

2. Manifold model for premixed combustion

Combustion is governed by a high-dimensional thermochemical state in-
cluding the temperature 7’ and species mass fractions Y,;, with k = 1,..., Ns;
and N, the number of species in the gas mixture. The dimensionality can be
reduced by projecting the thermochemical state onto a reduced-order man-
ifold [34]. For premixed combustion, the thermochemical state is projected
onto a one-dimensional manifold in the progress variable A, which is zero in
the unburned gases and unity at thermodynamic equilibrium.

Starting from the governing equations for the species mass fraction (and
temperature), following the notation of Mueller [83], the one-dimensional
equilibrium manifold equations in progress variable for the species mass frac-
tions are given by

OY; ring = EXAM OY,
aA 2 OR

where mm, and mm, are the progress variable and species mass fraction source
terms, respectively, p is the density, and y~, = 2DVA- VA is the progress
variable dissipation rate, that is, the mixing rate, where D is the thermal

diffusivity. The progress variable A is then defined as

=> (2)
Yr eq Yr u

where the subscripts u and eq correspond to the unburned and equilibrium

mixture. The subscript R corresponds to the reference mass fraction Yr =

rer Ye, comprised of a weighted linear combination of product mass
fractions. The corresponding progress variable source term is then defined

as

. l .
ma = Ov,/on® ‘ (3)
The reference species for AHN is H2O and weight ag = 1; for methane, the
reference species are COg, CO, H20, and Hg, with weights ager = 1, 1, 1,
and 10, respectively. In Eq. |l} the basic balance of the premixed manifold
equations is the progress variable as the “arrow-of-time” on the left-hand-side
balance by mixing and chemistry effects on the right-hand-side.
Unstretched premixed flames can be analyzed to understand the relative
roles of chemistry and mixing in the manifold equations. To model unstretch
premixed flames in progress variable space, an additional transport equation
for the gradient of the progress variable gy = VA can be solved with the
equilibrium manifold equations, similar to work of Scholtissek et al. [35]. In

this work, the equation is adapted to the progress variable A [83] as

Z Ogn Oo? f Oma
Tray = Iroqz(PD9a) + 9x (4)

where the left-hand-side term corresponds to convective effects (A-drift), and
the right-hand-side terms correspond to diffusive and chemical effects [85].
The manifold solution for unstretched flames will be useful to show later how
the emissions behave in methane and (partially cracked) ammonia combus-
tion at different compositions. Mixing effects in turbulent combustion lead
to stretched flame configurations, and Eq. [4] will no longer be representative
of such cases. However, results are not sensitive to these profiles, and the

ga transport equation is omitted, which makes computations more efficient
for assessing the rush-to-equilibrium concept. To close the manifold equa-
tions for stretched premixed flames, the dependence of the progress variable

dissipation rate on progress variable takes a presumed form [33] [36]:

xaa(Z, A) = xiX\ exp E (exte™ (aa =e za) | (5)

x exp [-2 (erfe"(24))"] ;

where y<{ is a reference dissipation rate evaluated at the stoichiometric mix-

ture (Z,,) and reference progress variable A = 0.5, and Z is the mixture
fraction (based on the equivalence ratio of the unburned gas composition).
While the manifold model can generally accommodate differential diffusion
[33] [37], for convenience, a unity effective Lewis number assumption is made
that does not impact the results presented subsequently in the manuscript.

The above manifold equations from Eq. |] are an “equilibrium” manifold
formulation [83] in which the local flame structure in progress variable instan-
taneously equilibrates to the instantaneous progress variable dissipation rate.
As discussed below, the rush-to-equilibrium concept relies on an unsteady
mixing rate, that is, an unsteady progress variable dissipation rate y'<f (t),
so, to ensure any flow history effects are considered, a “non-equilibrium”
manifold formulation [33] is also considered that includes an additional un-

steady history term on the left-hand-side:

OY, | OYe . pxan O?Y;,

Pa toa =o ane tT (6)

where, without loss of generality, this history term is indicated with a partial

derivative in physical time (cf. Ref. [33]).
The corresponding progress variable transport equation is written as

On On (a) On .

Pay * PMs Ox; Ox; (oo) et (7)
where u,; correspond to the flow velocity. Given a time-varying mixing rate
xref (t), rather than look at the global flame structure in progress variable
space at a particular time, a Lagrangian analysis will follow a reacting flow
element that samples a specific temporal trajectory of progress variable. The
progress variable of the reacting flow element A* (¢) (distinct from progress
variable space denoted by the simple A) is obtained by reorganizing the
progress variable transport equation (Eq. |7) in a Lagrangian perspective:
pn i a (eo) + Ta, (8)

where d/dt = 0/0t + u,0/0x; is the Lagrangian derivative. To solve this

equation with the non-equilibrium manifold equations, the diffusion term on
the right-hand-side can be recast in progress variable space such that the

evolution of A can be determined from the global flame structure:

0 (OM) _ [1 Apxan , Xan OD) |*

In the right-hand-side of Eq.|10} [-]
pled from the solutions to Eq. [6] Also, A* is used to sample the global flame
structure as they both vary with Lagrangian time together. In other words,

the evolution of A* is solved together with the “non-equlibrium” manifold
equations in Eq. GG to provide a temporal history of a fluid element evolving
through a premixed flame subjected to an unsteady mixing rate.

The model is implemented in the PDRs solver [83] [38]. Chemical kinetics
are modeled using the mechanism from Gotama et al. (31 species and
165 reactions) for AHN combustion and GRI-Mech 3.0 [40] (53 species and
325 reactions) for methane combustion. The A space is discretized onto a 256
points non-uniform grid for the global flame structure. For a flame element,

the progress variable step dA* is determined by solving Eq.

3. Characteristics of reactive nitrogen emissions

The partially cracking of ammonia (NH3) is obtained by following the

reaction:
so the final fuel mixture is
3a Qa

where a indicates the NH3 cracking or dissociation percentage. For a = 60%,
the laminar flame speed of AHN is similar to methane [6} [7]. Simulations
are carried out at gas turbine conditions, with inlet temperature T,, = 750K,
pressure p = 10bar, equivalence ratios in the range ¢ € [0, 2], and three AHN

cracking percentages a = 40%, 60%, and 80%.

to those of methane (red line) at very fuel-lean mixtures. Temperature differ-
ences are observed closer to stoichiometric mixture and for fuel-rich mixtures
since the heats of combustion are different for the various fuels.

NO mass fractions are plotted in Fig. |2| for both AHN (blue lines) and
methane (red line) at thermodynamic equilibrium. Yyo emissions are maxi-
mized at ¢ © 0.75, and AHN shows comparable NO emissions to methane,
more or less consistent with the differences in temperature in Fig.[I] Similar

trends and conclusions can be observed for N2O, shown in Fig.

| although,
counter-intuitively, methane actually has higher emissions than AHN.
These results are seemingly contrary to practice. For methane, reactive
nitrogen emissions are lowest in practice for overall fuel-lean systems. For
AHN, the equilibrium emissions are not any worse than hydrocarbons. The

simple fact of the matter is that thermodynamics alone cannot be used to

explain reactive nitrogen emissions in practical systems, for thermodynamic
equilibrium is never reached with finite residence time. Since equilibrium
considerations alone cannot explain emissions, the approach to equilibrium
must be fundamentally different between AHN combustion and methane
combustion that leads to their different emissions characteristics (higher than
equilibrium for AHN and lower than equilibrium for methane) and practical
combustion strategies. While this discussion is somewhat obvious, empha-
sizing the fundamentally different kinetic features of these fuels is important

to motivate fundamentally different combustion processes.

particle A* is tracked starting at A = 0 for a finite residence time of 10 ms,
typical of gas turbine residence times.

Figures [4] and [5|show the final temperature and NO mass fraction versus
equivalence ratio at 10 ms. Results show the same trends as observed in
Fig. [I] which explains that such flame features are associated to relatively
short time scales. However, NO mass fraction differs to what is observed in
Fig. |2| as its chemical reaction progress is slower than flame time scales. NO
production in CHy-air flame is lower than in the AHN-air flames, especially
for fuel-lean conditions (¢ < 0.9). For fuel-rich flames, AHN-air flames are
comparable to CHy-air flames. More telling, NO emissions in the CHy-air
flame are lower than equilibrium, while, for the AHN-air flames, they are
higher than equilibrium. In general, for AHN-air flames, longer residence
times will lead to a decrease in NO mass fraction, as they approach to equi-
librium, and for CHy-air flames the opposite. Similar behavior happens with

N2O emissions (not shown), which is negligible in CH,-air flames with respect

To understand the approach to equilibrium and the behavior of reactive
nitrogen emissions at finite residence times, the (equilibrium) manifold solu-
tions for AHN- and CHy-air unstretched flames are further analyzed. Typical
gas turbine inlet mixtures are chosen: ¢ = 0.45 for CHy-air and ¢ = 1.4 (first
stage) for AHN-air at three cracking extents, where T, and p are kept the
same as before. The NO mass fraction profile is plotted in Fig. [6] The Yyo
profile in the CH,y-air flame shows low emissions up to A & 0.9 and abruptly
increases as the Ny bond breaks in the hot burned gases. In the AHN-air
combustion, Yyo forms much earlier in the flames, peaking within the intense
reaction zone and then “relaxing” toward equilibrium (0.9 < A < 1). The
maximum NO mass fraction is a strong function of the cracking percent-
age, increasing with the cracking percentage for the values shown here (at

higher cracking yet, the peak reactive nitrogen mass fractions will decrease

The approach to equilibrium then dictates the practical combustion strate-
gies. For methane-air combustion, not too long residence times are desirable
since reactive nitrogen emissions form only very close to equilibrium. On the
other hand, for AHN-air combustion, long residence times are desirable to
get as close to thermodynamic equilibrium as possible and minimize “unre-
laxed” emissions. However, longer residence times incur additional capital
costs and would also increase heat losses so would not necessarily be desir-
able. Therefore, a combustion process that could accelerate the relaxation
to equilibrium without increasing residence time would be highly desirable

for minimizing reactive nitrogen emissions in AHN combustion.

4. Rush-to-equilibrium concept

As discussed in the previous section, accelerating the approach to equilib-
rium is critical to minimizing reactive nitrogen emissions in AHN combustion.
To develop such a combustion strategy, the fundamental balance in premixed
combustion must be analyzed. Terms on the right-hand side of the progress
variable transport equation of Eq. [8]govern the increase in the progress vari-
able of a reacting flow particle and are shown in Fig. [7] for AHN combustion
at the same conditions considered previously for different values of the mix-
ing rate x'¢{ and indicate the forcing on the progress variable. For the mixing
term (left), the term is positive at low progress variable and negative at high
progress variable. The positive values at low progress variable are respon-

sible for transport from the reaction zone through the preheat zone. Since

chemistry is not present at this stage, passive transport through the preheat

zone occurs. Increasing the reference dissipation rate significantly increases
mixing effects in the flame. The chemical term (center) is exclusively positive
and largest at higher progress variables in the reaction zone. The balance of
this competition is shown in the total right-hand-side (right). For all mixing
rates, the (negative) mixing at high progress variable inhibits the chemistry’s
progress, making the net progress rate is lower than chemistry, making the
approach to equilibrium “slower”. In fact, at the highest mixing rates, the
total term can become negative, resulting in a “frozen” state at the zero
crossing of the total (A 0.74 for the highest dissipation rate in the plots),
far from equilibrium, and with very high unrelaxed NO, emissions (although
such a flame would never be practically realized for obvious reasons). These
NO, emissions are shown in Fig. [8] for the three cases. Indeed, as the resi-
dence time is increased, the equilibrium conditions will be reached except for

the fast mixing case (dotted line), where a mass fraction higher than 2 x 1073

is reached at the “frozen” state.

This fundamental balance then motivates a novel rush-to-equilibrium
combustion concept to get as close to equilibrium as fast as possible. As
a reacting flow particle moves through the flame, at low progress variable,
fast mixing rates are desirable, promoting the increase in progress variable,
but, at high progress variable, slow mixing rates are desirable, avoiding sup-
pression of chemistry’s tendency to increase the progress variable. Therefore,
as a reacting flow particle travels through the flame, a temporally decaying
(in a Lagrangian sense) mixing rate would be desirable. For proof-of-concept,
the following temporally evolving mixing rate is considered:

xh) = an, (13)
: L+ayrit’
where an initial reference dissipation rate y%{(0) = y{, and a decay rate

a are prescribed. This decaying mixing rate will promote a faster approach

18
to equilibrium, so a fixed residence time of 10 ms, typical of gas turbine

combustors, will be considered.

5. Evaluation of the rush-to-equilibrium concept

In Section B} it was observed that reactive nitrogen emissions are higher
at high cracking percentages, because the reacting mixtures have higher final
temperatures (see Figs.[IJand|4) due to Hg reactivity. To provide a fairer com-
parison with cracking percentages, the evaluation of the rush-to-equilibrium
concept is made by considering the equilibrium temperature (roughly) the
same for all mixtures, this is, by keeping enthalpy the same for all mixtures.
Therefore, the initial temperature for the mixtures are chosen such that the
enthalpy of the mixture is equal to that of the case with a = 40%, p = 10bar,
and ¢ = 1.4.

Figure [9] shows the results of the temporal evolution of the progress vari-
able of the reacting flow particle A* for initial mixing rate y{, = 10° s~t,
multiple cracking extents, and different decay rates. As expected, the decay-
ing mixing rate allows the fluid element to move from the initial unburned
mixture to the reacting stage to (near) equilibrium conditions. For this rel-
atively fast initial mixing rate, a constant dissipation rate (a = 0) leads
to a “frozen” condition, as discussed above. Note that the chemical source
terms increase with cracking extent, so the “frozen” condition is closer to
equilibrium with increasing cracking extent. As the decay rate increases,
for all cracking extents, the time needed to reach near equilibrium condition
decreases, and the thermochemical state is nearly to thermodynamic equi-

librium with the same fixed residence time. The transit time through the

here, for slower initial mixing rates, if the decay rate is too fast, transport
will not be strong enough to provide the initial increase in the progress vari-
able, and the flow particle will be stuck at a very low progress variable state
since the homogeneous ignition delay time for this mixture is very long.

A deeper insight on how the decay rate affects the global flame structure
is shown in Fig. by analyzing the temporal evolution of the progress
variable terms from Eq. [8|for the flame with ¢ = 1.4 and cracking percentage
a = 60%, where a varies from 0 (no decay) to 100 (unrealistic excessive
decay). Similar conclusions can be obtained with other cracking percentages.

barely affected, giving positive balance in the total progress (right column)
for rather fast decays compared to slow to no decay cases. A fast decay affect
the initial progress significantly: for a very fast decay (a = 100), the progress
of A* is about 11 times smaller than the moderate decay (a = 1) and about 13
times smaller with respect to no decay (a = 0), meaning initial stage for fast
decays versus almost midway stages for slower decays. Nevertheless, the case
with no decay reached the “frozen” state due to zero balance between mixing
and chemistry as can be observed in the following instants. At t = 10~‘s,
the decaying mixing affects chemistry at a smaller proportion compared to
mixing rate for moderate to fast decay, where only a half reduction of the
chemistry term is observed. The total progress becomes more positive for
decaying mixing. The reactive element is still located in the first half of
the progress variable domain for very fast decay compared to other cases
at about 3.3 times smaller with respect to moderate decay (a = 1) and 2.5
times smaller compared to no decay (a = 0). This is followed by the abrupt
progress at fast decay, where at t = 1 ms, the reactive element in decaying
cases is at 95% reaction progress or more. Total progress profiles are positive

for decaying cases, with slow mixing at the final stage and almost unaffected

chemistry effects with respect to the previous state. A slight decrease of the

combined effects are observed at t = 10 ms, where the reactive particle is at
near equilibrium conditions for all decaying mixing scenarios.
To quantify the effects of cracking extent, the reactive element trajectory

is analyzed in progress variable space from a Lagrangian point of view. Figure

reactive element A* using the rush-to-equilibrium concept and evaluated for

23
different decay rates a and cracking percentages a and fixed initial mixing
rate x4, = 10°s~!. The decaying mixing rate effectively allows for a positive
progress rate from the beginning to the end of the reacting element trajectory
(bottom row), which decomposes into a high positive mixing term in the first
half (top row) and a chemically-driven second half (middle row) with low
negative mixing (top row). Decay rates have significant effects in the first
half of the mixing rate profiles (top row). As observed in Fig. chemistry is
much less affected by the decaying rate compared to mixing, with almost one
half difference between very fast decay and no decay cases. The total progress
rate increases in the second half as the the reactivity of the mixture increases
with cracking much more compared to negative mixing. The balance between
mixing and chemistry elucidates that moderate to high decaying rates are
preferred to reach near equilibrium conditions faster in agreement with the
observations in Fig. 9

The progress variables of the reacting flow element A* at the fixed 10
ms residence time as a function of the decay rate are shown in Fig. and
support the discussion above. Three initial reference dissipation rates are
considered, and only cases reaching close to thermodynamic equilibrium by
t = 10 ms are included. Results with zero decay (transparent thin lines) and
the thermodynamic equilibrium condition (black line) are also included. In

all cases, a decaying mixing rates promotes a closer approach to equilibrium

compared to the constant mixing rate. As y%, increases, the fluid element
benefits more from faster mixing decay rates. As the cracking percentage

increases, equilibrium is approached more slowly towards the end of the sim-

ulation for slow decays, which is consistent with Figs. [9] but still closer

and N2O emissions decrease as the reacting flow element more closely ap-
proaches thermodynamic equilibrium. Consistent with the decaying mixing
rates providing a final thermochemical state closer to thermodynamic equi-
librium, decaying mixing rates significantly reduce both reactive nitrogen
emissions through a reduction in the unrelaxed emissions. For slower decay
rates, the reactive nitrogen emissions are more sensitive to the initial mixing
rate, but they are still much lower than the corresponding constant mixing
rates, a factor of two or more for NO and a factor of three or more for N2O at
the smaller cracking percentages. For instance, for moderate initial mixing

decay rate (a = 1), NO emissions are about 7 times lower and N2O about 29
times lower compared to those with constant mixing (a = 0). For fast initial
mixing (x{, = 10°s~!, dotted lines), the emissions with constant mixing are
too high as they do not reach near equilibrium conditions (lines are outside
the plotting window). For the fastest decay rates, at the smaller cracking
percentages, the emissions reach (nearly) their thermodynamic equilibrium
values, almost entirely eliminating the unrelaxed NO emissions, but, while
moderate decay rates are certainly practical (see the next subsection), these
fastest decay rates may not be practical. Finally, for the same initial mixing

rates and decay rates, for the highest cracking percentage, the reduction in

26
the NO emissions is not as strong, with a factor of two or more with de-
creasing initial mixing rates. N»2O is only slightly higher, with a factor of
two or less with increasing initial mixing rates. This may motivate the use
of less cracked ammonia to minimize reactive nitrogen emissions. Overall,
although N2O emissions are about two order of magnitude or more higher
with respect to equilibrium conditions, these reductions are still substantial,
especially for high initial mixing rates. Results considering the same initial
temperature instead of the constant enthalpy are included in the Supple-
mentary Materials. Also, the use of different decaying mixing rate profiles
can significantly improve the reduction of nitrogen emissions. An example
of using exponential decay is shown in the Supplementary Materials, where
reactive nitrogen emissions can reach as low as equilibrium conditions. How-
ever, practical application may not be feasible, which motivates future work
on the optimization of decaying mixing rate profiles to achieve low emissions.

The effects of pressure and initial temperature on reacting nitrogen pro-
duction are now analyzed. In this case, the moderate mixing case yQ, =
10* s-!, p = 10 bar, and T, = 750K is kept as reference case. The sec-
ond case considers lower pressure p = 1 bar and same initial temperature
T, = 750 K. The third case considers lower initial temperature T,, = 450 K
and same pressure. Figures [14] show NO (top) and NjO (bottom) emissions
as a function of the decay rate a, for the three cracking percentages. The
quantities for constant mixing (a = 0, transparent lines) and equilibrium (for
the reference case only, black line) are also included. In general, a decrease
of pressure increases substantially the emissions, reaching over one order of

magnitude difference for both NO and N20, with respect to the reference

case. Trends of emissions with increasing decay rate changes from small to
high cracking percentages, where NO goes from negative to zero slope and
N2O towards more negative slopes. On the other hand, a decrease of ini-
tial temperature improves the reduction of reactive nitrogen, especially for
moderate to high cracking percentages. For low cracking percentages, near
equilibrium conditions are achieved for fast decays only. NO emissions are
reduced by a factor of about two to five times with increasing decays, with

respect to the reference case, which are even lower than the reference case

28
equilibrium values. Although N2O emissions slightly decrease for small and
moderate cracking, a reduction by a factor of four is observed for high crack-
ing and very fast decay. Overall, high pressure and low initial temperature
are convenient for low emissions. This could potentially benefit the upstream
partial cracking processes.

Although it is meant to be used at the fuel-rich mixture stage or front-end
of RQL combustors, the rush-to-equilibrium concept has also been evaluated
for stoichiometric and lean conditions, which are included in the Supplemen-
tary Materials. It is shown that the concept still works in those conditions
but with small to moderate reduction of reactive nitrogen emissions with re-
spect to rich mixtures. It is also shown that the combustion chemistry model

used utilized in simulations has no influence on the results.

6. Practical implementation of the concept

The natural question that arises then is how the rush-to-equilibrium con-
cept could be practically implemented. Assuming that the turbulent mix-
ing rate scales with the turbulent velocity fluctuations that scale with the
local mean velocity, the concept could be practically implemented within
a diffuser-shaped combustion chamber. For a decay rate a = 1 with an
initial dissipation rate y{, = 104 s71,
D; ~ O(0.10 m) [41] 42) and a diffuser angle 6 = 7° [28] would lead to an
outlet diameter D, ~ O(0.3 m) and combustor length L ~ O(0.9m). A

a typical combustor inlet diameter

residence time of 10 ms would result in characteristics velocities of tens of
m/s. These quantities are reasonably consistent with gas turbine combus-

tion chambers. A faster decay rate would require a larger diffuser angle (or

29
a smaller diameter but longer combustor with a faster flow speed) so may
not be practically relevant, but the decay rate a = 1 already provides a
substantial reduction in the reactive nitrogen emissions. The ideal decaying
mixing rate that minimizes reactive nitrogen emissions to equilibrium condi-
tions would require optimization of the combustion chamber geometry, which

is left for future work.

7. Conclusions

This work developed a novel concept to burn partially cracked ammonia
at gas turbine conditions that enables low reactive nitrogen emission without
increasing residence times. Reactive nitrogen emissions in AHN combustion
are controlled by the very different approach to thermodynamic equilibrium
compared to hydrocarbon fuels. In hydrocarbon combustion, reactive nitro-
gen emissions increase rapidly very near thermodynamic equilibrium favor-
ing not too long residence times, but, in AHN combustion, reactive nitrogen
emissions peak within the reaction zone and then relax toward thermody-
namic equilibrium favoring long residence times. In AHN combustion, the
“unrelaxed” emissions make up most of the reactive nitrogen emissions, so
the rush-to-equilibrium combustion concept seeks to accelerate the approach
to equilibrium without increasing residence time.

From fundamental budget analysis of premixed flames, while a fast mix-
ing rate is required for transport within the preheat zone, fast mixing inhibits
the approach to equilibrium. Therefore, in the rush-to-equilibrium combus-
tion concept, a flow particle experiences a decaying mixing rate, faster in the

preheat zone and decaying toward equilibrium. For typical gas turbine con-

30
ditions, at a fixed residence time, the rush-to-equilibrium concept gets much
closer to thermodynamic equilibrium. This results in substantially reduced
reactive nitrogen emissions, on the order of an order of magnitude, for even
modest mixing decay rates and even reaching thermodynamic equilibrium
for faster decay rates. The rush-to-equilibrium concept could be practically
implemented with a diffuser-shaped combustion chamber with very reason-
able geometric and flow conditions for modest decay rates, and future work

will focus on realization of the rush-to-equilibrium concept.
