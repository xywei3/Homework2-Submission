ABSTRACT

We have observed the low-mass molecular cloud core G204.4-11.3A2-NE (G204NE) in the direction
of Orion B giant molecular cloud with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Band
6. The 1.3 mm continuum images and visibilities unveil a compact central structure with a radius
of ~12 au, while showing no signature of binarity down to 18 au. The bolometric temperature and
luminosity of this source are derived to be ~33 K and ~1.15 Lo, respectively. Chemical stratification
is observed in dense gas tracers, with C!8O emission peaking at the continuum position surrounded
y the spatially extended emission of NgD+ and DCO*. This implies that the core is in a very early
evolutionary stage in which CO depletion occurs in most regions except for a small area heated by
he central source. The envelope kinematics indicates a rotating and infalling structure with a central
rotostar mass of 0.08-0.1 Mg. The protostar drives a collimated outflow traced by CO, SiO, SO,
and H2CO, with misaligned blueshifted and redshifted lobes exhibiting a pair of bow-like patterns.
High-velocity jets, extending up to 720 au, are detected in CO, SiO, and SO lines. The jet launching
region is likely within twice of the dust sublimation zone. The absence of a binary signature suggests
he outflows and jets are driven by a single protostar, although a close binary cannot be ruled out.
The observed deflection of the outflows and jet is likely due to turbulent accretion in a moderately
magnetized core.

1. INTRODUCTION

Investigating the initial conditions of protostellar col-
lapse is crucial for comprehending the formation pro-
cess of low-mass stars. Young stellar objects (YSOs) in
the earliest stage of protostellar evolution—the Class 0
phase—are suitable objects in studying the initial condi-
tion of star formation because their natal cores are con-
sidered to retain these primordial characteristics. On
the other hand, the circumstellar structure evolves sig-
nificantly in this stage: observational studies have sug-
gested that circumstellar disks start to form in the Class
0 phase (e.g., Tobin et al. 2012; Murillo & Lai 2013;
Aso et al. 2017, 2018). Furthermore, protostars begin

Broadway, New York, NY 10027, USA; he3557@columbia.edu

to elevate the temperatures in their surrounding envi-
ronments, consequently modifying the chemical prop-
erties of their enclosing envelopes (e.g., Aikawa et al.
2012; Hirano & Liu 2014; Harsono et al. 2015; Tychoniec
et al. 2021). Energetic jets and outflows generated by
protostars interact with their surrounding environment.
These interactions can create cavities within their na-
tal cores, initiate shock waves, and generate turbulence
(e.g., Bachiller 1996; Frank et al. 2014; Bally 2016; Lee
2020).

G204.4-11.3 A2 located in the direction of Orion B gi-
ant molecular cloud is a cold gas clump (Zygust~11 K)
discovered by the Planck all-sky survey (Planck Col-
laboration et al. 2016). As shown in Figure 1 c, the
James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) Submillimeter
Common-User Bolometer Array 2 (SCUBA-2) 850 ym
image shows two peaks connected by low-level emis-
2

sion stretching from the east to the southwest. The SW
peak (G204SW) is associated with a bright source in the
Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) 22 ym im-
age, while the NE peak (G204NE), which is brighter in
the 850 jum image, lacks a corresponding source at 22
pm. The absence of a 22 um source suggests that the
G204NE molecular cloud core is at an early evolution-
ary stage. Chemical properties of the core also support
this hypothesis. The N.Ht 1-0 emission peaks toward
G204NE (Tatematsu et al. 2017). In addition, G204NE
shows a high abundance of deuterated species; the col-
umn density ratio of N(N2D*)/N(N2H*) was measured
to be 0.27 (Kim et al. 2020), which is comparable to
those of the evolved prestellar cores (Crapsi et al. 2005).
Out of the 74 protostellar cores located within the Orion
region (A Orionis, Orion A, and Orion B) studied by Kim
et al. (2020), only five cores, including G204NE, display
a N(N2Dt)/N(N2H*) ratio exceeding 0.25. The ob-
served physical properties (centrally peaked continuum
emission and high column density) and chemical prop-
erties (NpH* peak and high D/H ratio) suggest that
G204NE is an ideal object for studying the initial condi-
tion of low-mass star formation. In this paper, we report
the Band 6 Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter
Array (ALMA) observations of G204NE. We present our
investigation of the 1.3 mm continuum and the molec-
ular lines: NoD*+ 3-2, CO 2-1, SO 65-54, ClO 2-1,
H2CO 32,2 — 29,1, H2CO 39,3 — 20,2, DCN 3—2, SiO 5—4,
and DCO* 3-2.

The typical distance to the Orion B GMC is esti-
mated to be ~ 403 + 4 pe (Kounkel et al. 2018). How-
ever, Lynds 1622 (L1622), a dark cloud located near
G204NE, stands out with a much closer estimated dis-
tance of < 360 pe (Tobin et al. 2020). The radial velocity
of L1622 was measured to be upgp ~ 1 km s~! (Mad-
dalena et al. 1986), which is different from that of Orion
B, vrsr ~ 10 km s~!. Since the systemic velocity of
G204NE, vpsrp ~ 1.4 km s~! (see Section 4.2), is close
to that of L1622 rather than that of Orion B, we as-
sume that G204NE is also on the near side of the Orion
B GMC and adopt 360 pc as the distance in this paper.

The outline of this paper is as follows. Details regard-
ing the ALMA 1.3 mm observations, as well as the Sub-
millimeter Array! (SMA; Ho et al. 2004) 1.1 mm and
Atacama Compact Array (ACA) 830 ym observations
used for the spectral energy distribution (SED) analy-
sis (see Section 3.1), are summarized in Section 2. In

nian Astrophysical Observatory and the Academia Sinica Insti-
tute of Astronomy and Astrophysics and is funded by the Smith-
sonian Institution and the Academia Sinica.

Section 3, we present the results of the SED, the con-
tinuum, and the molecular lines. Analyses of molecular
abundances, envelope kinematics, and the jets and out-
flows are presented in Section 4. The implications of our
results and analyses are discussed in Section 5. Finally,
we summarize the conclusions of this study in Section 6.

2. OBSERVATIONS
2.1. ALMA 1.3 mm

We observed G204NE with ALMA in Band 6 during
Cycle 4 (Project ID: 2017.1.00707.S, PI: Naomi Hirano).
Two different array configurations were used: 12 m C43-
5 (TM1) and 12 m C43-2 (TM2). The four execution
blocks (EBs) of the TM1 observations were carried out
in 2017 on November 26, December 3, and December
6 with 50, 47, and 45 antennas, respectively. The two
EBs of the TM2 were carried out in 2018 on April 11
and 18, with 43 and 45 antennas, respectively. The field
center of the observations is a(J2000) = 05"55™38°.430,
6(J2000) = 2°11'33”.30. The projected baseline lengths
of the two array configurations range from 15.1 m to
8547.6 m for TM1 and from 15.1 m to 500.2 m for TM2.
The maximum recoverable scale of the TM1 dataset was
1’”.6, and that of the TM2 dataset was 8.1. The cor-
relator was configured to accommodate nine molecular
lines: NoD+ 3 — 2, CO 2-1, SO 65 — 54, C48O 2-1,
H2CO 32,2 — 22,1, H2CO 39,3 — 20,2, DCN 3—2, SiO 5—4,
and DCO* 3-2. The spectral resolutions of the lines
were either 122 kHz or 141 kHz, which correspond to
velocity resolutions of ~ 0.16 — 0.2 km s~? as listed in
Table 1. The total bandwidths were either 58.6 MHz (~
80 km s~!) or 117.2 MHz (~ 150 — 160 km s~?). In ad-
dition, a broad-band spectral window with a bandwidth
of 1.875 GHz and a spectral resolution of 31.25 MHz
centered at a frequency of 233.0 GHz was dedicated to
observing the continuum emission.

2.1.1. Calibration and CLEAN Imaging

Both TM1 and TM2 data were calibrated using the
Common Astronomical Software Applications (CASA;
CASA Team et al. 2022) version 5.1.1 and the ALMA
Pipeline 40896 (Pipeline-CASA51-P2-B). The TM1 ob-
servations used J0510 — 1800 as bandpass and flux cali-
brators, while the TM2 observations used J0522 — 3627
and J0423 — 0120 as both bandpass and flux calibrators.
For both TM1 and TM2, J0552 + 0313 was used as the
gain calibrator.

In addition, we performed self-calibration and imaging
on the continuum data using the tasks tclean, gaincal,
and applycal in CASA version 6.5.0. We applied self-

calibration onto two visibility datasets: one with only
TM1 and another with TM1 and TM2 combined (here-
after “TM1+TM2”). For TM1 data, three rounds
of self-calibration were performed: the first and second
steps are phase calibrations with solution intervals of
inf, and the third step is amplitude and phase calibra-
tions with solution intervals of inf. For TM1+TM2
data, two rounds of phase self-calibration were per-
formed with solution intervals of inf. Self-calibration
improved the signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) of both TM1
and TM1+TM2 continuum maps by ~ 30% compared to
those of the non-self-calibrated CLEAN images. The
obtained calibration table was also applied to the line
visibility data.

Briggs weighting with a robust parameter of +0.5 was
applied to both datasets in tclean, and CLEAN masks
were determined by the auto-masking algorithm. The
parameters employed for the auto-masking procedure
were the standard values” pertinent to the 12 m array
with the 75th percentile of baselines exceeding 400 m.

TM1+TM2 image exhibits a non-Gaussian shape with a
substantial shelf surrounding the central Gaussian core.
We tried to compare the beam shapes of the TM1+TM2
continuum images using different uv taper values, and
found that the one with a uv taper of 0.2 could pro-
vide reasonably good beam shape without degrading the
angular resolution. The synthesized beam size of the
TMI continuum map is ~ 0.078, which corresponds to
~ 28 au at a distance of 360 pc. The beam size of the
TM1+TM2 continuum map with a uv taper of 0”.2 is
~ 0.30 (~ 108 au). Both of the continuum maps were
primary beam corrected with impbcor.

We obtained the line data cubes from the TM1+TM2
visibility data in CASA version 6.1.0. The contin-
uum was subtracted from the line data using the task
uvcontsub. Line-free channels were determined in the
time-averaged spectra of the TM2 visibility data. Using
the tclean task, we applied Briggs weighting with a ro-
bust parameter of +0.5, as well as a UV taper of 0.2.
The synthesized beam sizes of the TM1+TM2 line data
cubes are ~ 0.29, which corresponds ~ 108 au. In or-
der to spatially resolve the compact jet components (see
Section 3.3.2), we made a higher-resolution SiO data
cube using the TM1 data without UV taper. The syn-
thesized beam of the high-resolution SiO data cube was
~ 0.096 (~ 36 au). The C180, NoDt, and DCO? lines

were imaged every 0.1 km s~!, while the H,CO, SO,
SiO, and CO lines were imaged every 0.2 km s~!. All
line images presented in this paper have been primary
beam corrected using the task impbcor.

The synthesized beam size and the rms noise level per
channel of each molecular line are summarized in Table
1. The rms noise levels were measured before primary
beam correction.

2.1.2. Super-resolution Imaging with Sparse Modeling

We used PRIISM ® version 0.11.5 (Nakazato & Ikeda
2020) to image a higher-resolution TM1 continuum map
with sparse modeling (SpM). This package involves regu-
larized maximum-likelihood optimizations with ¢;+TSV
imaging and the cross-validation (CV) scheme as illus-
trated in Yamaguchi et al. (2020, 2021). The model im-
age is reproduced by minimizing a cost function, which is
the chi-square error between the visibility model derived
by the model image and observed visibility. This is ac-
companied by two regularization terms, £;-norm and the
total squared variation (TSV), which are parameterized
by A; and Ajsy, respectively. With the self-calibrated
TM1 visibility data, we obtain a model image that min-
imizes the cost function for a given set of (Az, Aisv) and
has a set of model images with a range of values of
(Aj, Aisy). To select a pair of (Aj, Aisv) for the opti-
mal image, we employ the 10-fold cross-validation (CV)
approach. The model with minimum cross-validation
error (CVE) is set to the optimal one (Yamaguchi et al.
2020). The final pairs for (Ay, Ars.) with the minimum
CVE provided (10°, 3 x 10!3). The final model image
has units of Jy pixel~! instead of Jy beam~! because
this imaging process does not involve beam convolution.

We evaluated the effective spatial resolution 6. of the
SpM image using the “point-source injection” method
outlined in Yamaguchi et al. (2021). We injected an
artificial point source into the observed visibility data.
The flux density of the point source was set to 10%
of the total flux density of the target. The artificial
point source was north-placed in an emission-free area
but at a distance within the maximum recoverable scale

(< 0”.7 in radius). The imaging was performed for the
point-source injected data using the same set of regular-
ization parameters employed for generating the optimal
image of non-injected data. The intensity distribution
of each injected point source was Gaussian-like in the
reconstructed image; therefore, we fitted it with an el-

liptical Gaussian function to measure the full widths at
half maxima (FWHMs), which can be regarded as an
effective spatial resolution. The effective spatial resolu-
tion is 0.055 x 0.046 (~ 18 au; P.A. = 83°), which is
an improvement over that of the TM1 CLEAN image by
a factor of ~ 1.6. The information regarding the SpM
image above is summarized in Table 1.

We were unable to measure the noise level of the SpM
continuum map, as the background noise pattern of the
image does not follow the Gaussian distribution.

2.2. SMA 1.1 mm and 1.8 mm

The 1.1 mm (280 GHz) and 1.3 mm (230 GHz) con-
inuum observations were carried out in 2017 on April
21 with the compact configuration of the SMA (Project
ID: 2016B-A013; PI: Naomi Hirano). The two frequency
bands were observed simultaneously using the 240 GHz
and 345 GHz receivers. The frequency coverages of the
240 GHz receiver were from 215.5 to 221.5 GHz in the
ower sideband (LSB) and from 229.5 to 235.5 GHz in
he upper sideband (USB), while those of the 345 GHz
receiver were from 264.5 to 270.5 GHz in the LSB and
from 278.5 to 284.5 GHz in the USB. The field cen-
er of the observations was a(J2000) = 05"55™38*.400,
6(J2000) = 02°11/35"".50.

Calibration was performed using the MIR/IDL soft-
ware package *. J0510 +180 and J0607 — 085 were used
as the gain calibrators, 3C 279 was used as the band-
pass calibrator, and Callisto was used as the flux cal-
ibrator. The continuum image was obtained in CASA
version 6.1.0 using the tclean task with Briggs weight-
ing and a robust parameter of +0.5. The continuum
emission was obtained by averaging the line-free chan-
nels. To improve the S/N, we combined the USB and
LSB data. The SMA synthesized beams are 2.8 x 2.3
(P.A. = 72°) and 3”.4 x 2”.9 (P.A. = —88°) for the
280 GHz and 230 GHz images, respectively. The rms
noise levels were measured by including emission-free re-
gions to be ~ 2.2 mJy beam! and ~ 2.4 mJy beam=!
for the 280 GHz and 230 GHz images, respectively.

2.3. ACA 830 um

The ACA Band 7 observations of G204NE were
carried out at 830 ym during Cycle 7 (Project ID:
2021.1.00727.S; PI: Naomi Hirano). The three EBs in
2021 on November 8, 11, and 29 used 10, 9, and 8 an-
tennas of 7 m diameters, respectively. The field cen-
ter of the observations is a(J2000) = 05'34™55%.840,
6(J2000) = —05°46'05”.00. The projected baseline
lengths range from 8.9 m to 45 m. The observations

molecular lines to future papers.

Calibration was performed in CASA version 6.2.1-7
(Pipeline 2021.2.0.128). J0541-0541 was used as the gain
calibrator, while J0423-0120 was used as the bandpass
and flux calibrators. After checking the weblog, we de-
cided to use the clean images produced by the pipeline.

The pipeline adopted the Briggs weighting with a_ro-
bust parameter of +0.5. The ACA synthesized beam is

sured from the emission-free region is 10 mJy beam™!.

3. RESULTS
3.1. Spectral Energy Distribution

Figure l(a) shows the spectral energy distribution
(SED) plot derived from the WISE 3.4, 4.6, 12, and
22 yum; Herschel 70 and 160 wm; ACA 830 pm; JCMT
SCUBA-2 850 ym (Tatematsu et al. 2017); SMA 1.1 and
1.3 mm; and ALMA 1.3 mm observations. The flux mea-
surements of the WISE and Herschel data were obtained
from the SIMBAD database (url: simbad.u-strasbg.fr/).
The flux measurements of the ACA, JCMT, SMA, and
ALMA were performed using the circular aperture. We
quote a nominal 10% absolute flux error for the interfer-
ometric data and a 5% for SCUBA-2 data, as they are
larger than the lo thermal noise levels. We excluded
the Herschel 250, 350, and 500 jm observations as the
flux measurements at these wavelengths were contam-
inated by the extended emission from the cloud due
to larger beam sizes. The flux measurements for the
SED are listed in Table 2. The 830 jum flux measured
with the ACA is lower than the 850 jum flux measured
with the JCMT. This discrepancy arises from the inher-
ent tendency of the interferometer to filter out spatially
extended emission. However, the difference is ~10%,
which is not significant if the flux uncertainties are taken
into account.

The SED at the wavelength longer than 70 jum was
fitted with the form of greybody radiation with a single
emissivity, 3, and a temperature, Tyust,

Fy = QB, (Taust)(1 -— e7™) (1)

where F, is the flux density, Q is the solid angle of
the emitting region, B,(Taust) is the Planck function,
Taust is the dust temperature, and 7, is the optical
depth of dust that is assumed to be proportional to
v®. The derived parameters, Tyust, 8, T230GHz, and the
source radius r = ,/In 20/7 are 26.8+0.3 K, 2.44+0.70,
0.14+0.04, and 0614001, respectively. It should be
noted that the beta value derived from the current

dataset lacks reliability, as it suddenly changes to ~
1.2 when an assumed source size exceeds (76. To ac-
curately derive the beta value, the data points at lower
frequency bands are required. On the other hand, the
dust temperature is invariant with respect to the source
size, remaining consistently between 25-27 K.

As shown in Figures 1(c) and (d), G204NE was de-
tected in the Herschel 70 zm observation but not in the
WISE 22 ym observation. At 70 um, G204NE is fainter
than the neighboring core G204SW, which contains the
22 yum source. On the other hand, G204NE is brighter
than G204SW at 850 um. Although G204NE is gener-
ally not detected at wavelengths of < 22 jm, some faint

Following Myers & Ladd (1993), we used the flux-
weighted mean frequency 7 = i vF,dv/ Ee F,dv in
the observed SED to estimate the bolometric tempera-
ture Tyo1, which can be given as:

Thoi = 1.25 x 107! (K Hz~') (2)

or Herschel 70 ym, respectively.

Similarly, the bolometric luminosity can also be ob-
tained through integration:

distance to G204NE. We evalu-
rapezoidal Riemann sums over

the flux measurements rather than fitting. To estimate
the uncertainties in Tj,,) and Ly.) due to the flux un-

certainties, we employed

a Monte Carlo approach. Each

detected flux was modeled as a Gaussian distribution
centered on the measured value, with a standard devi-
ation equal to its uncertainty. For flux upper limits,
we assumed a truncated Gaussian distribution centered
at zero, with a standard deviation equal to one-third
of the quoted upper limit (i.e., corresponding to a 3a
threshold), and truncated between zero and the limit
value. We then generated 10° synthetic realizations
of the SED by randomly sampling from these distribu-
tions and measured the 7j,,; and L,,) for each realiza-
tion. The resulting distributions of the measurements of
Tpo1 and Lyo1 were found to be approximately Gaussian;
hence, the means of the Jj.) and Ly.) measurements
were adopted as the final values, and their standard de-
viations (lo) were taken as the uncertainties. This pro-
vided Tho) = 32.7+0.2 K and Lpo1 = 1.15 £ 0.02 Lo,
placing G204NE below the J,,) = 70 K threshold be-
tween the Class 0 and Class I phases (Chen et al. 1995).
The flux measurements at 1.1 mm and 1.3 mm were
acquired using interferometers that lack sensitivity to
extended structures. Nonetheless, the impact of this fil-
tering issue is unlikely to substantially affect the estima-
tion of Tyo1 and Ly. The flux disparity between ACA
(830 zm) and JCMT (850 jum) is only ~10%. The Tho
and Lo) values remain at 33.0 K and 1.15 Zo, when the
flux measurements at 1.1 mm and 1.3 mm are doubled,

which corresponds to the assumption that half of the
flux was lost.

3.2. 1.3 mm Continuum Emission

Figures 2(a) and (b) show the TM1 1.3 mm contin-
uum emission maps of G204NE generated with CLEAN
and SpM, respectively, which have higher resolutions
more suitable for inspecting the compact emissions of
the source than the TM1+TM2. In the CLEAN image,
the emission exhibits a structure with a radius of ~ 0/”.2
(72 au) at the 10o contour level. The intensity at the
peak is ~ 14 mJy beam~!. This corresponds to a bright-
ness temperature of ~ 52 K, which can be regarded as
the dust temperature by assuming optical thickness. No
substructures or close binaries are detected, even in the
SpM image with an effective resolution of ~ 0.05, al-
though we do not dismiss the possibility of such compo-
nents being spatially unresolved. We also note that the
scattered patterns surrounding the central source, in-
cluding the circular patches in the northeast and south-

west, are likely sidelobes in the SpM image, as they
are consistent with the point-spread function pattern
of the TM1 CLEAN image. For both the CLEAN
and SpM images, the peak position measured by el-
iptical Gaussian fitting is a(J2000) = 05"55™38°.197,
6(J2000) = 2°11/33”.59. The fitting includes emission
within the 100 contour for the CLEAN image and within

7

the ~ 10 pJy pixel? level for the SpM image. In this
paper, we treat the continuum peak position as the cen-
tral protostellar position, and all maps are centered on
this position.

Figure 3 shows the visibility plot derived by averag-
ing all scans for each pair of antennas from the com-
bined TM1+TM2 dataset. As shown by the red curve
in Figure 3, the visibility profile can be well-fitted by
three Gaussian components centered at zero with size
scales of 0’”.066 + 0.0021 (24+ 0.76 au), 0.23 + 0.010
(83 + 3.6 au), and 2”.16 + 0”.073 (780 + 26 au) in
FWHM. The flux amplitudes given by the fitting are
17.7 £0.93 mJy, 25.7 + 1.01 mJy, 68.6 + 1.80 mJy for
the smallest to largest components, respectively. The
extremely compact continuum component suggests that
a small circumstellar disk with a radius of ~ 12 au,

which is spatially unresolved in the image domain, has
been formed in the early Class 0 stage. Meanwhile, the
intermediate 0’.23 (83 au) component could represent
the inner part of the envelope where the material is be-
ing accreted into the disk. It is worth noting that there
is no multiplicity at the current resolution.

By assuming optical thinness and a gas-to-dust ratio
of 100, we can estimate the lower limit of the mass of
each individual component with the following equation:

where F/, is the total continuum flux density of the com-
ponent derived from the visibility fitting, D = 360 pc is
he distance to G204NE, k, is the opacity coefficient,
By, is the Planck function, and Tyust is the dust tem-
perature. The dust opacity per unit mass of gas and
dust was assumed to follow «, ~ 0.01 cm? g~ at rest
requency v ~ 233 GHz (Ossenkopf & Henning 1994).
The Tyust Was assumed to be 50 K for the most compact
component and 25 K for both the intermediate and ex-
ended components, where the latter value corresponds
approximately to the dust temperature derived from the
SED fitting (Section 3.1). We derived the three masses
o be 2 0.015, 2 0.049, and = 0.13 Mo for the smallest

o largest components, respectively.

and shows an S-shaped pattern at the 100 contour level;
these features are not present in the TM1-only images
(see Section 3.2). The masses of the northern and south-
ern arms surrounded by the 10 o contour are estimated
to be 0.015 Mo and 0.006 Mo, respectively, using Equa-
tion 4 and the same assumptions as the intermediate and
extended components.

The spatial distribution of the molecular lines demon-
strates significant chemical stratification. Strong C10
is detected toward the continuum peak, tracing the cen-
tral compact component. The beam-deconvolved size

of the C!8O emitting region derived from the ellipti-
cal Gaussian fitting is 1/34 x 1/.27 (P.A. = —7.1°) in
FWHM (~ 470 au in geometric mean). This suggests
hat C180 is tracing the inner, warmer region of the
envelope where CO is less depleted. Furthermore, the
spatially compact C!80 indicates a small CO evapora-
ion radius of ~ 240 au around the embedded protostar.
In contrast, NogD+ and DCO* lines reveal the spa-
ially extended distributions beyond the 5¢ contour of
he continuum emission. An additional, fainter compo-
nent extending from the south of the continuum source
o the east is seen in both NoD+ and DCO?* (dashed el-
ipses in Figure 4c and 4e, respectively). This emission
component likely traces the northern edge of the curved
emission feature linking two cores seen in the SCUBA-2
image. Near the protostar, the spatial extent of DCOt
is in-between those of C830 and NoDt: NgDt is de-
tected in most regions surrounding the protostar, while
DCO* mainly traces extensions to the north and to the
northeast. Moreover, both N2D* and DCO? exhibit a
central hole and show anti-correlation with C180 and
the continuum emission. This anti-correlation indicates
that the N»D+ and DCO* lines are likely tracing the
outer, colder regions where CO is frozen onto the dust
and deuterium fractionation is enhanced. On the other
hand, we detected no emission above 30 level in the
DCN line. This also suggests the extended component
surrounding the protostar is cold. Since the major for-
mation path of DCN is from CH2D* in the temperature

ature.

3.3.2. Outflow and Jet Tracers

Figure 5 shows the moment 0 (contour) and moment
1 (color) maps of the CO, SiO, SO, and two transi-
tions of H2CO (hereafter referred to as H2CO 393 and
H2CO 322). The integrated velocity range is +20 km
s~! from the cloud systemic velocity, sy; =1.4 km s~!
(see Section 4.2). Highly-collimated outflow along the
north-south direction is observed in all these molecular
lines. As seen in the moment 1 maps, the northern lobe
is blueshifted and the southern lobe is redshifted. The
position angle of the blueshifted lobe is ~ —15°, while
that of the redshifted lobe is ~ 200°. As shown in the
CO channel maps (Figures A4 and A5), the eastern wall
of the northern lobe having a position angle of ~ —5°
(yellow dashed line in Figures A4 and A5) appears only
in the low-velocity channels of —3 < Vobs — Usys < —1
km s~!. In the velocity range of —6 < Vobs — Usys < —3
! emission comes from the western wall with a
position angle of ~ —22° (blue dashed line in Figures
A4 and A5). Such a velocity asymmetry is also seen in
the southern lobe; the western wall that is seen in the
velocity channels of Vops — Usys < 4 km st disappears in
the higher velocity channels. The velocity asymmetry in
the northern lobe is commonly observed in all molecular
lines, while that in the southern lobe is less significant in
the H2CO lines. The farthest tips of the blueshifted and
redshifted lobes exhibit a pair of bow-like patterns la-
beled NE and NW in the northern tip and SE and SW in
the southern tip. The bow-like patterns, which are most
prominently observed in the CO and H2CO 30,3 (Figures
5(a) and (d)), are likely attributable to interactions with
the surrounding gas. Both northern and southern lobes
are spatially extended up to 2 11.5” (4140 an).

The CO channel map in the low velocity range (Fig-
ure A5) shows that the CO emission extends to the
NE in the redshifted velocity range. Since the low-
velocity redshifted component extends along the axis of
the southern lobe, this NE component could be another
outflow lobe. This component is observed only in CO.
The observed low radial velocity is attributed either to
the inclination angle being nearly parallel to the plane
of the sky or to the intrinsically low velocity. The latter
case of intrinsically low velocity outflow is expected if
this component is driven when the central source was in
the first hydrostatic core stage. However, the nature of
this low-velocity redshifted component is not well under-
stood because the blueshifted counterpart of this com-

km s~

ponent is unclear. The CO emission in the low-velocity
blueshifted component ( Figure A5) extends towards the
southeast; however, the spatial distribution of the low-
velocity blueshifted component is amorphous and does
not point to the central source. Figure 6 compares the
spatial distributions of the continuum emission and the
low-velocity outflow components. It illustrates that the
S-shaped feature seen in the continuum emission out-
lines the boundaries of the outflow lobes: the northern
arm extends between the base of the NE component and
the blueshifted lobe, and the southern arm aligns with
the eastern boundary of the redshifted lobe.

The CO, SiO, and SO lines exhibit higher velocity
emission at |vops — Usys| 2 18 km s-!. As shown in Fig-
ures 7(a)-(c), this extremely high-velocity component is
spatially compact and highly collimated. It is likely that
his extremely high-velocity emission comes from the jet.
The blueshifted jet in the north and redshifted jet in
he south have position angles of ~ —30° and ~ 90°,
respectively. The jets are extended up to ~ 2” (720 au).
Several knot-like structures with a separation of ~0/5
are observed along the jet axes. The SiO emission is
brightest in the innermost knot pair labeled bl and rl,
and becomes fainter in the outer knots. In contrast to
SiO, the SO emission tends to be bright in the outer
nots, especially at the r4 knot, and barely seen in the
innermost knots. All of the knots are seen in the CO,
although the innermost r1 knot is fainter than its coun-
erpart bl knot.

The 0/1 resolution image of the SiO jet observed with
TM1 (Figure 8) reveals its detailed structure. At high
resolution, the innermost pair of knots, rl and bl, are
elongated along the jet axes. The transverse widths of
these knots after deconvolved with the beam are ~21
au in rl and ~27 au in bl. In addition to the brightest
peaks labeled rlb and b1b, there are additional emission
peaks rla, rlc, and ble. The elongated structure with
sub-knots observed in rl and bl is quite similar to that
of HH211 (Lee et al. 2009; Jhan & Lee 2021).

4. ANALYSIS
4.1. Molecular Abundances

To estimate the fractional abundances (N(X)/N(H2))
of C180, NoDt, and DCO*, we first individually derived
the molecular column densities using different assump-
tions. Then, we divided the molecular column densities
by the Hz column density derived from the continuum
emission. If we assume that the continuum emission is
optically thin, the Hz column density can be related to
the continuum flux density as in the following equation:

umn density to be ~ 8.0 x 10?3 cm~? for the inner region

and ~ 1.8 x 107° em~? for the outer region. Since the
optically thin assumption is not valid for the innermost
region, the Hz column density at r < 0.5 derived here
is the lower limit.

4.1.1. C'8O Abundance

We derived the C!8O column density by assuming
the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) condition.
Since the spatial distribution of the C!8O emission cor-
relates well with that of the continuum emission, we as-
sumed that the line emission comes from the same region
as the continuum, and that the line excitation temper-
ature is same as the dust temperature. The continuum
inte

ity Icon Can be related to the dust optical depth
Ta using the radiative transfer equation as

Teont = (By(T) — By (Tyg))(1 — e-*) (6)

where B,, T, Ty, = 2.7 K are the Planck function, the
excitation/ dust temperature, and the cosmic microwave
background temperature, respectively. The line inten-
sity [ine before continuum subtraction is given by

Tine = (Bu(T) — By(Tpg))(L— e 7) (7)

where Tg is the gas optical depth.

Assuming T = 50 K for the inner r < 0.5 region
and T = 25 K for the outer 0.5 < r < 1.5 region, we
calculated the gas optical depth at each channel from
observed intensities > 50 and estimated the integrated
gas optical depth, f Tgdv, by summing over the values
at each channel. Then, we calculated the C80 column
densities from the integrated gas optical depths using
the following equation from Mangum & Shirley (2015):

profiles in the inner and outer regions have two peaks
with a dip in Vusp~ 1.6 km s-!. The observed dip is
likely attributable to absorption from the spatially ex-
tended foreground component. Consequently, the C!8O
column densities previously derived may be underesti-
mated. Nevertheless, it is improbable that this absorp-
tion feature reduces the column densities by an entire
order of magnitude.

cm~? in the inner r < 0”.5 region and ~ 2.1 x 1044

cm~? in the outer 0.5 <r < 1”.5 region. The NoDt+
abundance is thus ~ 8.0 x 107!° in the inner region and
~1.1 x 107}? in the outer region. The uncertainties in
the abundance values, which stem from the uncertain-
ties linked to the Hz column densities and the rms noise
level of the spectra, are estimated to be ~(3—4) x 10714.
Therefore, the observed reduction in the NgD* abun-

dance within the inner region is noteworthy. The drop
in N2D* abundance near the protostellar position is con-
sistent with the explanation that the early-phase proto-
star has started to heat the gas and evaporate CO from
the dust, which then reacts with N2D+ to form DCO?t.

1.3. DCO* Abundance

We used the same assumptions of LTE, optical thin-
ness, and Tx = 15 K to derive the DCO+ column den-
sities. We also used the same assumption for the back-
ground temperature, i.e. T,, = 2.7 K for the outer re-
gion and J, (Tg) = 2.2 K for the inner region. In certain
channels, the DCO* line shows a dip below the con-
tinuum level. Since the brightness temperature at the
bottom of the dip is close to zero, the dip can likely be
attributed to the foreground low-excitation component.
(Figure 9(c)). Therefore, we excluded channels where
the absorption is shown (i.e., Vops = 1.4 — 1.8 km st)
in our calculations.

The column densities of DCOt in the inner r < 0”.5
region and the outer 0.5 < r < 1.5 region are
~ 3.7 x 10! cm~? and ~ 8.8 x 10!4 cm~?, respectively.
The derived DCOt abundances in the inner and outer
regions are not significantly different, ~ 4.6 x 10~® and
~ 4.8x 10~°, respectively. The derived column densities
and abundance values of DCO+ presented in this study
represent the lower limits for both the inner and outer
regions, as the velocity channels exhibiting absorption
features were omitted from the column density calcula-
tions of DCO*.

4.2. Envelope Kinematics
Figure 10(a) shows the C180 intensity-weighted aver-
age velocity (moment 1) map as the color map and the
continuum as the contour map. The complete channel
maps are also shown in Figure Al in Appendix A. The

C180 velocity distribution exhibits a blueshifted compo-
nent to the east and a redshifted component to the west.
Since this velocity gradient is approximately perpendic-
ular to the outflow axes, it is interpreted as a rotational
motion of the envelope. In the channel map (Figure
A1), the emission with large velocity offsets appears in
the vicinity of the central source, suggesting that the in-
ner region is rotating faster. The spatial distributions of
the high velocity components presented in Figure 10(b)
reveals that the blueshifted component is located in the
NE and the redshifted component is in the SW of the
central source. The orientation of the velocity gradient
has been determined to be P.A. ~ 60° from the positions
of the emission centroids at channels with |vops — Wave >
0.8 km s~!. Therefore, we assume that the envelope is
rotating around the axis with a position angle of ~—30°,
which is parallel to the axis of the blueshifted jet.
Figure 11(a) shows the position-velocity (PV) diagram
along the velocity gradient, i.e. P.A. = 60°. As expected
rom the line profile (Figure 9(a)) the blueshifted com-
ponent in the second quadrant is brighter than the red-
shifted component in the fourth quadrant. The P-V
diagram exhibits the spin-up feature in which the rota-
ional velocity increases toward the central source. The

ow-velocity emission extends on either side of the cen-
ral source, and exhibits two triangular structures with
heir tips point to the highest blue- and redshifted ve-
ocities. Such a two-triangular feature has often been
observed in protostellar envelopes, and has been inter-
preted as an infalling motion (e.g. Ohashi et al. 1997).
The spin-up feature of the envelope has been exam-
ined using the rotational velocities as a function of ra-
dius. Following Yen et al. (2013), we adopted different
methods to the inner and outer part; the intensity pro-
file at each velocity channel for the inner high-velocity
part with |vops — Usys | > 0.8 km s~!, and the spectral
profile at a given position for the outer low-velocity part.
We derived an intensity-weighted position for the inner
part. For the outer part, each spectral profile was fit-
ed with double-Gaussian, and the velocity of the bluer
component is adopted in the NE side, and that of the
redder component is adopted in the SW side. The ro-
ational velocities derived in these methods are plotted
on the P-V diagram (Figure 11(a)).
Figure 11(b) presents the power-law dependence of the
rotational profile. A least-square fitting, using a power
aw (x r®), to all the data points provides an index a of
—0.49+0.03, which is expected for the case of Keplerian
rotation, —0.5, and different from —1 for the infall with
angular momentum conservation. In the case of Keple-
rian rotation, the central mass enclosed within a radius
of ~ 45 au is estimated to be (0.071 + 0.001)/cos? i,

ixel. If we assume

hat the emission is optically thin, then the intensities
would be proportional to the column densities. We per-

he simulated three-

agrams of the simulated observations. They found that
the rotational profiles of the simulated observations tend
to have shallower slopes than those of the input values.
The rotational profile of x r~°-* is also derived from the
three-dimensional infalling and rotating envelope mod-
els of Mori et al. (2024). As discussed in Yen et al. (2013)
and Mori et al. (2024), the observed shallower rotational
profiles can be attributed to the contribution of the ra-
dially infalling gas to the line-of-sight velocities. Thus,
the rotational profile of x r~°> observed in the enve-
lope of G204NE is not necessarily a result of Keplerian

rotation.
Therefore, we analyzed the observed P-V diagram us-

ing a simple toy model of a rotating and infalling en-
velope. For simplicity, we assumed a flattened envelope
structure with a radius of Reny = 540 au, which cor-

responds approximately to the largest positional offset
traced by the 50 contour in the P-V diagram (Figure
a). Following Sakai et al. (2014), we assumed that
the flared envelope has bipolar conical cavities of full
opening angles 6. Here, 6 = 180° represents the case of
a spatially thin disk, while 6 = 0° represents that of a
sphere with no cavity. For this model, we assume that
both the total energy and the angular momentum are
conserved in the infalling material. We also assumed a
large opening angle of 6 > 130° to allow for a small angle
approximation error of < 10%. Thus, the magnitudes
of the infall velocity ving and the rotational velocity vyot

H

can be related to the specific angular momentum J, the
radius from central protostar rcen, the shortest distance
to the axis of rotation rax, and the stellar mass M, as:

where G is the universal gravitational constant. The ra-

dius of centrifugal barrier rcp (where all kinetic energy
is converted into rotational motion) can hence be given

imensional dataset to match the C180 synthesized
beam with dimensions of 0”.31 x 0.28 (P.A. = —81°).
Then, we extracted the simulated PV diagrams along
he axis at P.A.= 60°. Further details regarding the
model derivation can be found in Appendix B.
In the PV diagram (Figure 11(a)), the largest velocity
ffsets appear at + ~0/1 from the central source. Due
o the limited angular resolution of ~0'3, the radius of
he centrifugal barrier is difficult to constrain. We there-
‘ore constructed the model PV diagrams with different
rcp and central stellar masses, and compared with the
observations. The angle of the disk normal is assumed
o be 35° from the plane of the sky, which is between
he axes of the outflow (~40°, see Section 4.3.1) and
he jet (~30°, see Section 4.4.1). The results are shown
in Figure 12. The models with small rcp, such as 10
and 20 au, reproduce the triangle structures of the blue
and red sides, while those with rcp = 60 au, the emis-
sion in the first and third quadrants disappears. Models
with Ry, = 10 — 40 au and M, = 0.08 — 0.1 Mo can
reasonably reproduce the observed PV diagram.

4.3. Outflow Configuration
4.3.1. CO Outflow Modeling

Following Lee et al. (2000) and Jhan et al. (2022), we
used the wide-angle wind-driven shell model, which as-
sumes that the outflow shell is parabolic and radially
expanding, to simultaneously fit the CO outflow PV di-
agram and its outer spatial boundaries in the moment
0 map. In this model, the structure and velocity of
the outflow shell can be described by the equations in
cylindrical coordinates, (z, R):

z=CR (13)
UR =vU0R (14)
Uz = Uz (15)

where C’ and vp are free parameters that describe the
curvature of the parabola near the base of the outflow
lobe and velocity distributions of the outflow shell, re-
spectively.

It should be noted that the inclination angles of the
outflow axes derived here are the ones at the bases of

mainly appears in the low velocity ranges, < + 6 km
s+ (see Figure A4), the inclination angles of the larger
scale outflow lobes could be smaller than those at the
bas

2S.
4.3.2. Physical Parameters of the outflow components

Using the procedure outlined in Yildiz et al. (2015),
we derived physical parameters such as the total mass,
momentum, outflow force, kinetic energy, and mechan-
ical power. Following Yildiz et al. (2015) and Dutta
et al. (2022), we assume an excitation temperature of
Tex = 50 K for the CO outflow and a fractional abun-
dance of CO to be Xco ~ 1074. We also assume an
LTE condition and that the CO emission is optically
thin. The inclination angles of the outflow axes were
assumed to be 40°. We summarize the derived physical
parameters of the outflows in Table 3.

4.4. High-velocity Molecular Jets
4.4.1. SiO Jets and the Shock-forming Model

To derive physical parameters of the SiO jets, we
adopt the shock-forming model proposed by Jhan et al.
(2022), which assumes that the internal shocks (so-called
“knots” ) were formed by the fastest material catching up
and colliding with the slowest material due to periodic
variations in the velocities of the jet ejections. We use
the model to derive the jet inclination angle i, the mean
jet velocity Vj, and the period of the variation P. These
can be related to observed quantities in the following
equations:

i = tan7!( (16)
We (17)
P= (18)

where Vops is the observed (projected) mean jet veloc-
ity, AVops is the observed velocity variation, Dops is the
observed distance between the first knot and the central
protostar, and ADgbs is the observed distance between
the first and second knots.

Figures 14(a) and (b) show the SiO PV diagrams cut
along the major axes of the redshifted and blueshifted
jets, respectively. The TM1l-only dataset was used in
order to spatially resolve the knots. In the PV diagram,
the three subknots in rl are not clearly separated; espe-
cially the presence of the rla knot is not clear. On the
other hand, the rlc is identified as a secondary peak at
Visr~ 35 km s~! with emission extending to > 40 km
s-!, Within the innermost knot pair, rlb and bib, an
increase in velocity is observed with increasing distance
from the central star. Such an apparent acceleration,
which is also observed at the base of the L1448C(N) jet
(Hirano et al. 2010; Yoshida et al. 2021), is different from

19

hat expected in the sideways ejection of the shocked
region. In the case of the L1448C (N) jet, Jhan et al.
(2022) argued that the first pair of knots is unlikely to be
‘ormed by shocks, because the velocity dispersion of >40
m s~! observed in these knots is too large for the SiO
o survive (e.g. Schilke et al. 1997; Gusdorf et al. 2008).
Although the velocity dispersions in rlb and blb, ~20
m s~!, being within the range of SiO to survive, we ex-
cluded rlb and blb from our analysis, and assumed that
he first knot pair produced by shock are rlc and ble.
By visually inspecting the PV diagrams, we estimated
Dovs and ADgops to be 0.54 + 0.1 and 0.36 + 0”.1,
respectively, for both jet components, where the uncer-
ainties were assumed to be the geometric mean of the
TM1 beam dimensions.
The radial velocity of the jet, as referenced in Vops,

was determined by performing Gaussian fits on the rep-
resentative spectral profiles at the specified knot posi-
ions of r2 and b2. The spectra corresponding to rlc and

ble were omitted due to their deviation from Gaussian
spectral shapes. The radial sideways-ejection velocity,
indicated as AVops, was evaluated using the line width
measured at a 3 a level of the line profiles at the knots
‘or r2 and ble. We derived Vops ~ +34.0 + 0.1 km s~!
and AVops ~ 12.0 km s~! for the redshifted jet and
Vops © —32.0 + 0.06 km s~! and AVops ~ 11.5 km s~?

derived the inclination angle, mean deprojected jet ve-
ocity, and period of velocity variation to be i ~ 31+12°,
V, ~ 66 £23 km s~!, and P ~ 11 +8 yr for the red-
shifted jet and i ~ 314 12°, V; ~ 63 + 22 km s~!, and
P~11+9 yr for the blueshifted jet. It should be noted
hat the current correlator configuration does not fully
cover the velocity range of the redshifted jet. There-
‘ore, the inclination angle of the redshifted jet could be
smaller if the full velocity dispersion is measured. As-

From these measurements, we

suming that the line profile at r2 knot is symmetric to
its peak velocity, AVops could be ~14.8 km s~!. In this
case, the inclination angle is estimated to be ~26°.

4.4.2. The Mass Loss Rate and CO/SiO Abundance

The CO column density in the jet was calculated us-
ing the Equation (9) assuming the LTE condition and
optically thin line emission. The CO excitation temper-

ature in the jet was assumed to be ~150 K following

Dutta et al. (2022). The moment

0 maps used were in-

tegrated over the velocity ranges of —37 < vops < —20

km s~! and 23.4 < vops < 38 km s~t.

The CO col-

umn densities averaged over the blueshifted and red-
shifted jets are ~ 2.5 x 10!° and ~ 2.7 x 10!° cm-?,
respectively. A mass-loss rate can be estimated from

the beam-averaged CO column

ensities by assuming a

where fy, = 2.8 is the mean molecular weight, my =
1.67 x 1074 g is the mass of a hydrogen atom, V; is
the mean deprojected jet velocity derived in Section
4.4.1. Since the transverse width of the jet, ~27 au,
is not resolved by the beam of the CO image (Figure
7a), we adopted the geometrical mean of the CO beam,
bm = V0".31 x 07.28 ~ 0’.3 (108 au), to be the jet
width. We assumed Xoo ~ 4 x 1074 (Glassgold et al.
1991), regarding this to be the upper limit as lower CO
abundances have been derived in some cases (e.g., Hi-
rano et al. 2010). From Equation (19), we derived the jet
mass-loss rates to be ~ (4.5 + 1.6) x 107° Mo yr7! and
~ (4.74 1.6) x 10-8 Mo yr7! for the blueshifted and
redshifted components, respectively. The derived to-
al mass-loss rate is thus ~ (9.2 + 3.2) x 1078 Mo yrot.
The mechanical powers of the blue- and redshifted jets
defined as L; = (1/2)xMjVj are ~1.5x10-?Lq and
~1.7 x10-?Lo, respectively.
power of the jet is ~ 3.1x107?Lo, which is ~ 5 times
arger than that of the outflow, ~6.2x1073Lo.

Similar to the CO analysis, we derived the mean SiO
column densities using Equation (9) to be ~ 2.5 x 1014
and ~ 1.8 x 104 cm~? for the blueshifted and redshifted
jets, respectively, from the TM1+TM2 data, under the
same assumptions of optical thin emission and LTE with
an excitation temperature of 150 K. The SiO0/CO abun-
dance values are ~ 4.3 x 10~° for the blueshifted jet and
~ 5.8 x 1079 for the redshifted jet. The Si0/CO abun-
dance in the first redshifted knot should be higher than
the estimated value because the CO emission is barely
seen in this knot despite the bright SiO emission from
the knot.

5. DISCUSSION
5.1. Evolutionary Phase of the Central Source

The highly collimated outflow with a deprojected ve-
locity of ~ 30 km s~? and the extremely high-velocity
(EHV) jet with V; ~ 65 km s~! indicate that the cen-
tral source of G204NE has already reached the protostel-
lar stage. Meanwhile, the continuum emission from the
central source is generally faint at wavelengths shorter
than 70 ym and exhibits a low bolometric temperature
of Tho. ~ 33 K. The SED of this source with a peak
around 160 jm resembles those of the first hydrostatic
core candidates compiled by Dutta et al. (2022), imply-
ing that the central star is in the early stage of Class 0
as in the case of G208Walma (Dutta et al. 2022). Our
analysis of the continuum visibility profile unveiled the

presence of a spatially compact circumstellar disk with
a radius of ~ 12 au, which also corroborates the sce-
nario that G204NE is in the nascent stage of the Class
0 phase. The collimated outflows with cavity angles of
~ 40° at their bases are also characteristic of an early
Class 0 source (e.g., Aso et al. 2017, 2018; Dutta et al.
2020). Furthermore, the chemical properties of G204NE
also support this interpretation. The C!8O emitting re-
gion is spatially compact with a radius of ~240 au, and
is surrounded by the spatially extended emission of the
deuterated molecules. This indicates that the central
protostar has just started heating its surrounding, and
that the bulk of the gas in the core remains colder than
the CO sublimation temperature. The C!8O abundance
toward the protostellar position is < 107°, which is one

order of magnitude lower than that of the interstellar kinematics is ~ 0.1 Mg. The stellar radius R, is as-

value. This is in part because the bulk of the envelope
gas along the line of sight is colder than the CO sub-
limation temperature of ~ 25 K, except for the close
vicinity of the central source. Another possibility is the
grain surface chemistry. During the prestellar phase,
CO on the grain surface decreases due to the conver-
sion into more complex molecules such as CH3OH (e.g.,
Alonso-Albi et al. 2010; Fuente et al. 2012). Meanwhile,
the drop in N2D+ abundance toward the center suggest
the evaporation of CO from the dust and the reaction
between N2D* and the CO gas to form DCO?*.

5.2. Mass Accretion and Ejection

The mass accretion rate Macc can be estimated using

the bolometric luminosity L},.1 and the protostellar mass
M,:

Here, we assume that the bolometric luminosity of the
central protostar ~1.15 Lo originates entirely from mass
accretion. The mechanical luminosities of the jet and
outflow, 0.03 Le and 0.006 Lo, respectively, are not
taken into account because they are negligible as com-
pared to the bolometric luminosity. The mass of the
central star M, derived in Section 4.2 from the envelope

Mace Moyr™t. (20)

sumed to be ~2Ro (Stahler 1988). The mass accretion
rate derived from Equation (20) is Mace~7.3X1077 Mo
yrot,

The ratio of Myet/ Mace becomes ~0.13. This value is
consistent with the Mje¢/ Macc ratio for the Class 0/1 jets
in the literature (Lee et al. 2000; Ellerbroek et al. 2013).
The Myet./ Mace ratio enable us to estimate the footpoint
radius of the jet following the method described in Lee
(2020). The Myet/ Mace ratio is related to the magnetic
lever arm parameter Ay (e.g., Pudritz et al. 2007),

In the case of G204NE, the mass of the central star, the
mean velocity of the jet, and the magnetic lever arm
parameters are ~0.1 Mo, ~65 km s~!, and ~8.0, re-
spectively. Using these parameters, the footpoint radius
calculated from Equation (23) is ~ 0.28 au.

The footpoint radius of the jet derived here is
within twice of the dust sublimation radius of
Reub ~ 0.15 \/Lpoi/Lo (Yvart et al. 2016) ~0.16 au.
This implies that the jet could be launched from the
outer edge of the dust sublimation zone. A comparison
of the measured SiO/CO abundance ratio and jet mass
loss rate, ~5x107? and ~1.2x10-7 Mo, respectively,
with the chemical models of the jet with different dust-
to-gas mass ratios by Tabone et al. (2020, their Figure
12) suggests that the jet contains small amount of dust
(a few percent of the canonical ISM value).

5.3. Origin of Multiple Outflow Components

As shown in Figure 5, the tips of the northern and
southern lobes exhibit a pair of bow-like patterns, im-
plying that each lobe consists of two lobes with slightly
different position angles. As summarized in Table 4,
the axes of the two lobes are ~—5° (NE lobe) and ~—20°
(NW lobe) in the northern lobe, and ~190° (SE lobe)
and ~205° (SW lobe) in the southern lobe. The veloc-
ity asymmetry observed in the northern lobe—i.e., the
lower velocity in the eastern wall and the higher veloc-
ity in the western wall—is naturally explained if the NE
and NW lobes have different inclination angles; the NE
lobe having a smaller inclination angle with respect to
the plane of the sky contributes to the emission of the
eastern wall, and the NW lobe with larger inclination
angle contributes to the emission of the western wall. In
the southern lobe, the axis of the SW lobe is close to
the plane of the sky, and that of the SE lobe is more in-
clined. The SW lobe is likely the redshifted counterpart
of the NE lobe, while the SE lobe is likely the counter-
part of the NW lobe. Outflow systems with multiple
lobe pairs with different orientations are also observed
in the early Class 0 protostars such as HOPS 373SW
(Lee et al. 2024).

A possible explanation for the two pairs of lobes is
an embedded system of close binary protostars, each of
which is driving a bipolar outflow. Although the cen-
tral source of G204NE does not show a signature of bi-
nary down to the scale of ~ 18 au, embedded binary
with a separation smaller than this scale cannot be
excluded. A three-dimensional magnetohydromagnetic
(MHD) simulation by Saiki & Machida (2020) has re-
vealed that the close binary system with a separation
of < 30 au can be formed by means of fragmentation of
the collapsing core. Each protostar in this binary sys-

23

em is launching a highly-collimated outflow/jet. Since
he axes of the outflows/jets are distorted due to the
orbital motion of the launching points, the misaligned
outflows/jets can be naturally formed. In this scenario,
he EHV jet observed in CO, SO, and SiO is driven
by one of the binary protostars, the mass accretion to-
ward which is currently active. As discussed in Saiki
& Machida (2020), the twin outflows/jets can be de-
ectable only in the region close to the protostars where
he outflows/jets are not significantly disturbed by the
orbital motion of the binary. In the outer region, the
wo outflows/jets are difficult to recognize because the
outflows/jets are highly tangled. In the case of the bi-
nary system with a separation of a and the total mass
of Mtot, the orbital period P is given by

P = (40703 / @Miot)!/?. (24)

For the putative binary system having a separation of ~
18 au and a total mass of ~0.1 Mo, the orbital period P
is calculated to be ~ 240 yr. The orbital period is even
shorter for the binary with a smaller separation. As-
suming that the maximum radial velocity of the outflow
is ~20 km s~! and the inclination angle from the plane
of the sky is ~ 40°, the outflow can reach ~ 1200 au in
one orbital period. Thus, the twin outflows/jets could
be detectable only in the region much smaller than ~
1200 au. This implies that the observed twin bow-shock
structures located at ~4100 au from the central source
are unlikely to be attributed to the twin outflows/jets
rom the close binary protostars.

Another possible scenario is that the two pairs of lobes
and an EHV jet are driven by a single protostar. In the
urbulent core, the angular momentum distribution is
non-uniform. The orientation of the disk formed in such

an environment is expected to be time-variable due to
he accretion of the gas with nonuniform angular mo-
mentum. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced
in the youngest protostars such as G204NE, whose disk
mass is notably small. Assuming that the S-shaped fea-
ure observed in dust continuum (Figure 4) is feeding
he material to the disk, the reorientation of the angu-
ar momentum of the disk can be estimated following
he method of Goddi et al. (2020). The total angular
momentum of the Keplerian rotating disk around the
central star with M,is estimated as

laisk = 0.4 Maisk VGM,Raisk 5 (25)

where Maisk and Raisk are the mass and radius of the
disk. The total angular momentum of the disk with a
radius of 12 au and a mass of 0.015 Mo rotating around
the central star of ~0.1 Mg is calculated to be lgisk ~ 5.8
x 10°° g cm? s~. If half of the mass of the S-shaped
24

feature, ~0.005 Me impact the disk at r = 12 au with
a free-fall velocity, Ving_vertical = 3.8 km s~1, the angular
momentum of the falling gas is lgump~ 5.3 x 10°° sin
w gem? s~!. Here, 7 represents the angle between the
gas trajectory and the plane of the disk. Since the C50
emission is blueshifted toward the position of the north-
ern arm and redshifted in the southern arm, the angle
between the arms and disk, y, should be <55°, because
the disk is is inclined by ~65° from the plane of the sky.
Assuming that y is ~50°, the angular momentum of
the disk is reoriented by 6 = tan! (laump /ldisk) ~ 42°
Given that the difference in position angle between the
NE (SE) and NW (SW) lobes projected onto the plane
of the sky is 15°, the alteration in the disk’s angular
momentum is sufficient to account for the reorientation

observed in the outflow directions.

Moreover, the misalignment between angular momen-
tum and the magnetic field is also of significant impor-
tance; three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
simulations conducted by Hirano & Machida (2019) and
Machida et al. (2020) have demonstrated that if the ini-
tial angular momentum of the collapsing core is mis-
aligned with the global magnetic field, the directions of
the outflows fluctuate randomly over time. Their mod-
els also show that the different velocity components of
outflows/jets are ejected to the different directions due
to the warped disk/pseudodisk structure. This can also
explains why the axes of the EHV jets are different from
those of the larger scale outflow lobes. The local mis-
alignment between angular momentum and magnetic
field occurs naturally in the turbulent core, in which
angular momentum of the infalling material randomly
changes with time and the magnetic field lines are in-
clined with respect to the initial direction (Matsumoto
et al. 2017).

5.4. Possible Mechanisms of outflow/jet deflection

As shown in Figures 5 and 7, the orientations of the
blue- and red-shifted components of the two pairs of
outflows, as well as the jet, do not exhibit antiparallel
alignment. The axes of each three pairs are misaligned
by ~30°. Similar outflows with deflected lobes have been
observed in several protostars (e.g., Ching et al. 2016;
Tobin et al. 2016; Aso et al. 2017; Yen et al. 2017; Aso
et al. 2018). Four possible mechanisms could explain the
formation of deflected outflows: (1) orbital motion of the
inary protostar (Fendt & Zinnecker 1998; Masciadri &
Raga 2002), (2) dynamical interaction with the dense
gas (Fendt & Zinnecker 1998; Umemoto et al. 1991),
(3) Lorentz forces between the external magnetic field
and the current in the outflow lobe (Fendt & Zinnecker

1998), and (4) turbulent accretion in moderately magne-
tized core (Matsumoto et al. 2017; Takaishi et al. 2024).

The first mechanism involving binary orbital motion is
unlikely, as the central star of G204NE lacks the signa-
ture of binary. It is also unlikely that the central star is a
close binary system unresolved by the current resolution
of ~ 18 au, because the orbital motion of the close binary
system produces a mirror symmetric wiggling pattern
(e.g., Masciadri & Raga 2002) rather than inducing de-
flection. In the second mechanism of dynamical interac-
tion, as outflows propagate and encounter varying den-
sities and gas compositions within the dense molecular
cloud surrounding the central protostar, these inhomo-
geneities can cause the outflow trajectory to bend (Fend
& Zinnecker 1998; Umemoto et al. 1991). A close-up
view of the redshifted lobe (Figure 13(a)) exhibits tha:
the eastern wall of the redshifted lobe changes its direc-
tion at ~25 south of the central source where the brigh
emission spot is observed. Since the dense ambient gas
traced by NoD+ and DCO* extends to the southeas
of the central source (dashed ellipse in Figure 4(c) and
(e)), the interaction with this component could bend the
direction of the flow to the southwest. The moment
image of DCO+ (Figure 15(a)) shows that the redshifted
emission is extending from southeast to southwest of the
southern lobe. However, this redshifted DCOt emission
does not extend to the deflection point; the ambient
gas traced by the DCO? emission near the deflection
point is blueshiftd rather than redshifted. Therefore,
the outflow deflection is unlikely to be attributed to the
interaction with the dense ambient gas. The observed
eflection is likely to be due to the interaction between
he jet and outflow. As shown in Figure 15(b), the de-
flection point corresponds to the location at which the
jet impacts on the eastern wall of the redshifted lobe.

The deflected structure can also be formed by the
Lorentz force if the poloidal current in the jet/outflow
and the counter jet/outflow flow the same direction
(Fendt & Zinnecker 1998). While the typical interstel-
lar magnetic field of a few tens of microgauss is not
strong enough to bend the jet/outflow, the magnetic
field associated with one outflow functions as the ex-
ternal magnetic field for an adjacent outflow lobe. This
mechanism of electromagnetic interaction between adja-
cent lobes was examined to explain the similar deflected
outflow in the protobinary system NGC1333 IRAS 4A
(Ching et al. 2016) and Serpens SMM4 (Aso et al. 2018).
Given that G204NE exhibits a pair of outflow lobes, it
is plausible that the same mechanism could account for
the deflection observed in this system. The strength of
the magnetic field B that is required to deflect the out-
flow/jet by @ can be derived utilizing the subsequent

where i,, v’, and L’ are the inclination angle, observed
line-of-sight velocity, and projected length of the out-
flow lobe/jet, respectively (Aso et al. 2018). The de-
flection angle a corresponds to half of the misalignment
of the axes, i.e. ~15°. If we adopt (¢, ip, v’, L’) to be
(15°, 25°, 20 km s~!, 4140 au), the required magnetic
field strength would be B ~ 150 wG. Stronger magnetic
field is required to bend the jet with higher velocity and
shorter length; adopting (4, ip, v’, L’) for the jet to be
(15°, 22°, 35 km s~1, 800 au), the required magnetic
field strength is estimated to be ~1.5 mG. Given that
the magnetic field strength observed in typical protostel-
lar envelopes is on the order of a few mG (Girart et al.
2006; Hull et al. 2017; Aso et al. 2021), it is plausible
to quantitatively attribute the deflection mechanisms to
the influence of the Lorentz force.

As observed with the outflow in Serpens SMM4B (Aso
et al. 2018), the deflection of the outflow lobes and jet
in G204NE appear in proximity to the central star. Aso
et al. (2018) suggested the possibility that the deflec-
tion of the outflow lobe might be attributed to disk-scale
structures. MHD simulations incorporating turbulence

have demonstrated that misaligned outflow lobes can de-
velop within a turbulent core where the magnetic field
geometry is disturbed due to turbulence (Matsumoto

et al. 2017; Takaishi et al. 2024). The outflows prop-

agate in the average direction of the

magnetic field at

that scale, resulting in the formation of an outflow lobe

and counter-lobe that are not antipara

lel. The deflected

outflow has been successfully reproduced in the MHD
simulation of the moderately magnetized turbulent core
(Takaishi et al. 2024). In turbulent accretion models,
the density distributions in the infalling envelope ex-
hibit arc-like or spiral structures (Matsumoto et al. 2017;
Takaishi et al. 2024), which is similar to the S-sped pat-
tern seen in the TM1+TM2 continuum image (Figure 4).
Additionally, the turbulent accretion model is consistent
with the interpretation of the multiple pairs of lobes and
the jets exhibiting varying orientations, as discussed in
the previous section.

6. CONCLUSIONS

We have observed the molecular cloud core G204NE
in the Orion B GMC with ALMA in Band 6. The phys-
ical and chemical characteristics of the structural com-
ponents, the dense gas tracers, the outflow/jets, and the
envelope kinematics have been investigated. Our main
results are summarized below:

rived from the SED analysis are T;,,) ~ 33 K and
Lo. ~ 1.15 Lo, respectively, suggesting that this
core harbor a low luminosity Class 0 protostar.

2. The continuum images of TM1 CLEAN ~28 au
resolution and SpM ~18 au resolution reveal a
compact central structure. There is no clear signa-
ture of binary down to the resolution of ~18 au.
The TM1+TM2 continuum map shows a spiral-
like distribution surrounding the central protostar.
The continuum visibility profile suggests the pres-
ence of three components with distinct size scales,
including an extremely compact circumstellar disk
with a radius of ~ 12 au.

3. Significant chemical stratification is exhibited by
the dense gas tracers C180, NoDt, and DCO?*.

5. The collimated outflow is traced by the CO,

consists of two lobes with slightly different posi-
ion angles. The inclination angle of the outflow
axes, as determined by the wide-opening angle
wind model, is ~ 40° from the plane of the sky

envelope and inner disk are rotating and infalling. Cartesian coordinates within the envelope-disk system are adopted
with the x-axis along the projected major axis of the envelope, the y-axis along the line of sight, and the z-axis
orthogonal to both the x- and y-axes. The origin is defined as the center of the envelope.

We define the deprojected coordinates of (X, Y, Z) as (X’, Y’, Z’). The relationship between the coordinates is
given by:

X'’=X, Y'’=Ycosi—-Zsini, Z’ =Ysini+Zcosi (B1)

vine = |[vine|(cos 6 cos @ x! + cosOsing y! — sin 6 2’) (B10)

where z! = (0, sint, —cosi). Projecting the infall velocity onto the line of sight gives:

vies = |vine|(cos sin d cosi — sin @ sin?) (B11)

The observed intensity S,, is assumed to be proportional to the column density. We suppose that the disk surface
density follows a power law with respect to rcen. In this paper, we assumed an exponent of p = —1.5 (i.e., Ux Rg).
Inside the centrifugal barrier, we cap the surface density to tou" to avoid dividing by zero. If the following conditions
due to the geometric boundaries are not satisfied, zero surface density is assigned to that coordinate:

1. Teen(X, ¥,Z) < renv and Prep =

sin-1(| 2 |)| < 90° — % if ra, < rep
2. |Z'| < Ro cot feo if tax > TOR

We then calculated the intensities in the simulated three-dimensional (two spatial, one spectral) data cube by inte-
erating along the line of sight with steps of the velocity resolution Av = 0.1 km s~!. On each simulated channel map,
values enclosed by pixels with size 0.04 were averaged. Gaussian convolution was performed on each modeled channel
map to simulate the C!8O beam size (see Table 1). From the simulated data cube, the position-velocity diagrams were
then extracted along the projected major and minor axes.
