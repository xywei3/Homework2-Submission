Recent laboratory experimental work has suggested that heating and cooling processes
may exhibit intrinsic asymmetry, with heating occurring more efficiently than cooling.
Two decades earlier, molecular dynamics simulations addressed the topic of heating one
side of a computational cell while cooling the other side by applying two different ther-
mostats. We revisit those computer calculations, recapitulating the underlying theory, and
showing how we might have been able to predict the lab results from tantalizing partial
MD results. Recent realizations of a simple two-dimensional one-particle cell model gave
surprisingly relevant results, by thermostatting the two directions (x and y) at two different
temperatures: at equilibrium, the thermostatting variables in each direction were identical,
while under nonequilibrium temperature differences, the heating variable was weaker than
the cooling one. At the same time, MD simulations from four decades ago by Evans and
Holian piqued our curiosity, since they had reported a surprising skew in the Nosé—Hoover
thermostat variable € under equilibrium conditions — indicating a statistical bias in energy
injection versus extraction. In this study, we revisit those results using modern MD simula-
tions of a Lennard-Jones soft-sphere fluid with exact reproduction of their setup. We show
that when (1) center-of-mass velocity is set to zero, (2) the equations of motion are care-
fully integrated by finite central differencing, and (3) sampling time is sufficiently long, the
distribution of € is symmetric and Gaussian with zero mean, as predicted by theory and
convincingly validated by error estimates using two approaches. We then demonstrate clear
asymmetry in the distribution of both thermostat variables for the simple cell model: the
cold bath requires significantly stronger damping than the hot bath requires anti-damping
— matching an exact analytic relation (&,) /(€,) = —T,/T;, linking thermostat effort to ther-
mal bias and showing how this is related to the negative rate of change in the entropy of
the system, accompanying the contraction of phase space onto a fractal strange attractor
of lower dimension. Our results clearly identify the microscopic origin of heating—cooling
asymmetry as a genuine nonequilibrium effect, thereby strongly confirming the results of

laboratory experiments.
I. INTRODUCTION

“C’est la dissymétrie qui crée le phénoméne.”
(It is the asymmetry that creates the phenomenon.)

-Pierre Curie, Journal de Physique 3, 393 (1894)

The laws of thermodynamics are generally assumed to treat heating and cooling on equal foot-
ing. Microscopic time-reversibility implies that energy can, in principle, be injected or removed
with equivalent ease, subject only to fluctuations. Yet recent experiments have cast doubt on this
intuitive symmetry. Ibdfiez et al.! demonstrated that heating a system occurs more efficiently —

faster and with less dissipation — than cooling the same system by the same amount.

The Ibdfiez et al. heating and cooling experiments! were conducted on colloidal particles (silica
microspheres of diameter one micrometer) with charged surfaces, suspended in water, confined by
a near-infrared laser trap, and subjected to a heat bath produced by a white noise electric field.
Particle Brownian motion was tracked by laser scattering for three temperature quench protocols,
i.e., relaxation between either a higher temperature or lower to an intermediate target temperature,
then the reverse procedure starting from equilibration at the target temperature, and finally, either
heating or cooling between only two temperatures. In all cases, heating is seen to be more easily
accomplished than cooling when a nonequilibrium temperature difference exists; otherwise, at
equilibrium, there is no bias. This nonequilibrium asymmetry raises important questions: Is the
asymmetry in heating and cooling a purely macroscopic effect? Or does it emerge naturally at the

microscopic scale?

One of us (BLH) recalled, upon seeing the Ibdfiez results, that Evans and Holian2, in a 1985
molecular-dynamics (MD) computer simulation of a Nosé—-Hoover (NH) thermostatted fluid, ob-
served a similar asymmetry favoring heating — but at equilibrium! The NH thermostat? modifies
the atomistic Newtonian equations of motion by introducing an integral feedback term (the nega-
tive of a thermostatting-rate variable & times particle velocity) into the momentum rate of change.
The Nosé—Hoover thermostat behaves like a heat bath, represented by &, an additional phase-space
degree of freedom outside the normal particle degrees of freedom (coordinates and momenta).
When the thermostat coefficient & is positive, the thermostat heat bath takes energy out of all par-
ticles by slowing them down (frictional); when & is negative, the thermostat pumps energy into
the particles, speeding them up (anti-frictional); at equilibrium, & fluctuates around zero. NH ther-

mostatting at equilibrium makes the fluid behave as though it were sampling the NVT canonical
ensemble (N particles in volume V and temperature T). The asymmetry observed? in the distribu-
tion of €, skewed toward negative values (favoring heating), were considered remarkable, since
theory predicts a zero mean.

By Fourier’s Law, heat flows irreversibly "downhill" from a hot temperature 7; to a cold tem-
perature Jy with T; > 7p. We have just recently studied the two-dimensional single-particle cell
model*, where a wanderer particle moves in a periodic box with confinement provided by repulsive
“mounds” at the four corners, and temperature in the two directions are orthogonally thermostatted
by Nosé—Hoover: one direction hot (x) at temperature 7; = T, and one cold (y) at Ty = T,. This cell
model displayed the same asymmetry in the Lyapunov spectrum under nonequilibrium conditions
as it does for the two thermostatting coefficients, €o and &), but no sign of asymmetry at all when
T, = T,. Thus, we were prompted by these results to revisit the Evans and Holian equilibrium MD
simulation, to see if modern MD could confirm the old apparent asymmetry.

In 2002, a many-body nonequilibrium molecular-dynamics (NEMD) simulation of heat flow?
was inspired by an imaginary thought experiment: a Maxwell Demon separates a hot reservoir at
temperature TY) (steady-state average is T; > To) from a cold sample at temperature TO (steady-
state average is 7p), using an invisible wall; sample and reservoir particles interact across the
boundary at x = 0 by terms in the total potential energy ®. Particles can move freely between the
two sides and are subject to periodic boundary conditions (PBC). The Demon applies two Nosé—
Hoover thermostats: for any sample particle at x < 0, the rate is 9 , whose long-time average is
positive, so as to extract heat from the cold sample; for any reservoir particle at x > 0, the rate is
&1, whose long-time average is negative, so as to pump heat into the hot reservoir. Let us assume
that there are an equal number of particles, N on average, in both the hot reservoir and cold
sample. Of course, the temperature profile smoothes out to become approximately sinusoidal,
which allows the resulting simulation, with decreasing temperature difference, to be analyzed
by Navier-Stokes—Fourier hydrodynamics to yield the thermal conductivity at the Green-Kubo
(equilibrium) limit. (Similarly, shear viscosity can be obtained from a system where one side has
a fluid velocity in the y-direction imposed by a fluctuating acceleration, while the other has the
opposite driving; in this case, only one NH thermostat keeps the temperature constant on both
sides; it’s the velocity profile that smoothes out to be nearly sinusoidal.)

The example chosen for NEMD in Ref.> was an extreme case of heat flow, namely, a cold solid
next to a hot fluid, with a melted interface. The resulting fluid thermal conductivity at the interface

was somewhat higher than the Green—Kubo limit, but not by much. The steady-state positive

4
value of & for the cold sample was reported; unfortunately, the paper gave no clue about the
magnitude of the negative coefficient for pumping heat into the hot side — a missed opportunity!
Nevertheless, this Demonic NEMD thought experiment allows us to make some general arguments
about the entropic origin of the asymmetry of nonequilibrium heating versus cooling.

Focusing on one side or the other of the Maxwell Demon system, the volume V contains V
atoms, characterized by the flow velocity of the center-of-mass (CM). Subtracting out that CM

velocity results in what is called the "peculiar" (or "thermal") velocity for each particle.

dW /dt, for the NH thermostatted computational box, where Q is the heat injected into the system

from the thermostat heat bath, and W is the work done by the system on its surroundings (e.g.,

5
work done to shear the fluid, or lift a weight, or change pressure or volume, etc.). From this, we

can find the rate of change in the entropy, S, namely, dS/dt.

The NVT temperature fluctuation of /To = [2/(3N)]!/? is derived in Appendix A (as in Ref.°).
The equations of motion (with initial CM velocity = 0) can be integrated by Stgrmer finite centered
differences, where coordinates and the heat-flow variable are evaluated at integral values of the
time step (as are forces, which depend on coordinates) while velocities are staggered by half time
steps (as is the temperature). These centered difference equations of motion are time-reversible
and avoid introducing center-of-mass drift errors, as well as systematic time-step errors (see details
in Appendix B).

At equilibrium, long-time averages are equivalent to ensemble averages; for the nonequilibrium
steady state (NESS), time averages are the whole game. (For the Gaussian distribution of the
thermostatting coefficient and its number-dependence, see Appendix A)

Now, we are prepared to take these foundational concepts of NH thermostatting and general-
ize them to the two-state nonequilibrium heat-flow problem addressed by the Maxwell Demon’.
NESS long-time averages of temperature, energy, and entropy are related to long-time averages of

the two thermostat variables:
(E) = —3Nk(To) (G0) — 3NK(Ti) (61) = —3NKTp (G0) — 3NKT; (61) (23)

(8) = (S0) + ($1) = —3NK[(Eo) + (61)]
= 3Nk (£0) (4,*) <0, Q7)

which means the phase space contracts and its dimension becomes less than 6N + | for both sample
and reservoir.

Clearly, the entropy never becomes steady, but drops forever as the phase-space distribution
collapses onto a fractal strange attractor of lower dimensionality. The hot thermostat variable’s
long-time average is smaller in magnitude than the cold (|&;| < ), by virtue of the conservation
of energy. From the equation for the rate of entropy change in the combined system (hot and
cold), we see that entropy continues to get more and more negative in steady-state heat flow,
which thereby demonstrates conclusively that it is easier to heat a sample than to cool it. (An
alternative derivation of this nonequilibrium behavior of the entropy rate of change can be gotten
from the Liouville continuity equation for the phase-space distribution function; see Appendix C)

The relationship of these NEMD heat-flow simulations to the Ibafiez lab experiments is clear,

though the data from the NEMD thermostatting coefficients might have an analogue in steady-state

7
laboratory experiments: if the experimental power required to keep the two temperature regions at
their respective temperatures were measured, they might show a bias similar to the absolute value
of the NEMD thermostatting coefficients.

The heat flow results of NEMD in a three-dimensional multi-particle NH thermostatted fluid
can be compared to a much simpler two-dimensional model of a single particle moving in a peri-
odic cell, with temperature in the two directions thermostatted — one direction hot (x) at tempera-
ture T; = T, and one cold (y) at Jy = T,.The statistical mechanics analysis presented here for both
2D N = 1 and 3D N >> 1| computer simulations give identical predictions about entropy rate and

ease of heating compared to cooling.

Il. RESULTS
A. Revisiting Evans—Holian Results on the €-distribution at Equilibrium: Asymmetry?

Reflecting upon the Maxwell Demon hot-and-cold simulations and considering the striking
findings of asymmetry at equilibrium by Evans and Holian”, as well as thinking about the lessons
learned from the simple cell model, where the equilibrium distribution of the thermostatting coef-
ficient was perfectly symmetric and Gaussian, we thought it would be important to do a mod-
ern MD simulation, under Nosé—Hoover dynamics, of a fluid of N = 32 particles interacting
by the Lennard-Jones (LJ) soft-sphere potential @(r) = 4e (*) ° with cutoff r. = 1.50 (where
é€ is the depth of energy well for the full Lennard-Jones potential, and o is its vdW radius or
zero-energy crossing point) . We repeated their trajectory of length t = 120 (in LJ units, where
€=o0=m=k=1), using a time-step At = 0.003 and thermostat relaxation (or collision) time
tT = 0.09622. Moreover, we did extended simulations in both trajectory length and system size:
N=32, t=1.2x 10°, At =0.003 (small system, longer trajectory); N = 1000, t = 1.2 10°, At=
0.001 (large system, longer trajectory).

Why re-do this old work? We needed to assure ourselves that the earlier work did not have
some kind of systematic error, either some kind of inaccuracy in the integration of the equations
of motion, or possible failure to maintain zero CM velocity, or the possible existence of finite
system-size effects, or too short sampling times along the trajectory. We needed to perform the
thermostat variable’s distribution and assess for ourselves the error bars, by doing the error analysis

in two different ways. Hence, the old and new system sizes and trajectory lengths, not to mention

8
careful centered-difference integration of the Nosé—Hoover thermostatting equations of motion,
were deemed to be necessary for a definitive test of asymmetry — or not — at equilibrium.

To overlay data from larger systems, we rescale the horizontal axis of the thermostat distribution
for N = 1000 by a factor of ,/1000/32 5.6, such that all curves can be meaningfully plotted
together. This scaling arises from the Gaussian distribution of the variance of € : (E*) = 1/(3Nt7)
(see Appendix A). Figure 1 shows the probability distributions P(€) for all three cases. In the short
trajectory that reproduces their original setup, the distribution appears Gaussian and centered at
(E) =0, in contrast to the skewed histogram reported in Figure 1 (Ref.7). We also confirmed
that extending the trajectory length does not introduce any bias in (€). Both long simulations,
with N = 32 and N = 1000, show symmetric, zero-mean Gaussian distributions. We also overlay
the theoretical Gaussian curve corresponding to € ~ .V (0, Gz). The good agreement between the
histograms and the theoretical curve confirms that the friction coefficient, €, behaves as a Gaussian
random variable at equilibrium. For a discussion of our two methods of error estimation in MD
simulations, see Appendix D.

In our implementation, the Nosé—Hoover thermostat acts only on the particles’ peculiar ve-
locities, ensuring zero initial CM velocity remains zero. The original 1985 setup may not have
enforced this constraint correctly, nor can we be sure that the Stgrmer integration was done like
Appendix B, so that slight asymmetries might have been introduced into their results. We empha-
size that enforcing CM conservation and Stgrmer finite difference ensures proper sampling within

the NH thermostatted ensemble.

B. Nonequilibrium Asymmetry in the Thermostatted Two-Temperature Cell Model

To investigate the statistical behavior of Nosé—Hoover thermostats under nonequilibrium con-
ditions, we used the results of our recent study of a two-dimensional cell model with independent
thermostats* applied along the x and y directions. The extended thermostat variables &, and ey
are tracked in both equilibrium and NESS. Figure 2 shows the histograms of and &, for two
cases, equilibrium: T, = T, = 0.5 (6 = T; — Ty = 0.0), and nonequilibrium: T, = 0.5, T, = 0.05

(6 = 0.45). In equilibrium, both thermostat variables are symmetrically distributed around zero
with negligible skewness, as expected from time-reversible dynamics. Under nonequilibrium con-
ditions, the distributions become highly asymmetric, with clear shifts in the mean and median

values. These results are shown in Table I.

FIG. 2. Distributions of €, and &, in the two-temperature cell model. In equilibrium (6 = 0), both variables
are centered around zero. Under nonequilibrium conditions (6 = 0.45), the thermostat variables develop
strong asymmetry. The cold bath requires significantly stronger damping effort (€, >> &,) to maintain the

steady-state energy flow.

reflects the imposed thermal gradient: heat flows from the hot direction (x) to the cold direction (y),
and the thermostats respond accordingly. Interestingly, the thermostat effort is highly asymmetric,
explained analytically by the balance equation for steady-state energy input and output, outlined
in our Maxwell Demon scenario.

The thermostat along the cold direction (y) must apply an order-of-magnitude stronger damp-
ing force to absorb the incoming energy flux, while the hot direction (x) requires only mild anti-
damping to inject energy. The results obtained here are in good agreement with both equilibrium
and nonequilibrium cases of the many-body simulations as substantiated by the statistical mechan-
ical arguments we present in this paper. Thus, the heating is easier to accomplish than cooling,

confirming at the atomistic level the lab experimental results of Ibéfiez et al.!.

I. CONCLUSION

We have demonstrated at the microscopic scale, by many-body molecular dynamics computer
experiments and a very simple, but incredibly instructive single-particle two-dimensional cell
model‘, that true asymmetry between heating and cooling arises not in equilibrium, but in driven
nonequilibrium steady states. The theory that allows us to quantify the rates was first outlined in
earlier MD simulations of thermostatted side-by-side hot-and-cold regions». By itself, this theory
should have alerted us, two decades ago, to the inescapable fact of nonequilibrium heating/cooling
asymmetry.

Prompted by lab experiments on asymmetric heating and cooling rates! we have revisited and
resolved a discrepancy in the statistical behavior of the Nosé—Hoover thermostat first reported
by Evans and Holian in 1985. While their original equilibrium simulations appeared to show a

skewed distribution for the thermostat variable €, our modern simulation under identical initial

11
conditions included correct treatment of center-of-mass velocity, careful finite-difference integra-
tion of the equations of motion, and long-time sampling. The results reveal that the thermostat rate
variable exhibits a totally symmetric Gaussian distribution, in agreement with equilibrium theory.
We validated the mean-zero character of the distribution using two independent error estimation
methods. We emphasize that symmetry is an equilibrium property.

In a two-temperature Nosé—Hoover one-particle cell model* with T, > T,, that is, nonequilib-
rium conditions, the mean thermostat variables become asymmetric, depending on the degree of
deviation from linear response theory: we find that (€,) can become up to an order of magnitude
larger than (&,), matching the imposed temperature ratio. This asymmetry is explained analytically
by a steady-state energy balance, leading to the relation (&,) /(&)) = —T,,/Ty.

Together, these findings clarify the nonequilibrium conditions under which thermostat asymme-
try emerges and offer a microscopic explanation for recent experimental observations of unequal
heating and cooling rates!. We have shown that Nosé—Hoover friction variables not only regulate
energy exchange but also encode the thermodynamic structure of nonequilibrium states, including
the chaotic phase-space contraction to a lower-dimensional, fractal, strange attractor. Moreover,
our computer experiments have demonstrated relevance to real-world lab experiments. As a wise
old cowboy once said, "When you’re riding your horse, always be prepared for the unexpected."

We observe that the same applies to nonequilibrium systems.

Appendix A: Derivation of NVT Thermal Fluctuation

In this Appendix, we derive the canonical temperature fluctuation under Nosé-Hoover ther-
mostatting. The NVT equilibrium canonical ensemble (N particles in volume V, and temperature
T) is characterized by the phase-space distribution function p(I) at the 6N + 1 dimensional phase
point Il’ = {x,y, €} which is the collection of 3N coordinates x, 3N momenta p, and the NH thermo-
stat heat-flow variable €: p(I’) = exp(—BE)/Qnvr, where B = 1/kTp, k is Boltzmann’s constant,

To is the canonical-ensemble temperature set by the NH thermostat, E = K+ 0+ Ez, is the total

12
energy in the exponential Boltzmann factor the usual internal energy — the usual internal energy,
kinetic K and potential ®, plus a harmonic thermostat energy, Ez = 3 /2 NkTpt7?, representing
the NH heat bath®, and Qyyr is the canonical partition function, the integral of the Boltzmann
factor over all of phase space. Since p(I’) = 1/Q, where Q is the number of microstates for the
system at I, the entropy of the system is $ = —kInp = kInQ (Boltzmann’s epitaph on his tomb in

Vienna).

We can define the dimensionless thermostat strength, characterizing the exchange of energy
between the NH heat bath and the N sample particles, as € = €t, where € is the thermostatting
rate variable and & is the thermostat relaxation time (most efficiently chosen as the collision time).
Then, the harmonic heat-bath "potential" is Ez = (1/2)«¢ ? where K = 3NkTh is the "force con-
stant" or "stiffness" of the thermostatting potential well. If either ¢ > 0 (so that friction takes
kinetic energy out of the 3N particle momenta by slowing them down) or if € < 0 (so that anti-
friction pumps energy into the momenta, speeding them up) — in either case — there is an energetic
penalty for thermostatting added to the 6N + 1-dimensional total energy of system. The phase-
space distribution function contribution from the NH heat bath € ends up being a simple Gaussian:
exp (—BE¢) =exp(—3N¢E 2/2), whereby the variance of the dimensionless thermostatting strength
is (¢) = 1/(3N). Hence, the ensemble average (or time average) is (Eg) = (1/2) (6?) = kT/2,
which is a factor of 3N smaller than the particle momentum contribution to the kinetic energy:
(K) = 3N(kTIo/2). For a monatomic harmonic crystalline solid, (®) = (K) so that each of the
3N normal modes has a contribution from the particle coordinates of kTp/2, equal to that of the

momenta; for the ideal gas, = 0; monatomic fluids fall in between these two idealized limits.

The whole idea of thermostatting is to approach the NVT thermodynamic limit long before N

becomes infinite, at which point, the NH thermostat contributes nothing to the system.

Finally, the temperature (thermal) fluctuation, OF, is obtained by noticing that the phase space

can be separated into independent partition functions governing x, p, and &, and evaluating en-

semble averages within them.

Nosé—Hoover equations of motion (with initial CM velocity = 0) can be integrated by Stormer
finite centered differences°, where coordinates and the heat-flow variable are evaluated at inte-
gral values of the time step 6 (as are forces, which depend on coordinates) while velocities are
staggered by 6/2 (as is the temperature):

Appendix D: Error Analysis

1. Standard Error of the Mean

The standard error of the mean, e.g., for the thermostat variable, is estimated from:

oO
Omean = ’
VNerr

15

(Bl)
where o is the sample standard deviation, and Nery is the effective number of statistically inde-
pendent samples. In a time series with persistence over a characteristic timescale, tT, (the mean
correlation time, approximately the collision time — which also happens to be the usual best choice
for the thermostat relaxation time), Nerf * t/t. This yields the standard error formula:

o
vilt

This method is simple to implement, requires no auto-correlation or fitting analysis, and can be ap-

Omean =

plied to any observable (e.g., energy, pressure, thermostat variables) using the same set of thermal

zero-crossings.

2. Kinetic-Crossing Method

An alternative to estimating the standard error of the mean is the kinetic-crossing method (see
Fig. 2 of *). This approach estimates the number of effectively independent samples in a Nosé—
Hoover thermostatted trajectory by counting the number of times the instantaneous kinetic temper-
ature, T(t), crosses its mean value, (7), assumed equal to the thermostat value, 7p, at equilibrium.

We define a zero-crossing whenever T(t) changes sign relative to 7p, between successive time
steps, providing an estimate of the number of statistically independent fluctuations in the simula-
tion. Assuming each crossing corresponds to an effectively uncorrelated sample, i-€., Neross © t/T,
the standard error of the mean for an observable A can be estimated as:

Ocross = ss
where oy is the standard deviation of A over the trajectory.

We applied this method to estimate the uncertainty in the Nosé—Hoover friction coefficient, €,
and compared it to the t-based estimate. In Table II, we summarize results for all three systems,
N = 32 short and run long runs, and N = 1000. For N = 32 systems we compare the standard error
of (€) obtained via both the kinetic-crossing and the t-based methods and for N = 1000 system
we report that t-based estimate. The two estimates show good agreement. The results of our
MD simulations of a many-body soft-sphere fluid at equilibrium, far from the melting line, were
definitive: the distribution of the thermostatting coefficient is almost perfectly Gaussian, with zero
mean and median, and with the theoretical thermal width. These results correct a long-standing

misunderstanding in the behavior of the Nosé—Hoover thermostat and hold across both small and

16
large systems, with errors rigorously validated using two independent methods. We conclude that
skewed distributions of € are not intrinsic to the thermostat and we are not sure what was the

source of error in the Ref.” calculations.
