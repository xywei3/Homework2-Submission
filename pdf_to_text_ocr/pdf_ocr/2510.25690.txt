Abstract. We develop a second-order cosmological perturbation theory on a background
geometry expressed in terms of light-cone coordinates, extending the first-order analyses
available in the literature. In particular, we investigate the gauge transformations of second-

order perturbative quantities on the light-cone and establish their connection with standard

perturbation theory. Through a consistent matching procedure, we identify the second-order
gauge fixing that corresponds to the non-linear Geodesic Light-Cone gauge within standard
perturbation theory, known as the Observational Synchronous Gauge. We then emphasize its
conceptual similarities and differences wrt the standard Synchronous Gauge. Finally, within
his new perturbative framework, and adopting a fully gauge-invariant approach, we compute
che luminosity distance-redshift relation up to second order with anisotropic stress as seen by
a free-falling observer. Remarkably, we show how divergences at the observer position can be
eliminated in a completely model independent way. These results validate our perturbative

framework and establish it as a novel formalism for evaluating cosmological observables at

second order.

1 Introduction

Accurate measurements of the distance-redshift relation form the cornerstone of modern
observational cosmology. In the simplest homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaitre-
Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology, the distance-redshift relation dy(z) is a direct probe
of the expansion history of the Universe, underpinning the discovery of cosmic acceleration via
Type Ia supernovae surveys. However, the presence of inhomogeneities — arising from density
fluctuations, gravitational potentials, and peculiar velocities — modifies photon propagation
and introduces corrections to the observed distance-redshift relation. Understanding these
effects is essential for interpreting high-precision data from current and upcoming surveys
such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory’s LSST [1], Euclid [2], and the Nancy Grace Roman
Space Telescope [3].

At first order in cosmological perturbation theory, the impact of Large-Scale Structure
on the luminosity distance-redshift relation has been extensively studied. Pioneer works
4-9] derived expressions for the weak-lensing convergence, Shapiro time-delay, Sachs- Wolfe,
and Doppler contributions. These results have been used to forecast the magnitude of cosmic
variance in distance measurements and its correlation function [10, 11]. First-order calcula-
ions have proven adequate for many applications, but as observational uncertainties shrink

‘“owards the percent level and beyond, second-order effects become non-negligible.

Second-order perturbations generate new phenomena and couple different modes of the

inear theory. For instance, lensing-lensing and lensing—velocity couplings produce correc-

‘ions of second-order, while post-Born lensing gives rise to non-Gaussian contributions in the
magnification distribution [12-14]. Moreover, relativistic light-cone distortions and frame-
dragging effects enter at second order, potentially biasing cosmological parameter estimation
if left unaccounted for. In the literature, there are many possible approaches to compute
such non-linear effects, as e.g. the cosmic rulers approach! [16-19]. In general, many authors
have tackled these challenges in [20-24], by computing the second-order corrections to the
luminosity distance-redshift relation, galaxy number counts and next-to-leading order lens-
ing corrections [24-29], but focusing on specific gauge fixings and/or not totally considering
the adequate choice for terms at the observer position.

Indeed, the distance-redshift relation depends on the class of observers by whom it is
measured. This has been clearly pointed out for linear-order corrections in [30], where it
was shown that such a dependence also affects the well-posedness of the relation. At second
order, several attempts have been made to consistently account for this effect in different
types of observables, such as the redshift, the galaxy number counts, and the galaxy power
spectrum [31-34].

In these attempts, the observer is identified to be free-falling, which is well known to
be the one associated with the definition of the proper time in the Synchronous Gauge (SG).

However, as first shown in [35], this free-falling observer is also the one associated with the

"See also [15] for a first attempt to go beyond second order for the galaxy number count.
proper time of the Geodesic Light-Cone (GLC) gauge (first introduced in [36]) or of the

Observational Synchronous Gauge (OSG) (first introduced in [37]). The latter is defined

to be the standard, perturbative counterpart of the GLC gauge, and consists in a gauge

which preserves all the advantages of the GLC one, order by order in perturbation theory.

Therefore, the class of observers defined by the GLC gauge (or the OSG) is equivalent to the

one associated with the SG, and it will then measure

the same observables. On the other

hand, far from the observer position, these two gauge fixings are not equivalent. For example,

unlike the SG, photons travel on constant angles in the

GLC gauge, and this is one of the key

ingredients allowing us to obtain non-perturbative expressions for cosmological observables

within this gauge, as the redshift and the luminosity distance (see, for example, (20, 36, 38]).

With the aim of solving the above-mentioned issues, here we report a new method

based on the GLC gauge to compute relativistic correc

using it, we develop a comprehensive derivation of the

ions to cosmological observables and,

luminosity distance—redshift relation

at second order in cosmological perturbation theory and as seen by a free-falling observer

using a gauge-invariant and divergences free approach. Building upon the GLC formalism, we

systematically expand the distance-redshift relation to

second order and isolate the observer

dependent contributions, as was done in [37] at linear order.

Going into details, we will address three interrela‘

e Second-order gauge fixing at the observer position. By building upon the general

gauge transformation rules for cosmological perturbations, we implement a consistent
gauge choice at the observer position to second order. This involves specifying residual
gauge functions that uniquely fix time and spatial reparameterizations on the observer’s
worldline, thereby eliminating unphysical degrees of freedom in the local expansion of

the metric.

e Gauge invariance and cancellation of divergences. We will demonstrate that, once
observer-position terms and gauge conditions are properly accounted for (see the two
points above), all would-be divergent contributions cancel in the final expression for
the observed luminosity distance-redshift relation. In particular, we systematically

ensuring a manifestly finite and gauge-invariant result. Notably, these cancellations
occur without any assumption regarding the theory of gravity or the matter content of

the Universe.

As mentioned, to achieve these aims we employ the GLC gauge [36, 38], which facilitates

the separation of light-propagation effects into contributions along and orthogonal to the null
direction. We expand the photon wave-vector, affine parameter, and Sachs basis up to second
order, carefully tracking observer and source evaluations. Gauge transformations are handled
via Lie derivatives of the metric perturbations, with explicit computations of second-order
residual generators on the observer’s worldline. In particular, we methodically compare and
find a proper matching of our source terms with the literature [20, 23, 38], thus validating
our light-cone approach to cosmological observables at second order.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we describe two possible approaches to
cosmological perturbation theory: the standard one, where space-time is foliated into space-
ike hyper-surfaces, and the light-cone one, where space-time is foliated into light-like hyper-
surfaces. After a proper splitting of the perturbations according to their symmetry properties,
we compute the gauge transformations in both the approaches, working up to the second
perturbative order. We also establish a fully non-linear dictionary between the standard and
ight-cone perturbations. In Sect. 3, we start by defining the GLC gauge at a fully non-linear
order. Then, we impose the GLC gauge-fixing conditions at first and second order within
he light-cone perturbation theory, ending up with the forms that gauge modes needed to
ransform from a generic gauge to the perturbative definition of the GLC one. The standard
counterpart of such a gauge fixing, namely the OSG, is then defined in Sect. 4, where we point
out its similarities and differences wrt the SG. In Sect. 5, we recall how the GLC coordinates
urn out to be a very powerful tool to compute cosmological observables to any order in

perturbation theory. In particular, we provide exact, non-perturbative expressions for the
redshift and the angular distance. Then, we compute a set of first- and second-order gauge-
invariant variables associated with the GLC gauge and use them to define a new approach to
evaluate higher-order cosmological observables. As an application of this new perturbative

scheme, in Sect. 6 we focus on the computation of the angular distance-redshift relation as

seen by a free-falling observer. Thanks to a complete gauge-fixing procedure at the observer
position, we show a definite way to solve the long-standing issue of divergences associated

with the observer. To conclude, we provide the ultimate, gauge-invariant expression for the

angular distance-redshift relation, whose source terms are systematically matched with the
literature. Finally, the main conclusions and possible future directions of investigations are
summarized in Sect. 7. In Appendix A, we prove that the observer defined by the OSG is
free-falling, as well as the one of the SG.

2 Beyond Linear-Order Perturbation Theory on the Light-Cone

In this section, basically following the formalism first introduced in [37] (see also [39-41] for
further developments and applications of this perturbative framework), we will build a cosmo-
logical perturbation theory up to second order on top of the background light-cone geometry.
Afterwards, we will also establish a rigorous connection between this new perturbation theory

and the standard one.
2.1 Definition of perturbations

In order to consistently fix the notation and provide the context in which we will introduce
first- and second-order perturbations on a light-cone background, we just start by expressing
the standard perturbation theory up to second order using spherical coordinates.

Standard perturbation theory. We consider the perturbed FLRW metric using the
conformal time and spherical spatial coordinates, y = (n,r, 0%), as

where g,,, is the homogeneous and isotropic background metric, while gD and go respec-

tively stand for first- and second-order fluctuations. In this notation, the 2-dimensional

spatial background metric in polar coordinates is
aELRW = diag (r?, r? sin? 0). (2.2)

Using an index i = (r,6,~) to label spatial coordinates and adopting from now on the
superscript n = 1,2 to indicate first- and second-order perturbations, the Scalar-Vector-
Tensor (SVT) decomposition splits the various functions according to their transformation

properties under 3-dimensional rotations, that is,

In this decomposition, the vectors BO”) and F. (n) are divergenceless and the tensor ne

VEe?=0 , VEM=0 , BP=0, FAP =o. (2.6)

Next, from Eqs. (2.3) we can compute the SVT variables in terms of the metric perturbations
of Eq. (2.1). Indeed, taking ViB™, together with the condition vip” = 0, we obtain

Light-cone perturbation theory. We can now move to the set of background light-cone
coordinates indicated as c! = (r, w, 6), where 7 is the proper time of a time-like particle,
w defines the background light-cone of an observer and the angles 6 coincide with the two
polar angles (0, ¢) we observe in the sky. These coordinates are related to y“ through the

where Tin is a very early initial time at which perturbations were negligible. Then, the

Note that L™, M(™, N®), yl), u”™, v™ and pr are scalars under rotations on
he sphere, while 6), a”) and ji behave as pseudo-scalars. For this reason, in [37]
his decomposition was dubbed Scalar-PseudoScalar (SPS) decomposition. Because of their
different behavior under rotations, the scalar modes may also be referred to as electric and

he pseudo-scalar ones as magnetic.

2.2 Standard and light-cone gauge transformations

Now we will proceed with a systematic computation of the first- and second-order gauge

ransformations for standard and light-cone perturbations.

2.2.1 Gauge transformations at first order
Standard perturbation theory. Considering the first-order map y“ > g4 = y# + ey:
where e) is the gauge field, the first-order metric fluctuation transforms as

where Lea) is the Lie derivative along the 4-vector eA) and we underline that both go and
Fi are evaluated at the same coordinate y. Consequently, according to Eq. (2.20), the

FLRW metric perturbations introduced in (2.1) transform as

with H = Ona/a the conformal Hubble expansion rate. Then, following e.g. [44], we can
decompose ey) = dea) + er) (with Vie) = 0) and, using the decomposition of Eqs. (2.3)

Using the above gauge transformations, the metric can be gauge-fixed eliminating two scalar
and one vector perturbations. The most popular gauge choices (writing them at any order
in perturbation theory) are the following:

e Poisson Gauge (PG)?: B™ =0= E),
e Synchronous Gauge (SG): ge =0= Bl”).
¢ Uniform Curvature Gauge (UCG): J =0= BM,

important example is given by the gauge-invariant gravitational potentials 0 and U), also
known as Bardeen variables. At first order, we define them as the value that the perturbations
ge and yy acquire in the PG. In order to move to the aforementioned PG up to first order,

we need the following conditions? on the gauge modes,

oY = gi) a, (BY a,E) H(BY 4 a,B),

WY =~) + H(BO + a, BM) + zen) . (2.25)

Light-cone perturbation theory. Let us now consider a gauge transformation acting on
the light-cone coordinates, namely

ah + gh = oh + fy ‘ iy = (1. €G)» 0) - (2.26)
Then, using the formula
FD (@) = FD (@) — VP @) — VY? (2), (2.27)

as first computed in [37], we find that the first-order metric perturbations appearing in
Eq. (2.15) transform as

From now on, when using the light-cone coordinates, a “dot” denotes 0,, i.e. a partial
derivative wrt the time 7. Then, analogously to what usually done with the SVT decompo-
sition, we can further decompose the angular entries of the gauge field fy according to their

transformation properties under 2-dimensional rotations, that is,

hy =” (Doxa) + DoXay) ; (2.29)

At this stage, we can make use of the SPS decomposition of Eqs. (2.18) to obtain the trans-
formation properties of the SPS variables. In order to do so, we note that all the r.h.s. of
Eqs. (2.50)-(2.52) can always be written according to this decomposition. In particular, for
the vectors, calling H, each term appearing in Eqs. (2.50) and (2.51), this must have the
form*

Ty =r? (Dall + Dall) , (2.54)
where II is a pure scalar and Tisa pure pseudo-scalar. We can now use the fact that,
regardless of the coordinates we are using to parameterize the 2-sphere, it holds (see [37])

g’DaPy=9 , g” DiaDy) = D? =a" DiaDs)- (2.55)
Then, by contracting Eq. (2.54) with q*’D, and q@’Dy and by symmetrizing in the bottom
indices a,b, we can express both II and II in terms of II, as follows:

—1i4
~ 72 pet

a 11

b oH
a Dalle) ’ Us 2 pet D alloy « (2.56)

A similar procedure can be adopted for tensor perturbations, by calling H,, each term of
Eq. (2.52) and by decomposing it as

Tay = 2r? (dap + Dayo + Dav&) , (2.57)

where p contains the trace of Il,,, 7 is pure scalar and 6 is pure pseudo-scalar. Then, we
need to compute the contractions ¢”M15, D%M1g5, D%Ma5 remembering that (see again [37])

= a T ny ~ pm
g Dey =0= 9" Day = D"Day —, DY Day = (DP = D® Day (2.58)
For p we immediately get that

P= Ar

4We extract the factor r? from the decomposition of II, and Tas (see below) bearing in mind Egs. (2.18).

16
For o and 6 we must pay attention to the fact that, using the definition of the derivative

operator Dap, we can write
1
D° TL, = DY” Dayo = D°D? Dayo = (v:v'D.4 — 30%") o, (2.60)
where
D*DD,Dyo = (D*D.D"D, + D*([Ds, DalD'))o. (2.61)

Exploiting the usual definition of the Riemann tensor in terms of the commutator of covariant

derivatives, the second contribution to the above expression is

D®([Dp, Da|D°a) = D*(R?,,D°o) = D*qacD°o = D*o, (2.62)

‘cba
where, as provided e.g. in [48], we have used the general fact that, for a d-sphere of fixed
radius r and metric Yap, the Ricci tensor is given by

d= 1.

It follows that, summing the two contributions, we have

Moreover, in order to work out the gauge transformations of v2), 62), ul),

where x(n) are pure scalar gauge d.o.f. while X(n) are pure pseudo-scalar ones.
In this way, for 62) and 52) we get

The results of this subsection are the technical pillars on which our light-cone perturbation
theory at second order is based. They will also form the basis of the gauge-invariant formalism
that we will develop in the next section.

2.3 Map between standard and light-cone perturbation theory

To conclude this section, we establish a dictionary between the standard metric perturbations
f@ and the light-cone ones gh). In order to do so, exploiting the usual diffeomorphism law

Oy? Oy?
fw = Ban Bg 9°» (2.75)
we obtain the following relations and their inverse expressions:

aL = —2(¢ — $Crr — Br) ¢=-}(c?L +N +2aM)
aM = —Brp — Crp B, =—N —aM
MW = Cx Ce HN

" = ™ . (2.76)
OVe = —Ba.— Cra Ba= Ug —0Va,
Ua = Cee Cm = U,
OYab = Cad Cab = OYab

We have omitted the superscript n = 1,2 in the above equations because they have a fully
non-linear behavior, meaning that they are valid at any perturbative order.

As a consequence, using Eqs. (2.76), we have the possibility to express the SPS variables
in terms of the SVT ones at any order in perturbation theory. In particular, to obtain v, 0,
u and t& from V, and Ua we use Eqs. (2.56), while to obtain v, jz and fi from dq» we use
Eqs. (2.59), (2.64) and (2.65):

These new relations will be useful when we compute the angular distance in terms of the
PG gravitational potentials ® and W defined in Sect. 2.2. We emphasize that, as previously
shown at first order (see [37, 40]), the gauge transformations are properly mapped from the
standard perturbations to the light-cone ones.

3 The Geodesic Light-Cone Gauge

In this section, we will define the so-called Geodesic Light-Cone gauge at a fully non-linear
level. Then, we will show the realizations of the linearized and quadratic versions of such
a gauge fixing within the light-cone perturbation theory. In particular, we will provide the
explicit expressions of the the gauge modes needed to fix the GLC gauge at first and second

order.

3.1 Fully non-linear framework

In order to describe light signals propagating along the past light-cone of a free-falling ob-
server, it is convenient to resort to the so-called Geodesic Light-Cone (GLC) coordinates
x! = (7,w, 6%), first introduced in [36]. These coordinates, defined by the line element®

ds” 2Ydrdw + Y7dw? + gav(dd* — U*dw) (dd — U’dw) , (3.1)

are such that 7 is the proper time of a free-falling observer and the level sets of w identify
its past light-cone. Then, the intersection between constant 7 and constant w hyper-surfaces
defines a space diffeomorphic to a 2-sphere parameterized by the angles 6°.

In (3.1), we have introduced the six arbitrary functions YT, U% and gay = Joa, where the
symmetric metric gap) corresponds to the metric induced on the 2-sphere generated by the

vectors Ofja- In matrix form, the metric and its inverse read

0 -Y oO -1 -1/Y -u*/T
Qu =| -T Y?4+U? Uy j gv = —1/T 0 0 (3.2)
0 —uy Jab -—(U%)"/T 0 g”

with U* = gy, U2 =UU,g and g” = (Gav) Exploiting the above formulae, it is easy to
check that

J-H4) = YVJlal Owd,w=0 , OTV,(duT) =0, (3.3)

°See [49] for a “bottom-up” derivation of this metric.

22
where 94) = det[g,] and g = det[gap]. The second equality confirms that w is indeed a null
coordinate. The third equality, directly stemming from g’7 = —1, shows that 0,7 defines a
geodesic flow, i.e. uy, = —OyT = =O; is the 4-velocity of a free-falling observer, solution to
the time-like geodesic equations. Note also that

1 ue
a a
u (1 r ¥ ) j (3.4)

so, since light-rays propagate tangentially to the past light-cone of a free-falling observer
sitting on the tip of its light-cone, future time-like motion (i.e. photons incoming to the
observer) requires u“” > 0, hence T > 0. Furthermore, the normal vector to the w = const.
hyper-surfaces can be identified with

Wpbh
_ Vv w phys «
KE = —wphysgh Opw = —Wphysgh” = wa Or: (3.5)

Using the metric (3.1), we see that this vector is null (k"k, = 0), geodesic (k”V Lk" = 0) and
orthogonal to the 2-sphere parameterized by the angles 6 (kHA,0% x g”* = 0). Therefore,
it can be correctly interpreted as the wave-vector of photons incoming to an observer, being
the solution to the light-like geodesics 6* = const. So, Wphys is the physical frequency of the
signal. The fact that, in these coordinates, photons propagate with constant values of w and
6% makes it possible to obtain fully non-linear expressions for light-like observables, as shown
in [36, 38].

From a geometrical point of view, the standard FLRW metric (in spherical coordinates)
is recovered starting from the GLC one once we set

r=t , w=r4n(r) , Y=alt) , UX=0 , gapdb%dd’ = a?(t)r?2dQ?. (3.6)

In particular, as we will use later on, U/% vanishes in the FLRW limit.

To conclude, the metric (3.1) does not completely specify the gauge, because the fol-

lowing residual gauge transformations, 7.e.
wow =w'(w) , 6% > 6 = 6" (w, 6%) , (3.7)

preserve the form of the metric. As first pointed out in [38] (see also [49]), the first transfor-
mation amounts to relabelling light-cones, while the second one to relabelling light-rays with
the angles 6 and to how such a labelling is transferred from one light-cone to another.

3.2 Gauge modes at first order

Following [37], now we recall which conditions must be imposed on the first-order perturba-
tions appearing in the metric (2.15) such that the GLC gauge of Eq. (3.1) is recovered at a
perturbative level.

Fixing the GLC gauge in Eq. (2.15), such that its forms coincides with Eq. (3.1), requires

that the 77 and 7a metric entries must vanish. This leads to the following conditions:

ILM=0 , VO=o. (3.8)

23
Moreover, from Eq. (2.15) we also see that the rw and ww metric entries are related and

lead to the following additional condition:
NY +2aM =0. (3.9)
The condition viv = 0 can be then be safely obtained by
vh) =§69 =9, (3.10)

Next, using Eqs. (2.28) and (2.30), we can determine the dependence of the gauge field gi)
on the metric perturbations f to move from a generic gauge to the GLC one. In particular,

we obtain the following differential equations for the gauge fields,

stressed in [37], these last three functions reflect the fact that the GLC gauge is defined up

to the residual transformations of Eqs. (3.7).

3.3 Gauge modes at second order

Proceeding as above, the GLC gauge-fixing conditions at second order are

L?) —0,
VP) =0,
4n@) — (NM)? + 8aM@) — 402) =0. (3.18)

24
Using these equations and Eqs. (3.11) and (3.12), we can then compute the expressions for
the correspondent second-order gauge modes.

The constraint L@) = 0, imposed in Eq. (2.47), gives the following differential equation
for f(a):

rE) = —aL +O, (aLME)) + abfy GLO — en (Me + a0)

Using Eq. (3.16) we can now impose the constraints 62) = @) = 0 in Eqs. (2.67). From

4 The Observational Synchronous Gauge

In this section we will show how to impose the analogous of the GLC gauge in standard
perturbation theory at second order. This fixing is called the Observational Synchronous
Gauge, first introduced in [37] at first order in perturbation theory. We will then examine
the conceptual similarities and differences between this gauge and the Synchronous Gauge

(SG).
4.1 First order

As first pointed out in [37], using Eqs. (2.76), it is easy to see that the first-order gauge fixing
in standard perturbation theory, equivalent to the GLC one described in Eqs. (3.8)-(3.10), is

given by

1

g@=0 , BM=- sc , BY=-cl, (4.1)

rr

where we note that we still have the condition go) = 0, as in the SG. Furthermore, let us
recall that within the GLC gauge not only the time 7 is the one of a free-falling observer,
but we also have that the angles 6¢, representing the directions of observation in the sky, are
constant along the light-cone. Consequently, in [37] the standard counterpart of the GLC
gauge, described in (4.1), was dubbed Observational Synchronous Gauge (OSG).

26
As a conclusive remark, note also that the naive to all-orders extension of the SG
consists in imposing the conditions ¢ = 0 and B = 0 at a fully non-linear level, whereas here
an order-by-order fixing of the OSG is performed.

4.2 Second order

Let us now show how to fix the OSG at second order and explain why this choice must be
exploited order by order. Starting from Eqs. (2.76), which are valid at any perturbative

order, the conditions L®) =0 and ve) = 0 immediately give

BA=-ce@D gM = =5(w® +2aM)). (4.2)
By considering the remaining constraint of Eqs. (3.13), ie. 4N@) + 8aM@) — (Nn)? -
4UG,) = 0, we can then note that
1 2
2 i 2
Mas [on Pry AUR) (4.3)
Furthermore, using the above results and Eqs. (2.76) we can easily obtain the relation
‘ 1
BY) = 6) — 5c). (4.4)

Summarizing, we have the following relations that can be used to define the OSG at the
second perturbative order:

9 =—2[(N)? +4v%)] , B= Fe , BO =-c@. (45)

Let us note that 6) ¢ 0, whereas this is not the case at first order. However, as first
pointed out in [35], the proper time 7 of the GLC gauge is non-perturbatively equal to the
one of the SG. This implies that, at any perturbative order, the observers of the SG and
OSG are both free-falling and then physically equivalent. Therefore, they measure the same
physical observables. For the sake of completeness, and as a non-trivial check of our new

perturbation theory, we will prove the above point that both the SG and OSG observers are

free-falling in Appendix A by working at the perturbative level within light-cone perturbation
theory.

Instead, we now present a detailed comparison between the two gauges, focusing on their
similarities and differences through the GLC gauge modes derived in the previous section.
In particular, by expressing these gauge modes starting from the SG formulation defined on
the light-cone background with perturbations, we demonstrate that the GLC/OSG and SG

gauges are fully equivalent at the observer position, but differ elsewhere. More specifically, in
the GLC/OSG gauge the hyper-surfaces w = const. non-perturbatively define the past light-
cone of the observer, and the angular coordinates 6* remain constant along this light-cone
(nce = 6

source observer

). These properties do not hold in the SG.

27
In order to show that, let us first derive the SG counterpart on the perturbed light-cone
background. We have that the non-perturbative definition of the SG is given by ”) = 0,
B) = 0 and Be”) = 0 for any perturbative order n. As a consequence, using Eqs. (2.76),
the non-perturbative version of the SG in the perturbative light-cone framework is given by

LE) +N + 2M” =0,

N = -aM™,

vo) = ty,
a
9) — balm) (4.6)

a

Let us now make an brief remark and first look at the gauge transformations needed to
fix the GLC gauge. Starting from Eqs. (2.76), and using the expression of ¢“ in Eqs. (3.12),
we obtain the first-order gauge mode to go to GLC gauge written in standard perturbation
theory:
T ”
£11) a dr’ bY (7'w —(7)+ n(r')) = / drab (xf, r). (4.7)
Tin Tin

This shows how £1) corresponds to same time-shift of the SG, obtained by requiring g) =0

and B = 0 in Eqs. (2.22). This first result already show at first order how the GLC proper
time and the SG one are identical.

In general, taking the limit tr > 7, in Eqs. (3.12) at first order and in Eqs. (3.16),
(3.17) and (3.20) at second order, we see that the only non-zero gauge modes are the time
ones, modulo a non-zero integration constant in €{” and €9. Thus, a priori the only difference

between a general gauge and the GLC one would be in the definition of the proper time at

the observer. Then, as a matter of fact, with a little of algebra one can prove that the first
and second-order time gauge modes needed to move from the SG to the GLC one (or the
OSG) are zero. Indeed, using the first of Eqs. (4.6), we immediately see that 1) =O.

At second order, we can just use Eqs. (3.11) and (4.6) into (3.19) and (3.20), to show
that, after some algebraic manipulations we get,

_ Ow&f
+ =0. (4.8)

a

This proves that the solution for (2) is a constant, which can be safely taken to be zero.
In this way, the conditions cise 08c) = i286 08c) = 0 are valid in general, not only in
the limit 7 + 7). This is a consequence of the fact that both the observers in OSG and SG
foliate the space-time into the same 7 = const. hyper-surfaces.

On the other hand, the light-cone and angular gauge modes to go from the SG to the

GLC gauge are non-zero and given at first order by

1 te 1
étiy = 3f dr’ M+,

28
To qr! 1 ts Price)
= a“! (,,@) 4 = a (1)
x1) [ 5 (« ap ap [ dr a +Xx0 >

- tS da! “i
Xa) = [ — il + x, (4.9)
ST

which is consequence of the fact that the two gauges share the same proper time and are
physically equivalent at the observer position, but differ at a generic time different from the
one of the observer. At the second order, we also have non-zero expressions for &(9)> x2) and
Xz), that we do not show here for sake of brevity.

5 Gauge-Invariant Variables and Observables

In this section, we will first recall that cosmological observables admit non-perturbative
expressions once the GLC gauge is fixed. As mentioned, this is ensured by the fact that,
in the GLC gauge, observer and source are connected through 6* = constant geodesics on
a w = constant past light-cone of a free-falling observer. We will then compute two sets
of gauge-invariant variables which correspond to the first- and second-order versions of the
GLC gauge. Finally, we will provide an unified treatment of all the GLC approaches to
cosmological perturbations currently available in the literature.

5.1 Cosmological observables in the Geodesic Light-Cone gauge

Redshift. Considering that in the GLC gauge the photon 4-momentum and the 4-velocity

of a free-falling observer are given by
ky = O,w ) Up = —OpT , (5.1)
in [36] it has been shown that the redshift in GLC coordinates is exactly given by

(Wu) _ Tro. 6) on
(kup)o — U(r, w, 02)” .

where we have accounted for the fact that the source and the observer are lying on the same
light-cone, namely ws = wo = w. The subscripts “s” and “o” stand for evaluation at the

source and observer position.

Angular distance. Another late-time cosmological observable admitting a simple, non-
perturbative expression within the GLC gauge fixing is the angular distance, which we call
da. In a generic framework, the latter can be computed as the square root of the determinant
of the Jacobi map IRs connecting a source to a given observer via the relation (see [50])

AO) = F800 0) (SE) , AB=1,2, (5.3)

k’ uy

29
where C4 = ¢ Ast is the displacement between 2 geodesics due to the geodesic deviation effect,
) is the affine parameter along the geodesics, (4 = Quv6"s4 and the vectors sh are defined
by the conditions (see [51, 52])

with

Vy Vu ? v vy (ukp)? wkp (5 5)
If we then fix the GLC gauge, in [38] it was first shown that, in this case, we have
: g
a = det [Jp] vet. (5.6)

The determinant at the observer has a simple limit in the so-called observational gauge. This
was proved in [53], and we will also demonstrate this in the next section using perturbation

theory.

5.2 Gauge-invariant variables on the light-cone

GLC gauge-invariant variables. Here we report a set of first- and second-order gauge-
invariant variables which will be exploited while evaluating the angular distance—redshift
relation in a gauge-invariant way within the perturbative scheme defined in the previous
sections.

In particular, starting from Eqs. (3.12), (3.16), (3.17) and (3.20), which give the de-
pendence of the gauge fields fy and fio) on the metric perturbations in order to move from
a general gauge to the GLC gauge, we can perform a gauge transformation on the original
perturbative light-cone variables using these fields. In this way, we obtain a set of variables
which are automatically gauge invariant.

Proceeding as above, the set of gauge-invariant variables corresponding to the linearized
version of the fully non-linear GLC gauge of Eq. (3.1) was already obtained in [37] with the
following result:

1 1 ci
() = /(@) _ = p?. 7 ( Q)

MY) = pO) — kay

1) (@) Q) :
UY =u + 75 — “> — Ow)»
LY = tO — ALK ay. (5.7)
The above quantities are gauge invariant since they are the values of the perturbations of
the GLC gauge written in a general gauge. Here, the gauge modes are the ones obtained in
Eqs. (3.12), unlike the formulae written in Eqs. (2.28) and (2.30). The same reasoning holds
for the second-order gauge-invariant variables that we report in the following,

Evaluation in terms of Bardeen potentials. To conclude, we now want to rewrite the
first- and second-order gauge modes needed to fix the GLC gauge in terms of the gravitational
potentials 6 and WU) at first and second order (see Eqs. (2.25) and (2.46)). These are also
the values that the standard perturbations eo” and yw) acquire in the Poisson gauge, defined
by the conditions E™) =0 = BM, Therefore, to do so we fix the gauge corresponding to
PG within our new perturbation theory. By neglecting vector and tensor fluctuations and
by imposing the two aforementioned relations in Eqs. (2.77), valid at any order, we obtain

the following non-perturbative definition of the PG:

2 2
L=— 5640) , Mast , N= , vod,
a

v=0 , 6=0 , w=0 , @=0 , p=0 , f=0. (5.10)

31
From now on, following the notation of (20, 23, 54], we will use the definitions

T To I
P= al dr’ Bo) (w — (r) +n(r7')) ‘ Q= / ar (w) +0), (5.11)

and we will omit the superscript “1” for the first-order perturbations ® and VY. Moreover,
we define the isotropic and anisotropic parts of the Bardeen potentials as
_¥+e wot?

= ; an

Keeping ® 4 W already at first order allows us to consider also the case of non-vanishing
anisotropic stress in the Einstein equations, which would be relevant to dark energy or mod-

wl (5.12)

ified gravity models (see, for example, [55-59]).

Then, the forms that the first-order gauge modes (3.12) acquire using Eqs. (5.10) are

fa) =aP,

E(1) =-Q+ ww) ;

T° dr!

Since we are adopting a gauge-invariant procedure, we can already fix the PG at the level of
the gauge modes. For the sake of completeness, we also report the first-order GLC gauge-

invariant variables (5.7) written in this notation:

and, from Eq. (3.20) we can rewrite &(2) in a more compact form after repeated integra-
tions by parts. Putting everything together, our second-order gauge modes in terms of the

33
Let us remark that Eqs. (5.13) and (5.18) are relevant outcomes of the general second-
order perturbation theory developed so far. Indeed, any light-like cosmological observable can
be first computed at a fully non-linear level using GLC coordinates. Then, it can be expanded
up to the desired perturbative order within the framework of light-cone perturbation theory.
After that, in order to have an expression valid in any gauge, we can use Eqs. (5.7) and
(5.8). Finally, thanks to the gauge modes of Eqs. (5.13) and (5.18) we can write the general

relativistic corrections in terms of the gauge-invariant gravitational potentials.

5.3 A unification of all the Geodesic Light-Cone approaches

Before proceeding with the computation of the angular distance-redshift relation, we first
clarify the connection between our approach and the coordinate transformation methods
employed in [20, 23, 38, 54, 60].

In the gauge transformation given by Eq. (2.31), we have derived the conditions required
to transform from a generic gauge fixing (later identified with the Poisson gauge) to the GLC
gauge. Hence, the two systems of coordinates are related by

2 1

where we recall that y“ denote the coordinates in the PG, while gy“ correspond to the GLC
coordinates. In other words, Eq. (5.19) explicitly provides the relations between our gauge
modes and the fluctuations 72), w(t?) and 6°02) first derived in [35] through a full coor-
dinate transformation stemming from

_ oy oy” pu

geL0 (g) = Oye Oyr PG (y) - (5.20)

Indeed, using Eq. (5.19), and neglecting terms at the observer position, at first order these

relations are
7) = . w(t) = eH , 9 = (5.21)

2) _ 1 T He T

ane) = w He w
w) = 5 (i + Ey Auéthy) »
Pa? 1
a(2) __ a be a
OO = 5 (Ey 7 huey) : (5.22)

On the other hand, the second approach described for the first time in [54] is based on the
inverse coordinate transformation

v Oy" OY" pg 7 ~
gpaly) = age aga sero) » (5.23)
where now gy are the GLC coordinates and y“ = (n,nt,0%), with nt = +1, are the PG
background coordinates. At this point, we can expand y/ in terms of 7 up to the desired

order as
yf = (yh) OG) + YO D + YO +.-, (5.24)

and then expand the PG components of (5.23) around (y)(g). In this way, we get differ-
ential equations for the fluctuations (n,7+“), 0°), whose solutions, from [54], are

.
nq) = al dr’ Wi(7!,w —(7)+ n(r’), 0°) ;

Hence, comparing the above formulae with Eqs. (5.13), we notice that

$0) _

a

7 -P, qt) = -€), ga) = — Ey, (5.26)

provided that we neglect the terms at the observer position wi (w), x6? (w) and 40) (w).

At second order, the comparison of Eqs. (5.15) and (5.18) to Eqs. (4.19), (4.21) and
(A.5) of [54] entails the following dictionary between our gauge modes (2); &(2): f(y) and the

the relation between the perturbations of the two approaches — namely, those of Eqs. (5.20)
which are equivalent to [20, 23] and (5.23) which are equivalent to the inverse approach
developed in [54] — is simply fy = —et). At second order, Lie derivatives also come into
play, which is why the relations between the fluctuations of the two methods described in
[54] are

The above analysis clarifies the connections between our approach, which is manifestly written
as a gauge transformation, and the previous approaches of the GLC literature. In our case,
we perform a background coordinate transformation, followed by a gauge transformation of
the metric perturbations directly on the past light-cone. Instead, the previous approaches
directly performed a perturbative coordinate transformation.

6 The Observational Angular Distance—Redshift Relation

Hereafter, we will apply the new perturbative scheme developed so far to compute the angular
distance-redshift relation da(z), as measured by a free-falling observer and in a perturbative
and gauge-invariant approach, starting from the fully non-linear formulae (5.2) and (5.6)
valid within the GLC gauge. In the evaluation of such an angular distance, as anticipated at
the end of the previous section, we will go through the following steps:

1. First, in order to use and expand formula (5.6) in perturbation theory, we need to fix

the GLC gauge at first and second order. Then we “unfix” the gauge by replacing each

perturbation with each gauge-invariant counterpart provided in Eqs. (5.7) and (5.8);

2. Then, using the observed redshift as a time coordinate, we add to da the corrections
coming from expanding each quantity around the time at the source corresponding to
the observed redshift, thus obtaining the fully gauge-invariant formula for the angular
distance-redshift relation;

3. Finally, we express each light-cone perturbation in terms of the Bardeen potentials ®)
and ©) and compare the results with the one already present in the literature.

In particular, we will show how the complete fixing of the residual gauge freedom (3.7) of
the GLC gauge allows for the elimination of divergences at the observer position.

6.1 Perturbative expansion

Comparison between perturbed and unperturbed metrics. As a starting point, we
consider the fully non-linear GLC metric introduced in Eq. (3.1) and we express the functions
Y and Y* in terms of the GLC perturbations appearing in the metric (2.15), working up to

second order. In general, we can write
Y=TOt¢T9+7%) UX =U) UG), (6.1)

where we have accounted for the fact that U% has zero background value, as we have specified
after Eqs. (3.6). Then, we can conformally re-scale the 2-dimensional metric of Eq. (3.1) as
Jab = aap. In this way, comparing the off-diagonal terms dwd6" of Eqs. (2.15) and (3.1),
we can straightforwardly obtain that

2a” yan(Uir + Uf )dwdd” = 2a2(UY) + U?))dwad. (6.2)

By explicitly writing the perturbations of yp, we have

2 = i =

a = av U(r + Fatll(oy Ub) = 7 (Us — he MUG)
Next, taking the terms proportional to dw?, we have

1? 4UU, = 7(1+NY +N), (6.5)

Considering that the 2 x 2 spatial metric of Eq. (2.15) is gap = a?ab, from a perturbative

point of view we have
UU = gal U? = a Fn Uiy = PUR UL) = CUR). (6.6)

Therefore, Eq. (6.5) becomes

[1+ 2r + (1)? 427?) + U2) = @(14 NO +N), (6.7)

By respectively equaling terms of first and second order together, we get the relations’

Perturbative formula for the redshift and redshift parameterization. As first re-
marked in [30], the angular distance is a bi-scalar, being affected by the gauge transformations
both at the source and at the observer positions. So, to completely fix the gauge, we need

to account for both these effects (see also [37] for a more detailed discussion). Regarding
the latter, thanks to what we have discussed at the end of Subsect. 2.3, the usage of the
sets of gauge-invariant variables (5.7) and (5.8) entirely fixes the observer’s gauge modes.
Regarding the former, since da does not depend on the angles at the background level, we
are left with 2 conditions to be fixed in order to eliminate the gauge freedom: (i) as for the w
gauge mode, since formula (5.6) is valid within the GLC gauge, we are already imposing that
the photons emitting the luminous signal propagate on the past light-cone; (ii) moreover, we

"We choose Y? = a? = Y = +a consistently with the requirement that u” > 0 (see discussion after
use the observed redshift of the source to fix the time gauge mode, as we are about to show
hereafter.

Starting from the exact formula (5.2) for the redshift and using Eqs. (6.8), we obtain

Cosmological surveys typically provide us with data sets of the form (z, da(z)), z being the
redshift of the source. Thus, we perturbatively redefine the proper time at the source as

r= 4 o®, (6.10)

where T, is the proper time of the source evaluated at the observed redshift z and ft?)

are the distorsions at first and second order caused by the presence of inhomogeneities and
anisotropies along the line of sight (see, for example, [31, 32]). As a side remark, note that we
do not have to do the same also for the coordinates w and 6% because, since we are working
within the GLC gauge, observations are made on the past light-cone, namely w = const.,
and the angles are precisely those of the background. Following this strategy, we first Taylor
expand

More in general, any scalar quantity X can be expressed in terms of the observed
redshift working up to second order in perturbation theory, in the simplest case in which its
background counterpart only depends on the time 7, namely X (a!) = X(r). Indeed, starting

from
X (al) = X(r) + XM (a) + XO) (cht) (6.13)

and considering Eq. (6.10), we can Taylor expand as follows,

X(r) = X (rz) + X (rz) 7) + X (72) ) +
XO (oH) = XO(7,) + XO (7), (6.14)
XA (eH) = X)(r,) F

where, for the sake of brevity, we omit to also report the dependence of the perturbations on
the coordinates (w, 6). In this way, we can write

X(ae") = KX, 4+ XM 4x2) (6.15)
with

XY= X (te) +XO(r),

X (re) (YP + XO (re. (6.16)

Perturbative formula for the angular distance—redshift relation. We are now ready
to obtain an up to the second-order perturbative expression for dq and then expand it
according to the redshift parameterization outlined in the previous paragraph, thus getting
the relation for da(z).

Looking back at Eq. (5.6), we first have to compute the (square root of the) determinant

of the metric, which, using the GLC coordinates, is exactly given by

J-94) = TVG ; g = det[gav] = a‘ det [a0] =a'y. (6.19)

In order to calculate y, we simply use that yap is a 2x 2 matrix: exploiting the SPS decompo-
sition (2.18) and the fact that, from the definitions given in (2.19), ¢*Das = 0, q*°Dav = 0,

Finally, just for the sake of completeness, by combining Eq. (6.19) with the above
formula, we find that J- 4) perturbed up to second order is

we find

a = 2ar{ [(aHr 1)(1+2v)+4 arv| dab + 2(aHr —1)(Davp+ Davii) + Davit+ Davi} , (6.27)

and, using that v =v +v®@, p= p© +p) and a = pi + pa), we obtain

As a next step, using Eqs. (6.16) and (6.18) we expand the the background and linear
expression for the angular distance around the observed redshift as:

We can then obtain a formula for da(z) which is gauge invariant both at the source and at the
observer positions. Indeed, as explained in the previous paragraph, the gauge at the source
is fixed once we adopt the redshift parameterization, while the one at the observer is fixed
once, in the expression (6.31) of da, we substitute each variable with its gauge-invariant
counterpart provided in Eqs. (5.7) and (5.8) at first and second order respectively (this
amounts to requiring that the observer is geodesic). By doing this, the result, as function of
the redshift, can be written as

variables Y) contain terms diverging with negative powers of r, and we will analyze this
issue in the next subsection.

Then, by Taylor expanding up to second order formula (6.34) using the previous result,

Finally, once we replace in the above equations the explicit forms of the gauge-invariant
perturbations (5.7) and (5.8), and we plug the expressions of the gauge modes (3.12), (3.16),
(3.17) and (3.20), we obtain the fully gauge-invariant form of the angular distance-redshift

relation on the past light-cone within the perturbative scheme developed in this paper.

6.2 Gauge fixing at the observer position

As we have already stressed, the GLC gauge at the observer position is not totally specified:
this residual gauge freedom is encoded in the functions wi” (w, 6°), x (w, 6%) and eo (w, 6”)
arising in the first and second-order gauge modes needed to fix the GLC gauge in perturbation
theory.

In this subsection, we will demonstrate how a well-motivated choice of these free func-
tions is capable at once of completely fixing the “observational” gauge and eliminating po-
tentially diverging terms at the observer position.

First-order analysis. Let us first discuss about the choice of wh) (w, 6). Looking back

at Eqs. (6.38), one can see that

. D2y) : . 1 &F, 1 /&, DE
(1) _ +(1) r rt @). en Vi; (1) ew (1)
V Vy 5) HE) Heh +78 ( 4 et) t =a( a. &(i) 2 ) ® (6.39)
Thus,
‘ fae 1 /&;, pew
(ar7 28 [o2-( A et) ; ( a éty 5 IE (6.40)

which diverges as r~! when r — 0 at the observer position. In order to eliminate such a

divergence, following [37], we impose the condition

D’\ 4a) (%)
(: + a) uf = "ae (6.41)
Since (EA))o is a monopole (see Eq. (4.7)), the general solution is
- & s
wh) (w, 6) = (), +d) (w) Pi (cos 6") , (6.42)
ao

with ds) (w) a free function of w and P; the Legendre polynomial of order 1. However, at a
fully non-linear order, the GLC gauge admits the symmetry w > w’(w), as we have recalled

43
in Eqs. (3.7). Thus, in order to be consistent with this symmetry, we require that ds =0,
namely wh? is a pure monopole:
(%)
wh) =, (6.43)
Ao

The relevant consequence of this choice is that

ty = Sunbly a + Ey (iy). =0. (6.44)

Therefore, from a physical point of view, we are requiring that the observer is set at the
center of the polar coordinates.

Moreover, we can also reason in the opposite way wrt what done so far, that is, we start
by requiring that the observer is set at the center of the polar frame, 7.e. ro = Wo— (To) = 0.
Then, in order to preserve the condition wo = (7) in any other gauge, by taking the first-
order gauge transformations

TOTHT+EY) ’ wrw=wt fy , n> h=ntely, (6.45)

we have to demand that, locally around the observer, it holds

(<i), = 06 = (’), = (de, (6.46)

do

which is exactly condition (6.43). Therefore, at the observer we are left with
VO =v) —Ha(Gy) A= NM —2H (By) - (6.47)
oO oO
Also the residual angular gauge modes Ww, 6°) and ” (w, 6°) can be fixed to require
the observational gauge, where the angles 6* coincide with the observed angular directions
of incoming photons in the sky, as in the so-called Fermi Normal Coordinates (see [53]). Let
us consider the first-order gauge transformation mapping the angles as 6% + 6% + (EG) )o,
with (ffi) = (Dox? + Dox?) at the observer position. In the GLC gauge, the angles
are precisely the background ones of the polar frame, namely 6* = 6% (see also [54]), hence
(ey) = 0, which is satisfied upon assuming that
oO

x =P), MP = Pw). (6.48)

More in general, since no preferable angular direction at the center of the polar frame is
allowed, any quantity X evaluated at the observer position must satisfy D,X, = 0.

Second-order analysis. The techniques described above can be conveniently extended
also to second order. In particular, upon requiring the monopole conditions

w) = 5 XM ax) eM = Rw), (6.49)

44
we are able to eliminate all the divergences around the observer position. This is one of
the key results of our work, showing for the first time in the literature that, both at first
and second order, these cancellations can be achieved only by requiring the “geometrical” or
“kinematic” conditions (6.49) (namely, no assumption on the underlying cosmological model
is needed).
To prove that this is indeed the case also at second order, we take
: Go ¢ 2 (2

6.3. Detailed expressions for the angular distance—redshift relation

We are now ready to fully open formulae (6.38) for da(z) and compare our results to the
ones obtained directly in standard perturbation theory. This is also a consistency check of
the perturbative scheme that we have developed in this paper.

In order to do so, we express each light-cone perturbation in terms of PG quantities
through the relations (5.10), which can be directly plugged into Eqs. (6.38) because the latter
are valid in any gauge.

6.3.1 First-order angular distance—redshift relation

Before moving to standard coordinates, we recall that the partial derivatives transform as
1 :
Or = = (On Op) 5 Ow =r 5 Oa = Doe 5 (6.53)
and that, for a generic quantity X, we have (see [31, 37])

OwX (7!,w = (7) + (7')) = AX (no = 1) 5 (6.54)

45
and

d
OwX (7',w) = OX (1, Mo — 0') = Oy X (0! Mo — ') — Gap te —1). (6.55)

Moreover, let us define the radial peculiar velocity

Then, using Eqs. (6.54) and (6.55) and the definition (6.56) into the first-order gauge modes

As a first consistency check of Eq. (6.59) with [37], one can easily verify that the same
result is recovered by first moving to standard coordinates and then imposing the PG fixing
conditions FE = 0 = B. However, from a computational point of view, it is more convenient
(0 fix the PG conditions still within the GLC formalism, so as to write dy (z) only in terms

of ® and W, and finally go back to standard coordinates, as we have done so far.

As a final step regarding the first-order evaluation of da(z) in terms of the Bardeen
potentials ® and W, we can now compare our result (6.59) with the ones present in the
iterature. In particular, all but the last line of our Eq. (6.59) match with the works [6, 20]
for vanishing anisotropic stress and with [23] for the case of case of non-vanishing anisotropic

stress.

Moreover, the last term of (6.59) at the observer position matches with the quantity

hat the authors of [30, 31] called the time-shift. This is needed to re-express the angular
distance-redshift relation of [20, 23] in a gauge where the observer is free-falling.

6.3.2 Second-order angular distance—redshift relation

In this final subsection, we will present our complete result for the angular distance-redshift
relation as measured by a free-falling observer. Before reporting the full formulae, we will
separately focus on the numerator and denominator of Eq. (6.34). In this way, we will be able
to show that the purely source terms of da(z) agree with the ones of the literature as they
are gauge invariant/observer independent. On the other hand, we will provide the explicit
form of all the new terms at the observer position due to our complete gauge fixing procedure

associated with the geodesic observer.

Numerator of the angular distance—redshift relation. Let us start from the numer-
ator of d2)(z) as written in (6.34), namely the first of Eqs. (6.35). We replace the GLC

gauge-invariant variables with their explicit forms (5.8) and write everything in terms of WU!

and U4. By defining = = 1— on , and omitting the superscript “1” for first-order gauge
modes, the result is®

In order to prove this, we just need

o recall the relations connecting the PG quantities

to the GLC gauge ones, obtained in [54] starting from the diffeomorphism law (2.12) for the
inverse metrics, as we have done in Subsect. 5.3. Indeed, by plugging into Eq. (6.62) the

As a technical remark, in doing the comparison with [54], we noticed that the terms

Therefore, the complete gauge-invariant formula for the angular distance-redshift relation is
obtained once we sum Eqs. (6.62) and (6.67), by replacing the explicit forms of the second-

We thoroughly compared Egs. (6.71)-(6.75) to Eqs. (3.29)-(3.32) of [23] and found an almost
perfect agreement for the purely source terms, with only few differences. One concerns the
last term on the first line of (6.72) (the correspondent term of [23] has coefficient —a which
is most likely a typo, as our result agree with [20, 38]), whereas others are probably related
to the way to manipulate nested integrals and deal with integration by parts. We would
also like to stress that, in [54] the authors use their Eq. (A.24) to facilitate the comparison
of their result (A.17) with the previous ones in the literature [20, 38]. Instead, in our case,
we have shown that the corresponding relations between the coordinate perturbations in the
two approaches is explicitly given in Eqs. (5.29). Indeed, at first order, our gauge modes
coincide with the coordinate perturbations obtained in the first approach of [20, 38], see our
Eqs. (5.21).

The most relevant outcome of the above results is that the systematic cross-check of

our second-order source terms with the literature [20, 23, 38] provides a definite validation
of the light-cone perturbation theory developed in this paper.

These last four equations represent one of the most remarkable results of this paper, be-
cause they confirm that the GLC gauge is a very convenient gauge to compute cosmological

observables to higher orders in perturbation theory, having a divergences free result.

7 Summary and Conclusions

In this manuscript we have developed a second-order cosmological perturbation theory adapted
to the observer past light-cone, extending previous first-order results [37]. Starting from a
homogeneous and isotropic background in the Geodesic Light-Cone (GLC) coordinates, we
have constructed general perturbations and analyzed their gauge transformation properties.
The corresponding GLC gauge fixing conditions have been derived at second order, both in
terms of light-cone perturbations and within standard perturbation theory. In particular,
following [37], the standard counterpart of the GLC gauge has been dubbed Observational!
Synchronous Gauge (OSG).

Within the GLC gauge, the past light-cone coincides with the background one, anc
observables are factorized in terms of products of perturbations evaluated at the source
and observer positions. Consequently, light-like cosmological observables expressed in the
GLC gauge. or in the OSG one, are manifestly bi-scalar (as already stated in [30]) anc
depend solely on local metric perturbations. When rewritten in terms of gauge-invarian

Bardeen variables, the usual integrated effects such as gravitational lensing, the ISW effec

and the Shapiro time-delay naturally emerge. This provides a systematic and gauge-invarian
framework to compute cosmological observables to non-linear order using the exact relations
of [36, 38] and the gauge transformations connecting the GLC gauge to the Poisson Gauge
(PG).

By applying this framework, we have derived the second-order expression for the angular

distance-redshift relation, as an informative application and with the aim of validating our

perturbative framework and method through the comparison of the results obtained to the
ones of the present literature. In particular, our procedure has been based on the following

steps:

e First we identify the fully non-linear formula for the redshift and for the angular distance
valid in the GLC gauge and we expand them up to second order within our perturbative

framework;

e Next, we express the angular distance in terms of the observed redshift, the observer’s

past light-cone and the observed angles;
e Thereafter, we promote each perturbations to its gauge-invariant counterpart;

e Finally, we fix the PG to express the general relativistic effects in terms of the gravita-
tional potentials.

The above techniques represent a new approach to compute higher-order relativistic effects
to cosmological observables, validated by the fact that our results exactly reproduce® all
known source terms from the literature based on the GLC gauge (see [20, 23, 38]). They also
provide additional observer’s contributions which, to our knowledge, have not been previously
identified. Indeed, our observer terms come from the fact that we have considered the angular
distance-redshift relation as measured by a free-falling observer, where, working in the GLC
gauge, the residual gauge freedom is exploited together with the additional requirement tha‘
the center of the coordinates coincides with the observer position. Thanks to this carefu.
construction, non-physical divergences at the observer position have been eliminated, thus
confirming the predictions and results of [30, 37].

Another important point is that, while the GLC gauge provides a simple geometrica
interpretation of cosmological observables, the associated perturbation dynamics is more
intricate than in standard perturbation theory. On the other hand, the OSG is fully equivalen
to the GLC gauge and it is entirely formulated within the standard perturbative framework.

Consequently, the dynamics and all related physical properties can be studied using the usual
tools of standard perturbation theory, which may lead to an alternative solution of the long-
standing problem of the dynamics in the GLC gauge. This point is left for future studies.
The use of GLC guauge directly in standadrd pertubraton theory will be the subject of future
studies.

In summary, we have presented a general framework to compute second-order cosmo-
logical observables, within light-cone perturbation theory (the GLC gauge). We have val-
idated our method by recovering the known source terms in the second-order angular dis-
tance-redshift relation and identified new observer contributions, which renders the result

free of divergences. This new perturbation theory can conveniently pave the way for the

computation of other cosmological observables on the light-cone up to second order, as, for

example, the galaxy number count [24, 61-64] or the redshift drift [65, 66).

°A part from few terms out of hundreds, probably due to typos or differences in integration by parts and/or
the way to expand terms.

A Free-Falling Observer

Let us now show how both the SG and OSG observers are free-falling. In particular, the
observer defined by the OSG is free-falling despite the fact that O26 #0.

As a first step, let us consider the observer associated with the proper time 7 in a

TT

generic gauge. Then, we can prove that the condition!® g77 = —1 non-perturbatively defines

a free-falling observer, regardless of the specific form of the metric. Indeed, following [67], by

taking the 4-velocity u, = —0,,7 = 47, associated with this observer, we have
1
TV (nT) = —9"" Ty = 59 I? OnIp - A.1)
Since we are assuming g’” = —1, it follows that
Ong" = On(9"? 9" Gup) = 9, A.2)

from which we have

Ty

GG Ondpv = —9" pv"? — GF? GvpAg"” = —20,97" = 9, A.3)

thus proving that 0’7V_(OuT) = 0.

As a second step, and a non-trivial check of our new perturbation theory, we will now
prove that this is indeed the case for both the SG and the OSG, by working directly within
our new perturbation theory on the light-cone and up to the second perturbative order. Let
us resume the GLC gauge-fixing conditions to the first and second perturbative order:

10As a matter of fact, it is enough that g7” = const.
6) =0, 6 =0,
NO} 4 2aM =0, N®) — z(NOyP +2aM® — U2) =0 (A.4)
and the SG non-perturbative ones
?L +N 4 2M™ =0,

N = -aM™,

9 = — Lym
a

Then, inverting the light-cone metric (2.15), we can obtain g’” at first and second order in
perturbation theory before fixing any gauge, namely

= 22 LY NY — a@MONY 4 5 UOU +4 2eevVOVO + 2a7VOUM. (A.6)
Then, by fixing the GLC gauge we have L( =0, v\ =0 and 6 = 0, so we are left with

Iiauc) = —2aMM — NM =0,

GEauc) = —2aM) _ yy + 2aM@) — UA) — a[3a(M)? + 2MMON) + UA)

— 72am)? —a[3a(M)? — 4a(M)?] =0, (A.7)
as expected. On the other hand, fixing the light-cone counterpart of the SG, we have

Gisa) = —-7L — 2M — NM =0,

GEsc) = —(NM + 24M)? + 4am (NO + 2aM) — 3a?(M))?

+2NY(NO 4 2aM) — 242M NO)

= (NY)? 4.02(MM)? + 2aMONY = (A.8)
thus confirming that the observer defined by the OSG is free-falling as well as the one defined
by the SG.
