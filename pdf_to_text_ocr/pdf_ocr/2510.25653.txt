ABSTRACT

Context. Ultracompact Galactic binary systems emit low-frequency gravitational waves in the mHz regime. The emission of gravi-
tational waves is causing these systems to lose angular momentum, which is detectable by observing the decay of the orbital period
of the system. The system ZTFJ213056.71+442046.5 (ZTF J2130) is an ultracompact binary with a period of 39.3401(1) minutes
consisting of a Roche lobe-filling hot subdwarf and a white dwarf companion. It has an apparent brightness of G = 15.3 mag.

Aims. We attempt to measure the orbital decay rate P caused by gravitational wave emission of ZTF J2130 and predict the expected
gravitational wave signal for LISA.

Methods. High-speed photometry was conducted using the Finger-Lakes-Instrumentation Kepler KL4040FI Complemen-
tary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) camera, mounted to the 1.2-meter Oskar Liihning telescope at the Hamburg Observatory
as well as the Hamamatsu ORCA-Quest 2 qCMOS camera at the 1.23-meter telescope at the Centro Astronémico Hispano en An-
dalucia (CAHA) in Spain. ZTF J2130 was observed on six nights between August 2024 and September 2025. The obtained lightcurves
combined with previous high-cadence observations were used to conduct an O — C timing analysis. Additionally, we employed the
LISA data analysis tool LpAsorr to model the expected gravitational wave data.

Results. We measure a period change of (-1.97 + 0.05) x 107? ss“!. Assuming only gravitational wave emission, the period change
was used to calculate a chirp mass of (0.408 + 0.006) Mo. From Lpasorr we predict that LISA will be able to measure the chirp mass
with an uncertainty of ~ 5%.

Conclusions. This work measures the orbital decay with an uncertainty of only ~ 2% and shows that modern (q)CMOS detectors
are well suited to provide precise timing measurements, enabling the measurement of the orbital decay of compact Galactic binaries
with high precision even with modest size telescopes. The derived orbital decay is fully consistent with predictions from spectral and
lightcurve modeling, although the masses are not known with sufficient precision to measure any deviation of the orbital decay from
only gravitational waves. We show that future observations with L/SA can potentially provide a deviation from only gravitational wave
effects, e.g. due to accretion, if the effect is sufficiently large.

nary will shrink until the sdB fills its Roche lobe at a period of
= 30- 100 min, depending on the evolutionary stage and en-
velope thickness of the hot subwarf (e.g.

Neunteufel et al.|2019}|/Bauer & Kupfer}2021).

Upcoming space-based GW detectors, such as the Laser In-

terferometer Space Antenna LISA (Amaro-Seoane et al.]2023),
and TianQin (Luo et al.|/2016) will be sensitive to GW emis-

sion at mHz frequencies from ultracompact binaries. Detailed
simulations of Galactic binary populations find that LISA is ex-
pected to individually resolve GW signals from O(10*) Galac-
tic binaries, while upwards of O(10°) of these are also expected
to be identified and characterized through their electromagnetic
radiation as "multi-messenger" sources (Nelemans et al./[2004!
To date, approximately 43 LISA detectable binaries with orbital
periods Po:y»< 2hours have been characterized through their
electromagnetic radiation (see
and references therein). Currently, only five detached hot
subdwarf binaries with a WD companion are known to have

ing hot subdwarfs, ZTF J2055+4651 and ZTF J2130+4420, as
part of a high-cadence Galactic Plane survey using the Zwicky

orbital period of 56min, whereas ZTF J2130+4420 (hereafter

detectable binaries.
Based on the derived system parameters,
predict the rate of period change caused by the angular
momentum loss due to GW emission to be P = (—1.68 + 0.42) x
10-857}, Recently,[Antipin et al (2024) found an orbital decay
of P = (-2.66 + 0.62) x 10° ss! in ZTFJ2130, higher than
predicted by|Kupfer et al.|(2020a), and argued that the increased
rate of orbital decay leads to an almost twofold increase in the
expected signal-to-noise ratio for the observations of GWs from
this binary system with space laser interferometers.

In this paper, we present follow-up photometric observations
of ZTF J2130, obtained with the Oscar Liihning telescope at the
Hamburg observatory and the 1.23-m telescope at the Centro As-
tronédmico Hispano en Andalucia (CAHA), both equipped with
new CMOS detectors. We report the detection of a rapid orbital
decay rate in the system and discuss the orbital period change
in the context of expectations from general relativity. Section
[describes our observations and Section B] describes in detail
the O — C method which was used to measure the orbital decay
and the results we obtained. Section ]discusses the results with
respect to predictions from general relativity. We conclude and
summarize the paper in Section [5]

2. Observations

Observations were performed with the Oskar Liihning telescope
at the Hamburg Observatory and with the 1.23-meter telescope at
Calar Alto Observatory in Spain. The Oskar Liihning telescope
(OLT) is a 1.2 meter mirror Ritchey-Chretien Telescope with a
focal length of 15.60 m. It was built in 1975 and was funded by
the Liihning foundation. The telescope was mounted on a preex-
isting mount in a dome from 1954 at the Hamburg Observatory
in Hamburg-Bergedorf and remains one of Germany’s largest
optical telescopes (Hiinsch[2009). Since 2024, the telescope has
been operated with a new camera which uses a Contemporary
Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) sensor. This sensor type
has several advantages over Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) sen-
sors such as low read noise and a fast readout speed, as well as

lower costs and a lower power consumption (Smit et al./2025).

at the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), taken from|Deshmukh et al.|(2022). The new data points have been taken with the OLT in

Hamburg and the 1.23-meter telescope at CAHA in Spain.

In front of the camera, an eight-slot filter-wheel is mounted with
one slot being empty to allow observations without filter.

The new OLT camera used for the observations is a
Finger-Lakes-Instrumentation Kepler KL4040FI
CMOS camera with a detector size of 4096 x 4096 active pixels
and a pixel size of 9 x 9um. With the 8’ x 8’ field of view,
this yields a pixel scale of ~ 0.12 arcsec/pixel. The camera
uses a CMOS sensor. This sensor type has multiple advantages
over CCDs for high-speed photometry. The camera offers a
much faster readout speed than CCDs with up to 24 frames-per-
second. Compared to CCDs, the dark current of CMOS sensors
is generally higher and the readout noise is much lower. The
Kepler KL4040FI has a quoted readout noise of 3.7e~!. The
signal-to-noise ratio of a CMOS sensor can outperform CCD
detectors, especially for images with short exposure times
(2024). The fast readout and low readout noise are ideal for
photometric observations with short exposure times and high
timing precision even at modest size telescopes.

In addition, observations were taken with the Hamamatsu

ORCA-Quest 2 qCMOS camera mounted on the 1.23-meter
telescope at Calar Alto Observatory. The camera has a detector
size of 4096 x 2304 active pixels and a pixel size of 4.6 x 4.6 um.
The camera has a particularly low readout noise which has been
measured to be only 0.3e7! and a readout time of only 0.039 sec
(Krynski et al.|/2025). We observed using 4 x 4 binning. The
ocal length of the telescope is about 9870 mm. resulting in
a field of view of 6.6’ x 3.7’ and a pixel scale (unbinned) of
0.10 arcsec/pixel. ZTF J2130 was observed without filter on five
nights with the OLT and an exposure time of 10-20 sec as well
as on one additional night with the CAHA 1.23-meter telescope
and an exposure time of 2 sec, also without filter. The observa-
tions are summarized in Table[I]

For the OLT data, standard image calibration was conducted
following [Warner] (2006). Dark and flat frame calibration was
conducted using ten dark frames taken on each night with the
same exposure times and at the same temperatures as the sci-
ence frames. Ten twilight flat frames were taken on 5 May, 2024
without a filter and with an exposure time of 60 ms to reach an
average number of counts of 75% of the full well depth. To cre-
ate a master flat frame, 20 dark frames with the same exposure
time and the same temperature as the flat frames were also taken
on the same night. The resulting master flat frame was used to
calibrate all light frames. Image calibration was conducted using
a Python pipeline using standard astropy and ccdproc pack-
ages (Price- Whelan et al. 2022} Craig et al.[2023). A master dark
frame was subtracted from the science frames, and the science
frames were divided by a master flat frame. Due to the short ex-
posure time and the low noise of the Hamamatsu ORCA-Quest
2 camera, no dark subtraction was performed.

To extract lightcurves, differential photometry was con-
ducted using the HiPERCAM)| pipeline, which was slightly
modified to be able to extract data from both detectors used
in this work (Dhillon et al.[2021). It uses aperture photome-
try to get the flux of the object and a comparison star to get
the background-subtracted relative flux. The target aperture was
chosen to be 30 pixels and the aperture sizes were scaled with
the FWHM fit of the target. The GPS time stamps from both
telescopes were converted to barycentric dynamical time (TDB).
Example lightcurves from both telescopes are shown in Fig [I]

3. O — C Timing Analysis

To measure the period change of ZTFJ2130 due to GW emis-
sion, we took the approach of an observed-minus-calculated
(O — C) analysis. This analysis uses the accumulation of the pe-
riod change over a long baseline to enable the detection of a
small period change (Kepler et al-[T991)p.

To determine the secondary mid-eclipse time To, or the time
of inferior conjunction of the sdOB, where the WD is eclipsed by

the sdOB, we used the lightcurve modeling code LcuRVE

perwheat et al./2010). The code uses grids of points to model the
two stars. The shape of the stars in the binary is set by a Roche
potential. We assume that the orbit is circular and the rotation
periods of the stars are synchronized to the orbital period. The
flux that each point on the grid emits is calculated by assuming a
blackbody of a certain temperature at the bandpass wavelength,
corrected for limb darkening, gravity darkening, Doppler beam-
ing, and the reflection effect. We used an MCMC method im-

plemented in the emcee package (Foreman-Mackey et al.|2013)

for the To fit. All other parameters for LcuRvE were taken from

and [Deshmukh etal (2022). The derived

mid-eclipse times 7,.ps are presented in the second column in

Tab[2] Additionally, we include mid-eclipse times from [Desh-]
(2022) taken with high-speed-photometry exclud-

ing observations from large scale surveys (e.g. ZTF or ATLAS)

where data has been taken at random times over a longer period.
To determine the period change from the observed-minus-

calculated values, we need an expression for O — C including a

P term. The resulting equation is derived as follows.

The observed To,p; is assumed to follow the ephemeris equation

(1)

with the true (not observed!) reference mid-eclipse time Eo,true,
the true period Po true at Eo,true and the epoch (number of cycles)
E. Note that Eojtrue has units of time and E(t) is an integer. As-
suming that the period is slowly changing over time, Equation
can now be expanded using a Taylor-expansion at E = 0:

To,ovs(E) = Eo.true + PotrueE

Since we do not know the true values, we have to use the ob-
served values here because we want to calculate an unknown
quantity.
We use the ephemeris equation for the calculated mid-eclipse
time with the values of[Deshmukh et al.](2022) of
Tocaie = Eo,obs + PobsE

= 2458672.68085911(8) + 0.0273195159(7) x E.

The true values are unknown to us, but we can estimate the dif-
ference between the true and the observed value with the uncer-

tainty of the measured quantities 6E9 and 6Po. So we can write
Equation (6) as

(8)

According to this equation, an O — C # 0 could indicate the
following things:

1 .
O-C =6E) +6PoE + 5 PeuePineE”.

1. A constant vertical offset indicates a difference between the

true and the observed mid-eclipse time at E = 0.
2. A linear trend with constant slope indicates a difference be-

tween the true and the observed period.
3. A quadratic trend might indicate a constant rate of change in

period P # 0.

The goal of this analysis is to find values for the true period and
the period change. This can be achieved by fitting Equation ®)
to the data, so for every measured To ops, the O— C residual must
be determined.

To get an O—C value from the data, the calculated value with the
assumption of no period change has to be calculated, using the
ephemeris equation (i). Therefore, the number of cycles since
Eowrue is needed. Assuming JEy9 < Pie, this number can be
determined by dividing the time difference between the observed
reference mid-eclipse time and the observed mid-eclipse time by
the observed period:

To,0bs — Eo,obs (9)
Pops ,

The result of Equation ) is rounded to the nearest integer value.

Equation (i) is now used to calculate the observed (O) minus
calculated (C) time difference:

O- C = To, bs — Eo,obs — Po,obsE-
The resulting O — C measurements are shown in Tab.
We now determine the period change by fitting Equation ®)
to the values in TableP2] All parameters in the equation are fitted,
except for the period. The Python module emcee is used to fit
an MCMC with Gaussian priors (Foreman-Mackey et al 2013}.
Since we do not expect significant errors for the reference mid-
eclipse time and the period, these priors are chosen to be 0. The
boundaries for the priors are the uncertainties for these quantities

from|Deshmukh et al.|(2022). The result of the fit is
P = (-1.972 + 0.047) x 107? ss“.

The fit is shown in Figure 2Jalong with the prediction by
(2020a) and the measured value from{Antipin et al.](2024).

4. Discussion

4.1. Comparison to prediction and previous measurements

(2024) combined data from the Zwicky Tran-

sient Facility with data taken during several nights between
April 2023 and August 2024 with the RC600 telescope at the
Caucasus Mountain Observatory. Using 17 minima over a to-
tal of 6.5 years, they find an orbital decay of P = (—2.66 +
0.62) x 10-!? ss“!. This value is broadly consistent, within the
error limits, with predictions from [Kupfer et al (2020a) (Pe
(—1.68 + 0.42) x 107!? ss~!) which are based on the system pa-
rameters derived from spectroscopic and lightcurve modeling
assuming angular momentum loss only from GW radiation. Al-
though Antipin et al 2024) argue that their measured P leads to
an almost twofold increase in the expected signal-to-noise ratio
for the observations of GWs with LISA.

We measure P = (1.972 + 0.047) x 107!” ss“! which is fully
consistent with the predictions from [Kupfer et al.] (2020a). De-
spite the similar baseline of timing measurements used in this
work (~ 6.5 years), our uncertainty on P is significantly smaller
than the value measured by {Antipin et al.] (2024). This is due
to both the higher SNR and the higher time resolution of our
photometry as compared to the ZTF photometry, which domi-
nated their fit. ZTF observed the source irregularly with a low
cadence over a longer time frame and used a 30sec exposure
time. Their individual uncertainty for each O — C measurement
is ~ 4—5sec. Our analysis only includes lightcurves that have
been taken continuously with a high cadence of 2 sec to 20sec,
leading to an uncertainty of < 1 sec for each O — C measure-
ment, significantly smaller compared to [Antipin et al.] (2024).
This shows the importance of high cadence observations with lit-
tle to no readout loss for precise timing measurements. Our work
shows that modern (q)CMOS detectors even at modest size tele-
scopes can lead to excellent timing precision needed for precise
P measurements. Overall, we measure a P with an uncertainty
of only 2 %, which is fully consistent with the predictions from
{Kupfer et al.] (2020a). Future observations are expected to de-
crease the uncertainty on P even more. With simulated O — C
values, following Equation ®) and scattered with the typical un-
certainty for our measurements (~ 1 sec), we could reach a P
uncertainty of ~ 0.5 % after 5 more years of observation, assum-
ing ~ 4 observations per year.

4.2. Predictions for future space based GW detectors

At present, projects of space laser interferometers aimed at ob-
serving mHz GWs, for example, TianQin (2016) and
the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA;
{et al] (2023)), are being developed. ZTF J2130 has an orbital pe-
riod of 39 min and is expected to radiate GWs in the mHz fre-
quency regime. Galactic binaries with well-measured properties
are ideal sources for combined electromagnetic and GW multi-
messenger studies. In particular, multi-messenger observations
can distinguish between the orbital decay coming from GWs and
tidal effects or accretion. Assuming an orbital decay only due to
angular momentum loss from GWs, we can calculate the chirp
mass from

im

with f being the GW frequency and f being the change in fre-
quency due to angular momentum loss from GW radiation. Us-
ing our measured orbital decay, combined with the GW fre-

quency of f = 0.8474Hz we find a chirp mass of M. =
0.408 + 0.006 Mo. Note that this chirp mass assumes angular mo-
mentum loss only from GW radiation, therefore in the case that
other effects such as tides or accretion significantly contribute to
the orbital decay, this chirp mass would not correspond to the ac-
tual chirp mass of the binary. From the mass measurements from

Kupfer et al.|(2020a) we can calculate the actual chirp mass fol-

lowing

_ (mms

fe (12)
where m, and mp are the individual masses of the binary. We
find a value of M, = 0.37 + 0.04Mo. This is fully consistent
with the chirp mass from the P we measured. However, we do
not know the masses of the binary well enough from optical ob-
servations to understand if the orbital decay of ZTF J2130 differs
from only GW radiation. Tidal effects and accretion predict up
to 10% deviation from GW radiation (Fuller & LaiJ2011|

If GW measurements are in hand, we can derive the actual
chirp mass following

hetd

maron| me

where / is the strain amplitude from GW measurements, f is the
GW frequency, and d is the distance. The latter two are mea-
sured from electromagnetic measurements. As Equation[11] as-
sumes orbital decay only from GWs, any deviation of the chirp
mass derived with Equation|!1|from the chirp mass derived with
Equation[13] points to additional factors in the loss of angular
momentum, e.g. due to tidal forces or accretion.

To predict the expected GW signal and the corresponding
chirp mass from LISA and test if we will be able to distinguish an
orbital decay only from GWs or additional factors, we employed
the parallel-tempered Markovy_Chain Monte Carlo algorithm.
ucB_Mcmc within the Loasor | package
2025). The sky position and orbital period were fixed, while a

yaussian prior was applied to the distance of d = 1.20+0.06 kpc,
which was determined from the Gaia parallax, and a uniform
prior was applied to the orbital inclination of i = 86.4 + 1.0 deg,
both taken from|Kupfer et al.](2020a).

The simulation uses an estimated astrophysical foreground
from the unresolved Galactic binaries as described in [Cornish]
[& Robson] (2017). We ran the simulation for 48 months, con-

sistent with the nominal operation time for LISA. Following the
definition in Sec. 4 in [Kupfer et al. (2024), which states that a
source is detected in LJSA when the posterior distribution shows
a closed contour, we predict that the source will be detected af-
ter 48 months adding ZTF J2130 to the list of detectable LISA
sources. Using Equation[13] we find that LISA will be able to
measure the chirp mass with an uncertainty of + 5%.

5. Conclusions and Summary

In this work, we present follow-up high-speed photom-
etry observations of the ultracompact mass _ transferring
sdOB+WD binary ZTFJ2130. Using high-cadence obser-
vations obtained with the 1.2m OLT equipped with the
Finger-Lakes-Instrumentation Kepler KL4040FI

telescope equipped with the Hamamatsu ORCA-Quest 2
qCMOS detector at CAHA combined with data taken with
HiPERCAM and the Nordic Optical telescope we detected an
orbital decay of the binary. Using the O — C method, we find an
orbital decay of P = (—1.972 + 0.047) x 107!” ss“! which is fully
consistent with predictions from spectroscopy and lightcurve
modeling assuming angular momentum loss only from GWs.
After about 6.5 years of data taking, our P uncertainty is
x 2% which is predicted to decrease to < 1% with additional
observations over the next five years. This shows that modern
(q)CMOS detectors with low readout noise and virtually no
dead time between exposures are well suited for precise timing
measurements of compact Galactic binaries even at modest size
telescopes.

Currently, the masses of the binary are not known with suffi-
cient precision to detect any deviation of the orbital decay from
only GWs. We employed Lpasorr to predict the GW signal from
LISA. Combined with the distance and inclination from

we calculate the expected uncertainty on the chirp

mass from future LISA observations and find an expected uncer-
tainty of only 5%. Therefore, any significant deviation of GW
angular momentum loss due to e.g. accretion could potentially
be detected with future LISA observations as long as the effect is
sufficiently large.
