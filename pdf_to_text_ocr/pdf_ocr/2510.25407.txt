band-gap crystals to interpret time-resolved emission

We investigate the spontaneous emission of light in three-dimensional (3D) photonic crystals
through theoretical calculations and simulations. It is well known that spontaneous emission depends
on the radiative local density of states (RLDOS). Photonic band-gap crystals radically modulate
the RLDOS, thereby controlling spontaneous emission. We compare two different methods to cal-
culate the RLDOS: the plane-wave expansion (PWE) method and the finite-difference time-domain
(FDTD) method. The PWE method directly calculates the RLDOS of an infinite photonic crystal,
whereas the FDTD method simulates the RLDOS through the power emitted by a dipole in a finite
photonic crystal. We demonstrate that the methods yield similar frequency-dependent trends in the
RLDOS, with relative differences of less than 12% that originate from the different boundary condi-
tions. We employ the plane-wave expansion method to compute distributions of emission rates that
are relevant to many optical experiments where quantum emitters are distributed within a crystal.

Such distributions of emission rates enable us to compute and directly interpret the time-resolved
decay as observed in experiments. We expect that our results promote the RLDOS to the realm of

optical design and products.

I. INTRODUCTION

Spontaneous emission is the fundamental process be-
hind almost all light sources 2], and is typically
well described in the dipole approximation [3]. Three-
dimensional (3D) photonic band-gap crystals are eagerly
pursued for their potential to inhibit or enhance the spon-
taneous emission [4}H8]. Photonic crystals are periodic di-
electric materials, where the periodicity is on the scale of
the wavelength of light [9]. The rate of spontaneous emis-
sion, i.e., the radiative decay rate, of a rotating dipole
located at a position rp emitting at a frequency w is
given by Fermi’s golden rule [10] that is reformulated

in nanophotonics as [I] [TH16) [17],

TW
3heo

Trad (t0,) = |PI?.N (r0,w) , (1)

where €o is the permittivity of free space, P the transition
dipole moment, and N(ro,w) the radiative local density
of states (RLDOS) [18]. Photonic crystals enhance or
inhibit spontaneous emission because their states, Bloch
modes, are different from the modes in free space, thus
modifying N(ro,w).
Multiple numerical methods are used to calculate the
decay rate. The plane wave expansion (PWE) method
computes the RLDOS in an infinite photonic crystal
without boundaries [7] [16] [19422], obtaining the de-
cay rate through Eq. The numerical finite-difference
time-domain (FDTD) method simulates the emission
of a dipole in a finite photonic crystal with bound-
aries [23}26], obtaining the decay rate through the emit-
ted power [23] [27]. Remarkably, to the best of our knowl-
edge, these popular methods have not yet been compared
to date, especially in the case of 3D photonic crystals.

Furthermore, current emission calculations in photonic
crystals cannot be directly compared to many emission
experiments. Emission measurements often probe the
ime-resolved decay curve f(t) of a large ensemble of
emitters distributed at many positions in a 3D photonic
crystal [8] (28}39], where f(t) is the number of detected
hhotons per time bin in experiments. The RLDOS has
een calculated before in photonic crystals with various
structures with the goal to interpret spontaneous emis-
sion experiments in photonic crystals [16] [T9}{22] [24}26).
However, most of these studies describe the emission by
only one emitter at only one or a few positions inside a
3D photonic crystal [16] {19} [20) [22] [24] [26]. While Wang
et al. do consider multiple emitter positions [21], calcu-
ating f(t) from their calculated distributions of lifetimes

is difficult [40].

Here, we perform new calculations on the RLDOS
with the goal of interpreting spontaneous emission ex-
eriments. In the first part, we compute the RLDOS at
a single position in (A) two different types of 3D pho-
onic crystal structures, and (B) using the PWE and
FDTD methods. We demonstrate that the two meth-
ods yield RLDOSs in both photonic crystals of which the
rends agree well, but also that the methods differ in de-
ails due to the presence or absence of finite-size effects.
n the second part, we calculate the RLDOS at many
specific emitter positions using the PWE method, effec-
ively in the same computational time as RLDOS calcu-
ations at a single position, similar to Wang et al. [21].
We use this ensemble of RLDOSs relative to a reference
RLDOS to calculate the decay curve of the whole en-
semble of emitters present at these many positions. The
decay curve is directly obtained in previously mentioned
experiments via time-correlated single-photon counting
measurements [41].

Il. METHODS

A. Structures

We study two different 3D photonic crystal structures
to verify the robustness of our results: a face-centered
cubic (fcc) colloidal crystal without a band gap, and an
inverse-woodpile crystal with a 3D band gap, as shown
in Fig.[1] The fcc colloidal crystal has been studied often
to test local density of states calculations [16 {19} [22].
Using the fec unit cell from Ref. [9], the fcc lattice has
a cubic lattice parameter a = 680 nm, with spheres with
€ = 7.35 (typical for TiOg, set constant as a function of
w) and a sphere volume fraction of 25%. The sphere is
positioned at (0,0,0) inside the unit cell and is repeated
by the primitive lattice vectors. The interstitial space is
filled with a dielectric medium with ¢ = 1.77, typical of
water.

The second photonic crystal we investigate features
the cubic diamond-like inverse woodpile structure with
a complete photonic band gap [42], as studied in various
experiments [8} [39] [43] [44][45]. The structure contains
pores of n = 1.48 (€ * 2.19 as is typical for toluene,
diameter dpore = 245 nm, pitch a = 680 nm) with a back-
bone of ¢ = 12.1 (typical for silicon). The pore along
the x direction is positioned at (0, rod £), along the y
direction at (0,0,0), repeated by lattice vectors of the
body-centered tetragonal lattice, see Ref. (44).

B.  Finite-difference time-domain method

With the FDTD method, we simulate a dipole emitter
at position rg with a dipole moment oriented in direction
eq to calculate the emitted power from which the partial
RLDOS, Np(ro,w,ea), is derived. The partial RLDOS
is equal to the RLDOS in the direction of the dipole

moment ey [I], and is given by [23]

Np(r0,w, ea) = * P(r0,0, 64,04): (2)
where P(rp,w,eg) is the emitted power of the dipole.
To calculate the RLDOS, we use the open-source FDTD
software package MEEP [46]. The FDTD method time
steps the electromagnetic fields in real space, (t,r). The
fields are absorbed by a perfectly matched layer of 1.4m
around the photonic crystal, mimicking free space. The
output power is recorded and the partial RLDOS is cal-
culated by internal functions in MEEP. The RLDOS is
found by summing the partial RLDOS obtained from
simulations along three orthogonal directions (ez, ey,
e.) [14], ie, N(ro,w) = Np(r0,w, ex) + Np(r0,w, ey) +
Np(¥o,w, ez).
Similar to experiments, the crystals under study are
finite; thus, crystal surfaces are intrinsically present.
While unavoidable defects may be considered, this is not
ypically done as it places a large burden on computa-
ional efforts.

C. Plane-wave expansion method

The PWE method computes the modes and frequen-
cies of a photonic crystal in the frequency domain by ex-
anding the periodic dielectric function (the scattering
otential) and the Bloch modes in a “ of reciprocal
attice vectors in wave vector space (w,k). Inherently,
he PWE method considers an infinite tom crystal.
Thus, neither external crystal surfaces are considered,
nor any unavoidable deviations from perfect periodicity,
such as point defects.

We use the open-source PWE package MIT Photonic
Bands [47] to calculate the electric fields E; (ro,w;) and
requencies w; of the Bloch modes in the photonic crys-
als. Due to the periodicity, all modes are obtained by
sampling the modes at k-vectors in the top half of the
first Brillouin zone [16] [22]. The RLDOS is calculated by
a weighted counting of the available modes [I] Tite

N (r0,w =) (w — w;) |Ei (ro, wil, (3)

where the weights are the electric fields normalized ac-
cording to

[wr (r,w;) - BE, (r,w;)d?r = bigs (4)

where 6;,; is the Kronecker delta function and V the vol-
ume of the unit cell.

D. RLDOS at many positions

So far, we have considered the emission of a single emit-
ter at a single position ro. However, multiple emitters are
often probed simultaneously in experiments, and these
emitters may be distributed inhomogeneously through-
out the crystal at positions {r} within the unit cell. The
PWE method allows us to calculate the RLDOS at these
positions, N({r},w), using Eq. [3] The calculation takes
hardly any extra time because E,(r,w;) is already ob-
tained when calculating the RLDOS at ro. The RLDOS
at each r is converted to a decay rate through Eq.

E. Analytical reference RLDOS in a homogeneous
medium

The RLDOS in a homogeneous medium does not de-
pend on position and can be calculated analytically.
Therefore, homogeneous media serve as an excellent ref-
erence. The radiative local density of states in a homoge-
neous medium with refractive index n is equal to [I] [49]

n 6
Nnhom,n(w) dw = Pas w* dw, (5)

where w is the angular frequency and co the speed of
light in vacuum. We rewrite the RLDOS as a function of
various frequency measures as

a An a?
Nnom,n ) du = (=) B dw (6)
a a 8rn\ a? a
Nnom,n ) a(+) = (=) <4(5) (7)
Nhom,n(2) dd = 8rnv? di, (8)

where a is the (fictitious) pitch, A the wavelength of light
in vacuum, and vy = Pearl = t the wavenumber. The
local density of states is sometimes reported in arbitrary
units, see e.g. Refs. [18] [19] [21], which unfortunately
does not provide much information to use or reproduce
the data. In other cases, e.g. Ref. [16], Ss Bes used
which is not practical because it mixes two different fre-
quency scales. Equation [7] gives the RLDOS in purely
reduced frequencies, which is convenient for theoretical
studies. We prefer the experimental scale wavenumber
i (50), which yields the simple Eq. 8]for the RLDOS with
units cem~?. Both computational methods in this paper
have been tested with various homogeneous media, and
they always agree very well with Eq. iS}

Because the RLDOS does not depend on position,
there is just a single decay rate Teg according to
Eq. [I}-assuming all emitters are the same. The single-
exponential reference decay curve is equal to

fret (t) = AretT rere", (9)

where Ayer is the amplitude, experimentally the number
of counts at arrival time t = 0.

F. RLDOS distributions to calculate the decay
curve

Experiments probe the decay curve f(t) through time-
correlated single-photon counting, where f(t) is a his-
ogram of photon arrival times that are collected upon
repeated excitation in a time-correlated single-photon
counting experiment [4]]. The decay curve of emitters
in the photonic crystal fpnc(t) = f(t) at a wavenumber
D. is compared to a reference decay curve frep(t) at H%
o calculate the enhancement. Our computational ap-
roach is similar: We calculate the decay curve f(t) at
v, of many emitters inhomogeneously distributed at po-
sitions {r} in a photonic crystal, relative to a decay curve
in a homogeneous reference medium fye¢(t) at He.

From calculations, we know the RLDOSs at the

ositions of the emitters {r} in the photonic crystal
Nonc({t}, 2) = N({r},0) (Sec. and_the RLDOS
in the reference medium Nye¢(7) (Sec. ITE). The rel-
ative RLDOSs are obtained by dividing N({r},7) by
Nrep(v). We construct a normalized histogram of the
relative RLDOSs in a narrow wavenumber regime Av
centered around 7:

0 (eer) =°(am) 2

For simplicity assuming all emitters are equal and have

a quantum efficiency of 100%, p (#5) is equal to the

distribution of relative decay rates p (4) using Eq [|
Using the fact that Dyer is known from the decay curve
fret (t) (see Eq. Dp). we calculate the distribution of decay
rates in the photonic crystal, p([). Finally, we compute
he distribution

CL) = AT p(T), (11)

which relates to the decay curve f(t) via the Laplace
ransform

1) = [° cryexo{-ryar, (12)

When the number of excited emitters is the same in the
photonic crystal as in the reference, the amplitude A
equals Ayer.

Ill. RESULTS
A. Colloidal crystal at a single position

We calculate the radiative local density of states (RL-
DOS) inside the fcc colloidal crystal at position (4, $,0)
using two different methods. We first turn to the plane
wave expansion method in F (red). For this calcu-
lation, we use 1728 plane waves, and 3456 k-points in
the top half of the first Brillouin zone [22]. These and

the following quantities are chosen as a trade-off between
accuracy and computation time. The results of PWE cal-
culations by Nikolaev et al. [16] (black) are also shown,
who use more k-points (59520) but fewer plane waves
(965). The peaks and troughs in the RLDOS match
closely, giving an error Li(y1,y2) = mean(|y2 — yi|) of
I, = 4x 108 cm~?, which is 9x smaller than the mean
RLDOS. As discussed by Nikolaev et al., who compare
their results to Ref. [22], small differences are expected,
especially given the differences in the number of k-points
and plane waves. Therefore, we conclude that our PWE
method agrees well with the literature.

In addition, we simulate the RLDOS at the same posi-
tion as the PWE method within a 6a x 6a x 6a colloidal
photonic crystal using the FDTD method with a resolu-
tion of 25 pixels per a. The FDTD method exhibits a few
sharp peaks, which we attribute to the finite size of the
sample and the presence of surfaces. The trends of the
RLDOS obtained by the FDTD and PWE method agree
well with a relatively small error of Ly = 7 x 108 cm~?.
Therefore, our calculations show that determining the
RLDOS through the FDTD or PWE method is nearly
equivalent in the studied 6a x 6a x 6a colloidal photonic
crystal.

We also calculate the RLDOS of two homogeneous me-
dia using Eq. | in a (black dashed), namely water
(Clow = 1.77) and TiO (Enign = 7.35), the materials from
which the photonic crystal is made. At low wavenumbers,
v < 7000cm~! (% < 0.48), the increase in the RLDOS
of the photonic crystal is parabolic, similar to that of a
homogeneous medium. Fitting Eq. 3 we find that the
crystal behaves as an effective homogeneous medium for
the RLDOS with ¢ = 6.1 up to = 7000cm™!. It is re-
markable that the effective ¢ of the homogeneous medium

We observe that at greater wavenumbers, the RL-
DOS in the photonic crystal oscillates between the
low and high dielectric RLDOS, i.e., Nhom,water(7) S
Npnc(¥o,7) S Nnom,rio, (7). The RLDOS is converted
o a decay rate of a fast-rotating emitter using Eq. [I] We
find that the decay rate of this emitter at ro inside the
hhotonic crystal compared to that in a reference medium
with dielectric constant erer, ['/Tyer, will not be much
greater than the enhancement of decay rate reached when
he emitter is in a homogeneous medium of épign relative

in this photonic crystal, relative to a reference medium

B. Inverse woodpile crystal at a single position

We calculate the RLDOS in a 3D photonic band-gap
crystal with an inverse woodpile structure at position
(0, Eat §) Le., furthest away from silicon, at the center
of the crossing between two pores. For the PWE method,
we use 6886 k-points and 1728 plane waves. The FDTD
simulation simulates a structure of size 6c x 6c x 6a, where
c=a/V2, using a grid with 27000 voxels per a’.

The trends of the PWE calculation and FDTD simu-
lation in Fig. [3] resemble each other closely; the strong
peaks and troughs obtained through the different meth-
ods nicely overlap, giving an error of Ly = 4 x 108 cm~?,
or L;/mean(N(ro,7)) < 12%. However, there appears

to be speckle (‘grass’) modulated on top of the FDTD
results. The speckle becomes sharper as the resolu-
tion increases and the FDTD simulation runs longer.
Therefore, the speckle does not originate from numeri-
cal noise; instead, we attribute it to surface effects that
are only present in the FDTD method: waves emitted
by the dipole are reflected at the boundary of the pho-
tonic crystal. Intuitively, reflections at the boundary
may be stronger in an inverse structure—like the inverse
woodpile—than in the direct colloidal structure defined
above. Other than the speckle, the most significant rela-
tive difference in RLDOS between the methods occurs in
the photonic band gap, where the RLDOS is absolutely
zero for the PWE method, but at a minimum N(v =
5600cm~') = 1.1 x 10°cm~? for the FDTD method.
The RLDOS in the finite-size photonic crystal is 10 times
lower than Nhom,toluene at the same wavenumber, which
is consistent with Ref. [26] because we simulate a larger
photonic crystal.

Just like the RLDOS of the TiO2 spheres in water,
N(ro, 7) at low wavenumbers is mainly determined by the
high-e material, here silicon, while ro is in the low-e ma-
terial. Here, we do observe that an enhancement higher
than in homogeneous high-e material is possible, namely
just above the band gap. Apparently, the modes absent
in the band gap are pushed towards higher wavenumbers.
Further above the band gap, just like at the probed posi-
tion in the TiO spheres in water, N(ro,/) remains lower
than the homogeneous RLDOS Nz nign(7).

C. Position-averaged RLDOS of the inverse
woodpile photonic crystal

The 3D photonic band-gap crystal with the inverse
woodpile structure consists of toluene-filled pores in sil-
icon. In experiments, quantum dot emitters are present
at many positions in the pores, while they cannot reside
within the silicon backbone. To calculate the average
RLDOS in the pores, we use the same Bloch modes of
the photonic crystal with an inverse-woodpile structure
that we calculated in the previous section. Of each of
those computed Bloch modes, we extract the normalized
electric field at 13824 positions, where the electric field
grid is doubled in each dimension via interpolation. At
each position in the pores, we compute the RLDOS us-
ing Eq. The average RLDOS inside the pores of the
inverse woodpile photonic crystal and its standard de-
viation are shown in Fig. We discern that particular
features in the RLDOS are not random but instead occur
at many positions inside the pores, such as the peaks just
after the photonic band gap and at 7 = 9400cm~!. We
also observe these features in the RLDOS calculated at
a single position in Fig.

D. Decay curve in the pores of the inverse
woodpile photonic crystal

We turn to the computation of the distribution ¢(T)
and the decay curve f(t) for positions inside the pores
of the photonic crystal with an inverse woodpile struc-
ture. As in many experiments, the calculations of ¢(T)
and f(t) in the photonic crystal are relative to a de-
cay curve in a homogeneous reference medium (here
n = 1.48). We choose a reference decay curve of
fret (t) = ArerM rer exp{—T ert} and corresponding ¢(I) =
Azetl ret5(P — Tree) with Arep = 1 and Pre = 1 pst, see
the black dotted lines in Fig and ph, respectively.
For simplicity, we assume 100% quantum efficiency, i.e.,
the non-radiative decay rate is zero, and this can be gen-
eralized to any realistic quantum emitter.

We compute ¢(I) inside the photonic crystal pores in
Fig. [BIA i in two wavenumber intervals: jst above the pho-
tonic band gap in 7 = 6500 + 100cm™? (red solid), and
further above the band gap in 7 = 9200+ 100cm~! (blue
dashed). We observe average enhancements in rates [
of 3.3x and 1.7x relative to the reference, respectively.
As expected from Fig. A just above the band gap at 7 =

6500 cm~! the average enhancement i
distribution is broad, while further
at 9200cm~!, the enhancement is

istributed over the pores of an inverse woodpile pho-
tonic crystal. At both 6500 and 9200cm™', the re-
sulting slopes differ greatly from linear trends on the
semi-logarithmic scale, and therefore, decay is strongly
non-single-exponential, as has been experimentally ob-
served [31] [34] [35]. In the first few microseconds, the
slope of the photonic crystal decay traces is steep due
to the high decay rates present in ¢(I). In contrast, in
the last few microseconds, the reference’s slope is steeper
than the photonic crystal’s because the ¢(I) is non-zero
at [T <Tyer. The slower decay in the last few microsec-
onds is challenging to observe experimentally because the
signal is small, which will require a substantial signal-to-
noise ratio: f(t = 7ps)/f(t = 0) ~ 1074. We note that
the time integrals of the curves in Fig. BB are all the same
because in time-correlated single-photon counting exper-
iments with emitters that have 100% quantum efficiency,
each emitter will eventually radiatively decay.

In experiments, obtaining the distribution ¢(I) from
f(t) is difficult because it requires an inverse Laplace

ransform. A common approach to finding ¢([) is to
fit f(t) with a function that preferably has few free pa-
rameters, a known inverse Laplace transform, fits many
decay curves well, and approaches zero as t + oo. We
observe that our ¢(I) distributions in Fig. have a rela-
ively steep edge at low I’ and a more gentle edge at high
[. Therefore, the main peak in the C(I’) distribution is
reasonably well described by a log-normal distribution,
which has only three free parameters, a known Laplace
ransform, and goes to zero when t — oo [BJ]. It has al-
ready been experimentally observed that the log-normal
distribution fits the decay curve of an ensemble of emit-
ers in 3D photonic crystals very well [34]; we now also
ave an understanding of why.

Iv. CONCLUSION

We have calculated the radiative decay rate in 3D
photonic crystals using two different methods: weighted
counting of Bloch modes via plane-wave expansion
(PWE) and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) sim-
ulations of the power emitted by a dipole. The methods
agree well. The slight differences are attributed to the
finite-size and surface effects that are present in FDTD,
but absent in PWE. Furthermore, we used the PWE
method to calculate the decay curve of an ensemble of
emitters distributed inhomogeneously in a 3D photonic
band-gap crystal.

Our computations provide new insights into what to
expect in experiments. For example, we have provided
an upper bound to the enhancement in decay rate: the
enhancement is not much larger than one would obtain
using a homogeneous medium of the high refractive in-
dex material present in the photonic crystal, except at
frequencies just above a 3D band gap.

The results for stationary rotating dipoles can be ex-
tended to stationary non-rotating dipoles by also consid-
ering the dipole orientation in Eq. Furthermore, the
speckle in FDTD simulations can be reduced by using
a sphere-shaped structure instead of the box-shaped one
we used here. Lastly, while our results focus on the de-
cay curve, the enhancement and inhibition of the emitted
power of an ensemble of emitters in a photonic crystal can
also be obtained by considering non-radiative decay.

40] While the relation between decay rate and lifetime is sim-
ple for a single emitter, the relation between distribu-
tions of lifetimes and decay rates of an ensemble of emit-
ters that have varying decay rates is complex. Therefore,
Eq. cannot directly be applied when using distribu-
tions of lifetimes ¢(T) instead of decay rates ¢(I).
