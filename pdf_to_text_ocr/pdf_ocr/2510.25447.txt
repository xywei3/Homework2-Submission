Abstract

Although the chaotic nature of the atmosphere may enable efficient control of tropical
cyclones (TCs) via small-scale perturbations, few studies have proposed data-driven
optimization methods to identify such perturbations. Here, we apply the recently
proposed Ensemble Kalman Control (EnKC) to a TC simulation. We show that EnKC
finds small-scale perturbations that mitigate TC. An EnKC-estimated reduction in surface
water vapor, located approximately 250km from the TC center, suppresses convective
activity and latent heat release in the eye wall, leading to a reduction of TC intensity. To
advance the discovery of feasible TC mitigation strategies, we discuss the potential of this

data-driven method for leveraging chaos, as well as its remaining challenges.

Plain Language Summary

Tropical cyclones are chaotic systems, which means that small changes to the atmosphere
might change how strong they become. We tested an approach called Ensemble Kalman
Control that searches for the effective “small tweaks” to weaken a storm in a realistic
weather model. Our method found useful tweaks that act over small areas. The most
effective change was to slightly reduce the amount of water vapor near the ocean surface
about 250 kilometers from the storm’s center. This reduces activities of the tall
thunderstorms and the release of heat in the ring of tall clouds, which in turn lowered the
storm’s intensity. Our results suggest that targeted and data-driven interventions could

someday help limit cyclone damage. However, they also highlight practical challenges.

Key points
We propose a novel data-driven, or top-down, method to identify perturbations to mitigate
tropical cyclones.

Our method effectively leverages chaotic nature of the atmosphere to control the system.
1. Introduction

On 16 September 1961, an aircraft carrying eight canisters of silver iodide flew into the
eyewall of Tropical Cyclone (TC) Esther to conduct cloud seeding. Another aircraft
subsequently observed a reduction in kinetic energy near the eyewall after the seeding.
This marked the beginning of mankind’s attempts to mitigate TCs. Although the effect of
cloud seeding on TC intensity was not confirmed as robust during Project STORMFURY
(1962-1981) (Willoughby et al. 1985), many subsequent simulation-based studies have
explored alternative TC mitigation methods, such as offshore wind turbines (Jacobson et
al. 2014), power-generating sailing ships (Horinouchi and Mitsuyuki 2023), aerosol
injection (Zhang et al. 2007; Cotton et al. 2007; Tran et al. 2025), and sea surface cooling
to reduce evaporation (Latham et al. 2012; Hlywiak and Nolan 2022; Oceantherm 2025)
(see Miller et al. (2023) for a comprehensive review).

It is very likely that the atmosphere is a chaotic system characterized by strong sensitivity
to small perturbations. In such systems, small control interventions can dramatically alter
future states, potentially enabling highly efficient control. This concept of chaos control
has been investigated across many scientific disciplines (Shinbrot et al. 1993), and some
meteorologists have noted its potential for weather modification (Hoffman, 2002;
Henderson et al. 2005). However, most previous studies on the modifications of TC and
other weather systems did not explicitly consider or leverage this sensitivity to small
perturbations. Moreover, this same sensitivity limits predictability. Thus, the atmosphere
presents a dual nature of both controllability and unpredictability, and it is generally
difficult to control unpredictable systems. Previous studies have not fully addressed this
dilemma, as they relied on “perfect model” experiments, in which one simulation with no
control force was treated as a truth despite their longer simulation period than a
predictability limit and compared with a controlled counterpart. In other words, previous
works assessed the controllability of the atmosphere assuming infinite predictability. In
these “perfect model” experiments, small-scale perturbations which leverage chaos

cannot be robustly found.

Miyoshi and Sun (2022) proposed a useful framework to assess the controllability of the
atmosphere by leveraging its chaotic nature. Their contributions were twofold. First, they
introduced the Control Simulation Experiment (CSE) as an extension of the well-known
Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE; Amold and Dey 1986; Hoffman and
Atlas 2016). In a CSE, a synthetic “nature run” is generated by simulation. Observations

derived from this nature run are assimilated into a model estimate of the system state.
Then, based on this state estimate by data assimilation, a controller estimates appropriate
interventions and adds them to the nature run. Although the nature run is generated by
simulation, it is inaccessible to the controller, who must act under finite predictability
imposed by data assimilation. CSE is useful to analyze the balance between
controllability and predictability in chaotic systems (see also Miyoshi 2025). Second,
Miyoshi and Sun (2022) proposed using ensemble forecasts to find small but effective
control perturbations. From the analysis ensemble estimated by ensemble data
assimilation, the extended ensemble forecast is performed. Then, they defined the “best”
and “worst” ensemble members and used the difference between these two members to
design control perturbations. They found that this approach effectively exploited the
system’s chaotic dynamics to estimate appropriate perturbations. Sawada (2024)
advanced the ensemble-based method by proposing Ensemble Kalman Control (EnKC).
Recognizing that data assimilation methods in geoscience such as Ensemble Kalman
Filter (EnKF) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) in control engineering both minimize
similar cost functions, Sawada (2024) proposed using EnKF to estimate control

perturbations effectively, leveraging ensemble-based sensitivity information.

Inspired by Miyoshi and Sun (2022), many studies have performed CSE and explored the
controllability of chaotic systems (Sun et al. 2023; Ouyang et al. 2023; Kawasaki and
Kotsuki 2024; Sawada 2024, 2025; Kawasaki et al. 2025; Kurosawa et al. 2025). However,
these works used toy models such as those of Lorenz (1963) and Lorenz et al. (1995). To
our knowledge, no published studies have yet to apply CSE or ensemble forecast-based
control optimization to realistic atmospheric simulation. Although EnKC was designed to
apply high-dimensional geoscientific problems, its potential has not been examined in
weather modification problems. Here, we present the first application of EnKC to a TC
simulation. Our goal is not to demonstrate that TCs are controllable, but rather to propose
a novel and useful data-driven framework to explore when, where and how to intervene

in TCs to mitigate their intensity by leveraging their inherent chaotic nature.

2. Method

2.1. Ensemble Kalman Control (EnKC)

The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF; Evensen 1994) is a widely used data assimilation
method in which observations and numerical simulations are integrated to provide

accurate state estimates. EnKF minimizes the following cost function:

1 = - —, 1
JG) = 5 (xe — 2B) PP (xe — a) +5 (V2 HD) R“GR-H@D)
where x; is the state variables at time ¢, x? is the background ensemble mean of state
estimates, P? is the background error covariance matrix estimated from ensemble, y?
is the observation at time t, H is the observation operator, and R is the observation error
covariance matrix. There are many flavors of EnKF to obtain the solution of the
minimization of Equation (1) and generate the analysis ensemble members, x2 i=
1,2,3,...,N, where N is the ensemble size). See Houtekamer and Zhang (2016) for the

comprehensive review of EnKF.

In EnKC, the minimization of Equation (1) is first performed using observations to obtain
the analysis ensemble, xe, Then, an extended ensemble forecast is performed from
xo over a prediction horizon, T,. By performing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EnKS;
Evensen and van Leeuwen 2000), the following minimization problem is solved to

estimate an appropriate control perturbation:

1 — = — 1 T
J’) = 5 (xe - xt) P**(x¢ — XP) + 3 (reer, - H°(xeer,)) Rot (reer, - H°(xear,)) (2)

S.t. Xtane1 = M(Xe4x), k = 0,1, Te —1
where xe is the analysis ensemble mean, P* is the analysis error covariance matrix,
Tr, is the control target indicating the desired system state at time ¢, H° is the operator
that projects the state variables to the control target, enabling comparison between the
forecasted state and the control target, R, is the user-defined weights, and M is the
model which describes the evolution of the states. This minimization seeks the smallest
perturbation, x; — x4, to be added to the initial state of nature to effectively reduce the
difference between the control target and the forecasted future state. Because this process
is conceptually similar to MPC, EnKC can be recognized as a type of MPC in which the
minimization of the cost function is solved by EnKS (see also Kurosawa et al. 2025). In
EnKC, control targets are treated as pseudo-observations, and optimal perturbations are
obtained by “assimilating” these control targets into the model-estimated state variables.

Further algorithmic details are provided in Sawada (2024).

The solution of the vanilla EnKC, xf — xe, includes non-zero elements for all state
variables, implying modifications to the entire system state. This is apparently unrealistic
in the case of TC modification. To enforce sparsity in control interventions, we applied

the following function to all entries of x¢ — xe:

0 if 16:1 <A
T(O;) = 0; (3)
0; otherwise
_ 18;
A=A* max | —

Gj
where 0; is the ith entry of xf — xe and o; is the analysis standard deviation of the ith
entry of a state vector. The ratio il can be interpreted as a signal-to-noise ratio of the
u
control perturbations, and we used only perturbations with sufficiently large signal-to-
noise ratios. The hyperparameter A determines sparsity. When A = 1, only the grid
point with the largest signal-to-noise ratio is perturbed. Smaller A allow interventions

across more state variables, and when A = 0, Equation (3) reduces to the vanilla EnKC.

2.2. Experiment design

We used SCALE-LETKF (Lian et al. 2017), which couples the Scalable Computing for
Advanced Library and Environment (SCALE) regional atmospheric model (Nishizawa et
al. 2015; Sato et al. 2015) with the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF)
data assimilation system (Hunt et al. 2007; Miyoshi and Yamane 2007). The SCALE-
LETKF system has been successfully applied to forecasting various severe weather
events (e.g., Honda et al. 2018a, 2018b, 2025; Taylor et al. 2021a, 2023).

We simulated an idealized TC within a 2000km x 2000km horizontal domain with a
horizontal grid spacing of 5km. The model employed 50 vertical levels with the model
top at 25km. The initial environment was horizontally homogeneous and defined by the
mean sounding profile of Jordan (1958). The initial vortex had a maximum wind speed
of 20m/s and a radius of maximum wind of 120km. The Coriolis parameter was set to
5x10° [1/s]. Periodic boundary conditions were applied. We used the same setting of
physical parameterization as previous SCALE-LETKF studies (e.g., Honda et al. 2025).
The model employed a Smagorinsky-type turbulence parameterization (Brown et al.
1994), the Mellor- Yamada-Nakanishi-Niino boundaly layer scheme (Nakanishi and Niino
2004), a parallel plane radiation model (Sekiguchi and Nakajima 2008), and a one-
moment six-category bulk cloud microphysics model (Tomita 2008). Sea surface

temperature was set to 300 K, and surface fluxes were estimated by a bulk model.

We performed a CSE experiment. We added Gaussian white noise whose mean and
standard deviation are 0 and 0.1 g/kg to the initial vertical profile of water vapor and
generated 101 initial conditions. One of these initial conditions was randomly selected as
the “nature run”, while the remaining 100 initial conditions were used for the ensemble
members of EnKC, with the ensemble size of 100. The same SCALE model was used to
integrate both the nature run and the ensemble members of EnKC. After a 72-hour spin-
up period, we performed data assimilation for 96 hours. Subsequently, the intervention

phase was initiated and continued for 72 hours during which the TC was in its stable stage.

We assumed that wind speed, specific humidity, and temperature can be observed in every
2 grid point horizontally and vertically, with the observation error of 0.1m/s, 0.01 g/kg,
and 0.1 K, respectively. Also, the central pressure was assumed to be observed with an
observation error of 5 hPa. Observations were generated by adding Gaussian white noise
with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation equal to the assumed observation error to the
nature run. We assimilated these observations every | hour. The horizontal and vertical
localization radii were set to 50km and 0.3/n p (where p is the pressure), respectively. A
multiplicative covariance inflation factor of 1.45 was applied. Although this observation
network allows accurate estimation of TC states, our controller had no access to nature

run and needed to estimate perturbations under finite predictability.

The control target was defined as achieving a minimum pressure of 960 hPa at the lowest
atmospheric layer (note that this is not sea-level pressure). In Equation (2), Ty47, was
set to 960 hPa, and the operator H° extracted the minimum pressure at the lowest layer
from each ensemble member. To minimize the cost function (Equation 2), this central
pressure value of 960 hPa was “assimilated” into x, The prediction horizon, T,, was
set to | hour, so that control perturbations were estimated and applied every 1 hour based
on a 1-hour extended forecast. Controlled nature was integrated by SCALE after EnKC-
estimated perturbations had been added. The weighting parameter R, was set to 1.0 hPa.
Since the central pressure at the beginning of the intervention period was approximately

955 hPa, our controller estimated perturbations to increase the central pressure.

In this study, we examined where water vapor should be removed by e.g., sea surface
temperature cooling (Hlywiak and Nolan 2022; Oceantherm 2025), surfactant (e.g.,
Mozafari et al. 2019; Saggari and Bachi 2018; Gallego-Elvira et al. 2013; Schouten et al.
2012), or atmospheric water harvesting (e.g., Lord et al. 2021) to mitigate TC. Since
removing water vapor at high altitudes is unlikely to be technologically feasible,
modifications were restricted to the lowest atmospheric layer. In addition, interventions
were limited to within a 500km radius from the TC eye. Therefore, all entries of xf — xe
were set to zero except for the water vapor variables in the lowest layer near the TC center.
Then, we applied the thresholding function of Equation (3) to further limit the perturbed

model grid points. Finally, we ignored the positive water vapor perturbations, as
increasing water vapor is also technologically unrealistic. We conducted experiments with
A= 0.0, 0.5, 0.8, 0.9, 0.925, and 0.95 to examine how small the scale of interventions
could be while still mitigating the TC.

3. Results

Figure | shows the control perturbations of water vapor added to nature run. The
intervention begins northwest of the TC center and gradually moves counterclockwise
with all a (see also Supplement Movies S1-S6 in
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rUx VDR2TCOdQQnScZLT8-
NUv_wlUuZbL?usp=sharing). The control perturbations tend to appear on the side of
active convection (indicated by black dots in Figure 1), suggesting that EnKC
preferentially targets regions of strong moist convection. As / increases, the spatial scale
of the interventions decreases. This effect is clearly illustrated in Figure 2, which shows
the total amount of water vapor reductions, and Figure $1, which shows the total number
of interventions. In the experiment of A = 0, nearly all grid points in the lowest
atmospheric layer around the TC center were modified, and some grid points were
repeatedly perturbed throughout the 72-hour intervention period (note that we have 72
chances to intervene in our 72-hour intervention period). In contrast, experiments with
larger A show interventions confined to smaller areas. To mitigate TC, water vapor
reductions are applied approximately 250km from the TC center, surrounding the strongly
convective eyewall region. The total amount of water vapor reduction is apparently
smaller with the larger 2, so that the increase of A can mitigate the total energy

necessary to intervene as well as the spatial scale of the interventions.

This intervention to water vapor successfully decreases TC intensity in most cases. Figure
3a shows that minimum sea-level pressure was increased by interventions in all
experiments except for 1 = 0.95. While the TC starts weakening in the first 24 hours in
the experiments with smaller A = 0, 0.5, 0.8, it takes longer to find the distinct effect of
interventions in those with larger 2. Note that EnKC reduces the magnitude of
perturbations when the central pressure approaches the prescribed control goal. Although
the perturbations estimated with the experiments with smaller A can further increase TC
pressure, EnKC does not exploit this potential once their control goals are nearly met.
Ultimately, similar levels of TC weakening were achieved for most 2 values except for
A = 0.95, demonstrating that EnKC can efficiently identify perturbations that mitigate
TC intensity. Although the relationship between central pressure and wind speed is not
strictly linear, Figure 3b shows that these increases of minimum sea-level pressure were

accompanied by substantial reductions in maximum surface wind speed.

The mitigation of TC intensity by localized water vapor removal can be attributed to the
suppression of convective activity and the associated decrease in latent heat release within
the eyewall. Figure 4 and Figure S2 reveal that all successful experiments produce
substantial reductions in condensed water around the radius of maximum wind and
weakened secondary flow by t = 48 h. This weakened convective activity cools the warm
core and reduces the primary circulation and storm intensity, consistent with explanations
based on the Sawyer-Eliassen equation (e.g., Pendergrass and Willoughby 2009). It
should be noted that experiments with small-scale interventions (e.g., 2 = 0.9) achieve
comparable reductions in condensed water to those with larger-scale interventions (e.g.,
A =0.0,0.5), implying that EnKC can pinpoint effective locations and timings for
efficiently weakening convection. The regions of intervention in the experiments with
larger A imply that moisture reduction upstream of the convectively active region may
have contributed to the convective suppression. EnKC thus leverages small-scale
perturbations of water vapor to affect strong convection in the eyewall and alter TC
structure without requiring explicit prior knowledge of TC dynamics. In the case of failure
(i.e., A = 0.95), no consistent reduction in condensed water within the eyewall was found.
Because our approach is intrinsically probabilistic, the overall success rate of
interventions should be assessed in future works to confirm their robustness towards real-

world applications, which is beyond the scope of this study.

4. Discussions and conclusions

Although we do not propose operationally feasible TC intervention methods in this paper,
the spatial scale of our obtained interventions is smaller than that of many previous works.
Earlier studies on TC modification typically considered large-scale interventions
encompassing the entire storm (e.g., Henderson et al. 2005; Jacobson et al. 2014; Zhang
et al. 2007; Cotton et al. 2007; Tran et al. 2025). For example, Hlywiak and Nolan (2022)
examined the impact of targeted artificial ocean cooling to reduce evaporation (see also
Oceantherm 2025) on the mitigation of TC and concluded that such interventions would
be infeasible, as they would require an intervened area on the order of 10° km. Our EnKC
results suggest that the scales of intervention at each time can potentially be smaller than
10° km”, if the intervention location is adaptively updated over time, even under finite
predictability, in which the controller relies only on imperfect 1-hour forecasts. However,

our interventions’ magnitude, which is approximately 0.5 g/kg reduction in near-surface
(500m) water vapor, is still substantial, corresponding to roughly a 25-50% reduction in
surface evaporation. While challenging, such magnitudes may not be impossible since
surfactant intervention is reported to be able to reduce evaporative flux by up to 50%
under idealized conditions (e.g., Mozafari et al. 2019). Nevertheless, their performance
in the real ocean and the potential environmental side effects should be investigated. Also,
the adaptive change of the intervention locations is operationally difficult. Although the
present results do not confirm the feasibility of practical TC modification, the efficiency
of the control intervention can be further improved through higher spatial resolution of
atmospheric models to capture smaller-scale processes, the combinations of multiple
intervention strategies, fine-tuning of hyperparameters such as prediction horizon (T;)
and control weights (R,), and the refinement of the algorithm to enhance robustness to
non-linear dynamics and to explicitly consider realistic control constraints such as the
distance of locations between subsequent interventions. This paper is an initial step to
find effective and feasible perturbations to mitigate TCs by leveraging their chaotic nature

under finite predictability.

Previously, numerical studies on TC and general weather modifications have adopted a
process-driven, or bottom-up, approach. Based on physical understanding of targeted
weather systems, researchers pre-determined when, where, and how to apply
interventions, and then evaluated their effects by comparing simulations with and without
prescribed controls. This research process is time-consuming for trials and errors and is
difficult to leverage the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, since small changes in the
location or magnitude of interventions can drastically alter the outcome. In contrast, we
produce a data-driven, or top-down, approach for weather modification. Given a specified
control objective, our algorithm automatically determines when, where, and how
interventions should be applied. The resulting interventions are derived entirely from
(simulated) data yet remain physically interpretable within the context of TC dynamics.
We can leverage strong sensitivity to perturbations (i.e., chaos) by adaptively using
ensemble sensitivity quantified from short-term ensemble forecast where predictability
holds to some extent. EnKC is a useful tool for doing TC modification research in a data-
driven, or top-down, way. This is the dawn of the data-driven exploration of TC’s
controllability. Combined with the process-based approaches, our approach has the
potential to accelerate the exploration of controllability of TC and the other weather

phenomena.
