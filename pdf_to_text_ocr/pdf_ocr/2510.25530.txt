Abstract: We compare modulator designs on thick-film and thin-film silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates
based on the carrier-depletion effect. This effect exhibits a lower junction capacitance as compared to its
injection counterparts, leading to a higher electro-optic bandwidth, although the effective refractive index
change is low. In this work, commercially available standard SOI substrates with device layer thicknesses
of 5 yum, 3 um, and 0.22 jum are chosen for designing carrier-depletion-based phase shifters, which are then
utilized for the design of Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZMs). These MZMs are tested for various
on-off-keying (OOK) modulation bit rates employing non-return-to-zero (NRZ) pseudo-random binary
signal (PRBS). For the comparison of given designs, we find that the thick-film MZMs, which can provide
higher fabrication tolerance and high power handling capabilities, support maximum modulation speeds in
the order of a few Gbps, whereas it can go up to 20 Gbps for thin-film MZMs.

1. Introduction

The maturity of the silicon microelectronics industry led to the use of silicon platforms for photonics
applications. This trend is further enhanced after Soref et al. [1] reported the electro-optic effects in silicon,
leading to active integrated photonic devices. Silicon photonics is predominantly realized on the
silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform, which offers high index contrast and CMOS compatibility. Early
implementations employed thick-film SOI substrates, with device layers ranging from 3 to 5 yum, suitable
for butt-coupling and early optical interconnects [2, 3]. However, with increasing demands for
compactness, higher bandwidth, and energy efficiency, the field transitioned toward thin-film SOI
platforms, notably the 220 nm device layer, which enables strong mode confinement and efficient phase
modulation through compact structures [4, 5]. The development of electro-optic modulators (EOMs) on
SOI platforms quickly became popular because modulators are an integral part of optical interconnects for
high-speed data transfer. Both carrier injection and carrier depletion mechanisms have been extensively
explored in SOI-based modulators [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Carrier injection, which relies on forward-biased p-n or
p-i-n junctions, offers a large refractive index change, but suffers from limited bandwidth due to minority
carrier lifetimes. In contrast, carrier depletion, which employs reverse-biased junctions, provides faster
modulation speeds at the expense of a smaller index change. Despite this trade-off, carrier-depletion-based
modulators have become the preferred architecture for high-speed applications, especially in Mach-Zehnder
interferometer (MZI)-based designs due to their linearity and scalability [11, 12]. All-silicon phase and
intensity modulators on both thick and thin SOI substrates have been extensively studied. For example, in
thick-film SOI, early reports showed modulators employing both carrier depletion [13] and carrier injection
[14] with moderate bandwidths of only a few MHz. However, experimental validation and in-depth studies
of thick-film SOI modulators remain relatively scarce. On the other hand, 220-nm SOI platform employing
carrier depletion achieved state-of-the-art modulators having V,L <1 V-cm, electro-optic bandwidths >30
GHz, and extinction ratios (ERs) >20 dB [15, 16]. In particular, for all silicon MZMs, reported results have
demonstrated bandwidths above 100 GHz with on-off keying (OOK) modulation [17], extinction ratio
values above 40 dB [8, 18], data rates reaching up to 224 Gbps [19], and insertion losses less than 5 dB
[20]. Although there have been fewer studies on carrier-depletion modulators using thick-film SOI

platforms, these platforms are valuable for applications that need low-cost solutions and lower-density
integration. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive comparisons between modulators built on
thick-film and thin-film SOI substrates, which leaves a knowledge gap. Our work focuses on designing
depletion-based Mach Zehnder Modulators (MZMs) on thick-film SOI to address this gap by examining the
performance trade-offs and practical benefits of using thick-film technology. This is important because
thick-film SOI enables designs that are better suited for high-power and relaxed bandwidth conditions,
while also broadening the scope of modulator research beyond the predominantly thin-film SOI field. By
eliminating any form of hybrid integration, we focus our analysis on the performance differences arising
from the thickness of the device layer and the geometry of the waveguide. We analyze and benchmark the
achievable modulation efficiency, extinction ratio, and bandwidth across the two platforms, aiming to
understand the trade-offs and optimization strategies for intensity modulators using the carrier depletion
effect. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the device design and the operating principle,
followed by the numerical simulation-based performance analysis of the devices discussed in Section 3.

2. Device Modeling
2.1 Rib waveguide design

For designing phase shifters on both thick- and thin-film silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates, the initial
step is to optimize the waveguide dimensions to support single-mode propagation. In this work, the
Lumerical MODE solutions tool was used for this purpose. At the targeted wavelength of 1550 nm, the
refractive index for silicon (Si) is taken as 3.475, and the index for silicon dioxide (SiO2) is 1.4447. The Si
rib waveguide is embedded in an outer cladding of SiO2. The final dimensions are listed in Table 1, and the
substrates are designated as I, II, and III throughout the article. It is important to note that the designed
thick film-based rib waveguides support both fundamental transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic
(TM) modes, due to their polarization-dependent nature, whereas in the case of a thin film substrate, it is
possible to achieve the single-mode condition with only the fundamental TE mode. Henceforth, we
consider only the TE mode for comparative analysis of the different substrates. The effective refractive
indices of the fundamental TE mode are 3.4706, 3.4542, and 2.5675 for substrates I, H, and II,
respectively. The fundamental TE mode profile in each case is shown in Figure 1.

2.2 Phase shifter optimization

After finding the single-mode waveguide design for TE polarization on different substrates, the next
objective was to design phase modulators on these waveguides. The schematic of the phase shifter in a
cross-sectional view, including the doped rib waveguides, is shown in Figure 2.

various doped regions using (a) thick film SOI substrates (5 zm and 3 jxm SOI), and (b) thin film SOI (0.22
jum) substrates.

The thin-film SOlI-based design (Figure 2(b)) uses a configuration selected from the established literature
[11, 19, 21, 22], while the thick-film SOI-based design (Figure 2(a)) introduces a novel arrangement that
incorporates a different doping profile from previous works [13, 23, 24]. Since intrinsic silicon does not
have an electro-optic property inherently, to induce this property through the free carrier dispersion effect,
we use trivalent/p-type (e.g., Boron) and pentavalent/n-type (e.g., Phosphorus) impurities [25]. As is the
case in commercially available wafers, we start with a slightly p-doped device layer (light blue) with a
doping concentration of 10'°/cm*, then moderate doping concentrations of p-type (sky blue) and n-type
(light green) are considered for the formation of junctions. In particular, for thick films as shown in Figure
2(a), we choose doping depths, e.g., based on the feasibility through ion implantation, that cover only a part
of the rib and slab regions, leading to the formation of p-i-n junctions. On the other hand, in the case of thin
film substrates (Figure 2(b)), doping of the entire device layer is considered, creating p-n junctions. Highly
doped p++ (deep blue) and n++ (deep green) regions in the slab with a doping concentration of 1 x
10°°/cm? act as ohmic contacts for placing the electrodes, which enhances the tunneling of carriers, enabling
the formation of the p-i-n/p-n junctions[26]. When a reverse bias is applied to the junctions, it changes the
carrier concentration of the device layer, which in turn changes the refractive index of the region. The
carrier dispersion effect is defined by the relations given in Equations | and 2 [25],

where An is the change in real part of refractive index, and Aq is the change in its imaginary part (i.e.,
extinction coefficient related to absorption). e is the electronic charge; A is the operating wavelength; €, is
the permittivity of free space; n is the refractive index of the unperturbed material; AN, and AN,, are the
free carrier concentrations of electrons and holes, respectively; m, and m, are the relative masses of
electrons and holes, respectively; 4, and 1, are the mobilities of electrons and holes, respectively; and c is
the speed of light. As can be seen from Equation (1), increasing the reverse bias reduces the free carrier
concentrations in the junction, which in turn increases the refractive index of the material. Similarly, this
effect causes the extinction coefficient in Equation (2) to reduce. To incorporate this carrier dispersion
effect into our phase shifter design, we chose to optimize several key parameters, including doping
concentration for moderately doped p and n regions, doping depth, electrode gap, and electrode width. It
has been established that for maximizing the phase shifter performance, the p-doped regions should have a
lower concentration and a larger area than the n-doped regions [27]. But since our goal is to compare the
phase shifter performance based on SOI substrates of different thicknesses, we considered a symmetric
doping profile (equal doping concentration and area) between p and n regions. The electrical simulations of
the phase shifters were done using the CHARGE solver of Ansys Lumerical. The doping depths for
moderate and highly doped regions along the rib and slab are considered to be the same, so all this doping
can be done in a single fabrication step.

As mentioned previously, we vary the doping concentration, the doping depth (d), the electrode gap (g) and
the electrode width (w,) to obtain the maximum variation in the effective refractive index of the
fundamental TE mode, An», while maintaining a reasonable extinction coefficient. The doping
concentrations of the moderately doped regions are varied from 1 x 10'/em? to 1 x 10!*/cm? in all three
substrates. The resultant variations of An, with respect to the applied reverse bias voltage are shown in
Figure 3, where Figure 3(a,b,c) correspond to substrate I, II and III, respectively. These variations of An.
can be attributed to the change in charge carriers inside the guided mode volume. The nonlinear nature of
the refractive index variations in all cases, although not clearly visible in Figure 3(a) because of scaling, is
due to the carrier depletion effect producing a non-uniform distribution of carriers in the p-i-n /p-n
junctions, leading to non-linear dependence of the depletion width on voltage [23]. The depletion width of

the junction is given by,

where, €) is the vacuum permittivity and €, is the relative permittivity of silicon, V, is the built in potential,
V is the applied voltage, N, and Np are the concentrations of acceptors and donors, respectively; and e is

For the thick-film substrates, in Figure 3(a,b), we focus on finding a doping concentration leading to the
maximum An,, which occurs for a doping concentration 5 x 10'%/cm’ for substrate I and 5 x 10'’/cm? for
substrate II. In the case of substrate III, although higher doping concentrations give higher An. values as
shown in Figure 3(c), it also causes higher optical losses, as expected from Equation (4). In the thin film,
since the entire device layer is doped as opposed to a partial covering in thick films, the overlap between
the guided mode field and the free carriers is much higher, leading to larger refractive index variations as
well as larger losses. Therefore, in the thin film, we have chosen a carrier concentration of 1 x 10!7/em? as a
trade-off for obtaining the required refractive index variation while maintaining reasonable carrier-induced
optical losses (< 2 dB/cm) as shown in Figure 9(a)).

Similarly, the variation in the imaginary part (@) of the effective index of the fundamental mode with the
reverse bias voltage is shown for substrates I, II, and III in Figures 4(a,b,c), when subjected to different
doping concentrations. The parameter @ relates to the optical losses of the device as

loss =— 200, i ] (4)

where, z is the propagation length. It can be seen that the values of a show a decreasing trend with
increasing reverse bias. The reason is that, while subjected to depletion, free carrier absorption decreases
due to the fewer carriers left, which causes the a@ value to reduce. The same effect is also observed with
respect to the variation in doping concentration as a result of the availability of lesser free carriers at lower
doping concentrations.

Regarding doping depth optimization, the entire device layer of the thin film substrate (III) is doped, as is
common practice. In contrast, for thick film substrates, the doping depth is varied from 100 nm to 500 nm.
A larger doping depth gives better interaction between the optical mode field and the charge carriers,
leading to a higher An. as can be seen in Figure 5(a) and Figure 5(b) for substrates I and II, respectively.
Subsequently, the variation of a is presented in Figure 6(a) and Figure 6(b) for different doping depths in
substrate I and II, respectively, under reverse bias conditions. As expected, a larger doping depth causes a
to have a larger value, thus enhancing optical absorption.

The electrode gaps are varied from 6 im to 10 ym for substrate I, 4 j1m to 8 pm in case of substrate II, and
4 um to 6 pm in case of substrate III. We have chosen these different ranges for different substrates keeping
in mind the difference in waveguide widths in each substrate as required for their single-mode behavior
(Figure 1). Additionally, the minimum gap is set by taking into account the possibility of non-vertical
sidewalls of the waveguides. Figure 7(a) and Figure 7(b) show the An,» for different electrode gaps in case
of substrates I and II, respectively. It can be seen that as the electrode gap reduces, An. increases.
Henceforth, the electrodes should be kept closer to the waveguide edges, but not too close to touch the
evanescent field to avoid further optical losses. Consequently, the electrode gaps have been chosen as 8 pm
for substrate I and 5 ym for substrate II, considering the corresponding extinction coefficients (a) from
Figure 8(a) and Figure 8(b). As observed, a smaller electrode gap leads to free carriers being confined
closer to the optical mode field, which increases the free carrier-optical mode overlap, thereby increasing
absorption. In addition, closer electrodes intensify local electric field, which enhances the separation and
distribution of charge carriers by exerting stronger electrostatic forces. Substrate III experiences negligible
change in An. with variation of electrode gap, and remains same as that in Figure 3(c). Similarly, electrode
width is varied from | pm to 2 um. Within this range, there was only a slight change in An, for substrates I
and II, and almost no change for substrate III. Hence, the electrode gap and the electrode width for
substrate III are chosen such that the modal overlap with the charge carriers were minimized [12]. Based on
this analysis, suitable electrode widths were chosen for all the three substrates, along with an electrode gap
of 6 um for substrate II]. On the basis of the analysis of various parameters mentioned above, we compare
the performance of phase-shifter designs in the three substrates. In particular, we get An.» of the
fundamental TE modes as 4.3 x 10°, 7.4 x 10°, and 1.1 x 10 on substrates I, II, and III, respectively,
through the optimization of various parameters as detailed in the previous section, while the reverse bias
voltage varies from 0 V to 5 V. The corresponding V,L for the three devices are given in Table 2. It can be
seen from the values that thick film-based designs require either a larger phase shifter length or higher
reverse bias voltages to achieve the m phase shift for the full modulation depth, whereas for the thin film,
both the required voltage and the length are within the desired range. Therefore, for thick films, there must
be a trade-off between a CMOS-compatible voltage, V,, and a feasible length for the standard fabrication
process. For example, for the thin film, if we consider a V, of 5 V, then the phase shifter length would be
6.45 mm. The optical losses for the three phase shifter designs, as well as the relative phase shift for a
phase shifter length of 6.45 mm, are shown in Figure 9. In Figure 9(c), the phase changes are not linearly
dependent on the voltage due to the non-linear dependence of the depletion width on the voltage [23], as
given in Equation (3).

2.3 Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) operation and performances

To validate the above phase-shifter designs, we configured intensity modulators on all three SOI substrates
using the phase shifter in one of the arms of a Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI). Since we are
conducting a comparative study, we chose a phase-shifter length of around 6.45 mm in all three substrates,
although it provides a V, of 5 V only for the thin-film substrate as mentioned in the previous section. The
MZM schematic is shown in Figure 10.

Fig. 10. Schematic of the MZM having a phase shifter in one arm.

The electrodes are placed on the slab region, spanning the entire length of the phase-shifter. Depending on
the radio-frequency (RF) signal applied, the electrodes can be lumped or traveling wave type. Suppose the
electrode length is sufficiently smaller (one-tenth) compared to the RF wavelength (i.e, Age < Ao/Npp ). In
that case, it is a lumped electrode configuration, and greater in the case of a traveling-wave configuration
[28]. Here, A, is the RF wavelength in vacuum, and ney is the RF index. Two Y-splitters/combiners are used
to split/combine the input continuous wave (CW) signals into the two arms, which then interfere to produce
the modulated output. We consider an input signal power of 10 mW to diagnose the signal modulation with
less jitter and amplitude distortion. The output intensity J of an MZM is given as

i
[= {1 + cosd] (5)

where J, is the input intensity and Ad is the phase change. The Y-splitter/combiner element is simulated
using the Ansys Lumerical INTERCONNECT module, providing an insertion loss of 2.6 dB [29].
Aluminum is used for the vias as well as contact pads to which both direct current (DC) bias and radio
frequency (RF) signals can be applied. An upper cladding of silicon dioxide (SiO,) was considered, which
encapsulates the waveguide layer just enough to expose the contact pads. For simulation, we have chosen a
via depth (h,;.) equal to the rib height, and contact pad thickness of 2 um with a width (w,) of 50 um. The
corresponding RF losses and the RF group indices are shown in Figure 11 for the three substrates. It can be
seen from Figure 11(a) that RF losses start increasing rapidly above 1 GHz for all the substrates, which can
be further improved by careful design of the RF transmission lines. It can also be observed from Figure
11(b) that the mismatch between the optical and RF indices for the modulators is reduced close to their
electro-optic cut-off frequency. At frequencies higher than 1 GHz, we get a close match between the RF
and guided mode indices, which is critical for high-frequency modulator design [30], in particular, because
in this frequency range, the RF losses typically start increasing. At low frequencies, though, the index
mismatch between the RF and the guided mode is higher, its impact is less critical since, in addition to the
very low RF losses, the modulation mechanism differs in this range.

2.3.1 Static characteristics

To validate the system-level performance of the designed phase shifters in the MZM, we simulated static
characteristics using Lumerical INTERCONNECT. This step is essential because it provides insight into
the phase shifter’s behavior under various bias conditions, helping to verify its phase tuning range, losses,
and wavelength shift. Figure 12 shows the response spectra of the MZMs with different driving voltages.
For all the substrates, we choose a length of ~ 6.45 mm, which corresponds to a full modulation only for
substrate III for a bias of 5 V (Table 2). An extra length of 100 jm is introduced into the lower arm of the
MZM (Figure 10), to simulate the transmission spectra. However, it is worth noting that this value of length
mismatch is used only to determine optical transmission characteristics with respect to different biases and
is not applied in the actual MZM. At 0 V (Ad = 0), the transfer function in Equation (5) indicates the
maximum intensity, which gives the static extinction ratio of the devices. It can be seen from the figures
that an increase in reverse bias causes a left shift in the wavelength, as well as changes the intensity level of
the transmitted signal according to the transfer function of the respective modulators. The wavelength shift
in response to the bias voltage is lowest in the case of substrate I (Figure 12(a)) and highest for the substrate
IlI-based modulator (Figure 12(c)), which is a direct indication of their modulation depth. As can be seen in
the figures, the achieved static extinction ratio values are less than 20 dB, which is typical for silicon
modulators [31]. In a practical and unbalanced MZL, losses in the arms (due to absorption and imperfect
splitting) will broaden the spectral features, leading to lower fringe contrast and wider resonance-like
notches. The resonance notches for thick film substrates are narrower, indicating a higher Q-factor, which is
attributed to their lower losses as discussed in section 2. In contrast, the thin-film substrate-based device
exhibits a broader tuning range but with wider resonance peaks, which corresponds to a lower Q-factor due
to higher losses. The static characteristics show the output intensities of the non-ideal modulator, taking
absorption coefficients into consideration. The ideal transfer function given in Equation 5 no longer
satisfies the behavior of the output intensity.

2.3.2 Bandwidth estimation

Considering a load resistance of 50 ©, the RC limited bandwidths of the devices are found to be 3.6 GHz,
8.9 GHz, and 12.9 GHz for substrates I, II and III, respectively. These estimates are calculated using the
slab resistance and junction capacitance obtained for the three devices. The slab resistance values for
substrates I, H, and III are 22731.3 Q:um, 17154.1 Q-um, and 56495.7 Q-um, respectively. The
corresponding junction capacitance values are 1.93086 fF/um, 1.03638 fF/um, and 0.219631 fF/um. The 3
dB electro-optic bandwidth of the designed MZMs obtained from the S,, parameters in the
INTERCONNECT simulations, as shown in Figure 13, are 3.5 GHz, 6.5 GHz, and 9.5 GHz respectively for
substrates I, I, and III. The deviation of the bandwidth values achieved from system-level simulations in
the INTERCONNECT module from the theoretically estimated values, particularly for the substrates II and
III, stems from the underlying electrode configuration. Specifically, the INTERCONNECT simulation uses
lumped electrode configurations for substrates I within their bandwidth limit, whereas for substrates II and
III, a traveling-wave electrode configuration is considered near the cut-off frequency. The traveling wave
electrode configuration is more energy intensive, leading to a lower bandwidth in practice [32].

2.3.3 RF transmission characteristics

Based on the bandwidth estimation, we characterize the RF transmission of the MZMs for on-off-keying
(OOK) modulation through the eye diagram analysis for non-return-to-zero (NRZ) pseudo-random binary
sequences (PRBSs). The eye diagrams are shown in Figures 14, 15, and 16 for substrates I, II, and III,
respectively, at frequencies above and below the cut-off frequencies in all three substrates. Note that we
have carefully balanced the length difference between the two arms of the MZM to ensure that the
modulator setpoint is close to the quadrature point. One can also use the DC bias voltage to fine-tune the
quadrature setpoint. However, for the purpose of comparison, we set a fixed DC bias at 0 V for all three
cases, and chose a suitable Var below 5 V for near-perfect eye crossing.

For all three substrates, we observe clear eye-openings at signal frequencies well below their cut-off values,
leading to extremely low bit error rates (BER). On the contrary, for signal frequencies higher than the
corresponding cut-off frequencies, the eye-opening significantly degrades, indicating higher time jitter,
intersymbol interference, and BER. Moreover, the extinction ratio increases for the thinner substrates due to
their enhanced modulation efficiency.

3. Conclusion

This work provides a comprehensive overview of carrier-depletion-based MZMs designed on commercially
available SOI substrates with different device-layer thicknesses. In summary, the presented design approach
reveals that 5 zm SOI substrates are optimal for applications prioritizing low propagation losses (< 1.8
dB/cm) and moderate operating speeds on the order of several hundred megahertz. 3 sm SOI substrates in
the chosen design can accommodate even lower losses (< 1.5 dB/cm) while enabling operation into the
multi-gigahertz range. For scenarios where higher speeds are essential, 220 nm SOI substrates facilitate
operation at several tens of gigahertz, with associated losses maintained < 2 dB/cm. However, further
optimization of thin-film-based designs could enable significantly greater speed enhancements, though this
is generally accompanied by increased optical losses. To conclude, thin film substrates are better for
applications involving high bandwidth requirements. However, thick film SOJ-based MZMs may still find
use in low-speed, low-integration density applications, especially where low losses and high power
handling are required. They are also economical, in addition to providing higher fabrication tolerance, and
ease of batch processing by means of optical lithography, whereas the thin-film-based devices require
higher precision technology like electron beam lithography (EBL) or deep ultra-violet (DUV) lithography.
Therefore, this study may provide users with flexibility on substrate choice, allowing the device structure to
be optimized for specific system needs and targeted performance outcomes.
