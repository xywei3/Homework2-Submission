their associated currents, and vertex operators and their descendants, with respect

1 Introduction

The sine-Gordon model is a paradigmatic example of a 1+1 dimensional relativistic
quantum field theory (QFT), and it has played an important role in the development
of quantum integrable models. It exhibits rich and highly non-trivial dynamics, while
its integrability enables the use of powerful non-perturbative techniques [I] [2] [3] to
solve the model.

Beyond its theoretical appeal, the sine-Gordon model also has experimental rel-
evance, as it can be realized in systems of cold atoms [4|-[10]. Further realizations
via quantum circuits and coupled spin chains are also proposed.

In recent years, there has been growing interest in the non-equilibrium dynamics
of isolated quantum systems, driven by both theoretical progress and experimental
advances in cold atom physics. In integrable systems, where an infinite set of con-
served quantities constrain the dynamics, conventional thermalization is replaced
by relaxation towards a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE) [13} (14) [15]. A crucial
aspect of the generalized Gibbs ensemble is that it provides the fundamental statis-
tical description of integrable systems’ long time steady states by accounting for the
complete set (or a large subset) of conserved quantities [14] [17]. GGE is not
only essential for understanding equilibration in isolated quantum systems but also
serves as the foundational building block for advanced theoretical frameworks such
as generalized hydrodynamics [18] [19]. By precisely capturing the local conserved
charges and their associated potentiald!), the GGE establishes the baseline ensem-
ble from which hydrodynamic equations describing non-equilibrium transport and
large-scale dynamics in integrable models are derived. Thus, the significance of the
GGE extends beyond static properties, underpinning much of the modern progress
in describing integrable quantum dynamics.

Recent research has seen a resurgence of interest in the equilibrium and non-
equilibrium thermodynamics of the sine-Gordon model, which has become an ac-
ively explored domain in integrable quantum field theories [20|-[31]. Despite the
model’s integrability, the formulation of the generalized Gibbs ensemble remains
non-trivial. While the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) [82] [33] provides a
framework for constructing the GGE in the sine-Gordon model, the structure and
form of the resulting equations depend strongly on the value of the coupling con-
stant, making the implementation cumbersome and highly case-specific [34] [27].
To overcome these limitations, Non-Linear Integral Equation (NLIE) methods
have been developed in various contexts [35] [36] [37] {38} [39) [40]. These often allow
for a more compact and efficient numerical treatment, as well as analytic control
over the solutions. In this paper, we develop two such NLIE formulations, denoted

1Later, in the text we also call them generalized inverse temperatures in order to avoid confusion
with the thermodynamic potentials.

as NLIE I and NLIE I, to describe the generalized Gibbs ensemble in the sine-
Gordon model. Our construction starts from the TBA description of the GGE
at special integer values of the coupling constant p, where the equations can be
organized according to a D,4, Dynkin-diagram structure [41] [42] [43]. We make use
of the well-established techniques based on the Y-system and T-Q relations to
reformulate the TBA equations into NLIEs [46] [47] [48]. Although our derivation
is performed at special points, the resulting equations admit analytic continuation
to arbitrary values of the coupling constant in the repulsive regime. In fact, the
dependence on the coupling is encoded entirely in the kernel functions of the integral
equations, allowing for a straightforward generalization. The two NLIE formulations
have different domains of applicability. While NLIE I allows for limited extension
into the attractive regime, it suffers from restrictions due to the shrinking analyticity
strips of the unknown functions, which limits the number of conserved charges that
can be included. In contrast, the NLIE II formulation is free from this limitation
and permits an arbitrary number of charges to be coupled into the ensemble, bu
only in the whole repulsive regime.

Within their respective domains, our NLIE formulations provide an efficient an
versatile framework for computing the generalized Gibbs potential, as well as ex-
pectation values of conserved charge densities, their associated currents, and loca
operators with respect to the GGE, at any value of the coupling constant of the
theory. These results provide powerful tools for the analytical and numerical inves-
tigation of thermodynamic properties in the sine-Gordon model, both in and out of
equilibrium.

The plan of the paper is as follows. In section [2] we fix our conventions and
summarize the TBA description of the GGE in the repulsive regime at the specia
points of the coupling constant, where the equations can be encoded into a D-type
Dynkin diagram. In section B] we derive the two equivalent NLIE formulations for
the TBA description of the GGE. Section 4] contains a discussion on the reason for
the restricted validity of NLIE I in the attractive regime. In section] we summarize,
how to compute expectation values of conserved charge densities, their associated
currents and vertex operators in the context of our NLIE formalism. Section [6]closes
the paper, with a short summary and some discussion of our results.

The paper also contains an appendix. Appendix [A] provides numerical data
supporting the validity of the NLIE I formulation in the attractive regime of the
model, in a suitable neighborhood of the free-fermion point.

2 The model and the TBA equations

In this section, we summarize the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) description of
the generalized Gibbs ensemble [32] [33] in the sine-Gordon model at certain special
points in the repulsive regime, where the equations become simply encoded into a
D—type Dynkin-diagram.
The Euclidean action of the model is as follows:

1 4 2K? 5
Sso[9] =f dear { 0,060.7) - ne a (Bea ole.)} 0< 6, < 8r.
(2.1)
In the sequel, we use the following parameterization of the coupling constant:
B? Be 2
M'sG se D
= , = 0<p<m. 2.2
> 8n—-B, dn pti’ pee (2.2)

The p = 1 value corresponds to the free fermion point of the theory, and the 0 <
p< 1and 1 < p regimes correspond to the attractive and repulsive regimes of the
theory, respectively.

We focus on computing the thermodynamic potential or free-energy density,
derived from the partition function of the generalized Gibbs ensemble:

1
G(B) = — jim F log Z(8), (2.3)

where

jez
is the corresponding partition function, such that Ho; 1 are the dimensionless mu-
tually commuting local integrals of motion with Lorentz spin 27 — 1. The param-
eter vector 8 = {(2;1}, j € Z, contains the dimensionless multipliers of these
conserved quantities, which we call either potentials or generalized inverse temper-
atures. In the sine-Gordon model, the action of these dimensionless local conserved
charges on the 1-particle soliton and anti-soliton states with rapidity @ : |0, +4), is as
follows:

Haya |0, +) = eP25-D8 19. at), jeZ. 2.5)

The usual Gibbs ensemble is a special case of (2.4) with 6; = 6_; = att such that
M, kp,T denote the soliton mass, the Boltzmann constant, and the temperature,
respectively, and all the other potentials are zero (8; =0, j # +1).
We consider the TBA equations coming from the saddle point condition for the
partition function at the special points 2 < p € N. In this case the TBA equations
can be encoded into a D,,, Dynkin-diagram [42 43] [45], in the following way:

is the source term. Here, for later convenience we used the Y —system based notation
for the unknowns of the TBA equations. In this formulation, the equations (2.6) are
well defined, if the series (2:8) converges for any x € R, and the function S(a|3) is
bounded from below. Nevertheless, for practical computations, it is more realistic
to consider the case, when only a finite number of higher-spin conserved charges are
contained in the Gibbs ensemble. Thus, in our considerations, we focus on the case,
when the number of higher-spin conserved charges is truncated. This corresponds
only to a simple S + Sy change in the source term of the TBA equations (2.6),
where:

In this case, the requirement for Sy(x|3) is that lim Sy(2|B) # —oo.

Having the solution of the saddle point TBA equations (2.6), two important
thermodynamic potentials, the free-energy density G(@) (2:3), and the free-energy
flux 6(8) [18} [60], can be computed by the formulas, as follows:

where M denotes the soliton mass. They are generators of the expectation values
of the dimensionless conserved charge densities and their associated currents, since
their derivatives with respect to the inverse temperatures give the expectation values
according to the formulas (5.1). Due to the differentiating process, the explicit

—oo
formulas for the expectation values contain the solutions of linear integral equations
obtained by differentiating the generalized TBA equations (2.6) with respect to the
generalized inverse temperatures.

Our purpose is to reformulate the TBA equations (2:6)-(2.9), which are valid
only for some special values of the coupling constant, as compact few component
non-linear integral equations that are valid for any value of the coupling constant in
the repulsive regime. As we will see in the next section, one of the NLIE formulations
(NLIE I) is found to be valid in a certain region of the attractive regime as well.

3 The derivation of the NLIEs

In this section, starting from the TBA equations presented in the previous section,
we derive two different equivalent compact NLIE formulations of the problem. Since,
these equations depend analytically on the coupling constant, analytical continua-
tion from the discrete values corresponding to the TBA formulation (2.6) to the
whole repulsive regime is straightforward.

The derivation of both sets of equations are based on the method worked out
earlier for the O(3) non-linear o—model [46], and for the sausage-model [47] 48}.
The transformation of TBA to NLIE, relies on the integrable structure of the TBA
equations, realized by the so-called Y— and T—system functional relations, and
their solution through the famous T — Q relations.

As a first step, we collect all these necessary ingredients.

3.1 Functional relations stemming from the TBA

The transformation of TBA to Y—system, starts with the observation that the
source functions (2.8) and (2.9) are solutions to a kind of zero-mode functional
equations:

S(x+%5|B) + S(@-t5|8)=0,  Sw(w@ +i 5/8) + Sy(a —7 518) =0. (3.1)

Then, it is straightforward to show [42] that the solution of TBA equations (2.6)
satisfy the Y—system functional equations:
yi UT = Yo,
uit ve = Ye Yeu, k=2,..,Np—3, an
YN,-2 Yn,—2 = YNp—3 Ynp-1 YNps :

+ ee
YNp—1YNp—1 = YNp YNp = YNp—2s

where we introduced the notation for any function f*(a) = f(x +im/2). The first
N, — 3 elements of these functions satisfy standard su(2) type Y—system relations.

5
To this part one can associate a T—system of the fornth

Tg Ty =14+ Tra Ths, k=0,s:,Np— 1, with T_,=0. (3.3)
The relations to the Y—functions is as follows:
Ye = Tha Thi, Ty Ty = Ye, k=1,., Np —2. (3.4)
Tx, 1 Ty,-1 = Yn,-1 Yn, ;

From the TBA equations (2.6) and (8.4) it follows that both the y— and T— func-
tions are real analytic. From (8.2) and (8.4), it follows that:

YN,—-1 = YN, = Ty, -2- (3.5)
From (8.3)- (8.5), it can be shown [47 that:
Tu, = 2+ Tn, -2: (3.6)

For the T’—system, one can associate the corresponding T — Q system [49];

Tren QU —TQUA= QA TE Qh — TAQ =Qh, (3.7)

where we introduced the notation f(a) = f(@+ik7/2).
Either Q or Q can be eliminated from the T — Q relations [49], yielding second
order difference equations:

[-k+]] pk
Q*++Q~ =AQ with A=+—*? (3.8)
Thi
- 7 _ : pik+3 x pikty
O++Q-=AQ with A=+*— (3.9)
pik)
k+1

where both A and A are k—independent. Thus, by choosing k = N, for A and
k = N, — 2 for A, and using the identity (8.6), one obtains:

2+ TN 4 TEN 4 Tite 4 rien
A= —— El » A= ns (3:10)
Ty, Ty,
This implies together with (@.8) and (8.9) the following relations [47]:
A= APN Q= Qe Nel, (3.11)

Though, the derivation of these relations is valid for positive integer values of N,,
(8:11) can be analytically continued for any real values of N, in a straightforward
manner.

Here, the special, though natural ¢ = 1 gauge is used in the terminology of reference [49].

3.2 Analyticity strips

In order to transform the functional relations into integral equations, it is important
o know about the functions, their behaviour at infinity, and those analyticity strips
where they are free of zeroes and poles or any other type of singularities. This
subsection is devoted to clarify these points for the functions introduced in the
previous subsection.
When we discuss, the analyticity strips, we consider the y—, T—, and Q—functions
belonging to the TBA equations with source function (2.9). Namely, we consider
he case, when only a finite number of higher conserved charges are coupled to
he thermodynamic potential. We assume that the solution of the TBA equations
(2.6), is a smooth deformation of the 8; — oo limit. In this limit, the y—, T—,
and Q—functions, tend to constant values, which we present below. The constant
solution to the y—functions take the form:

yp =(k-1) (K+ 1), he Lv, Np — 25 YN, = YN,-1 = Np — 2. 3.12)
The corresponding constant T—functions are:

Te =k, k=0,...,N,—1. 3.13)

From this, also the functions A and A, can be computed in the infinite B limit:
A® = AW = 2, 3.14)

which together with (8.8) and (8.9) gives

Q? =6* =1, 3.15)

rovided one chooses the bounded solution of the difference equations [47].

From now on, we assume that we know the solution of the TBA equations (2.6),
when the 8; constants are large, but finite. Then, all the important functions,
namely, y-, T—, and Q—functions are smooth deformations of the infinite 6 so-
utions @.12), (8-13) and (B15). Nevertheless, the infinite 6 solutions are not close
o the solution of the TBA equations (2.6) with large B, on the whole complex
plane. They are close to each other within finite strips in the imaginary directions.
In the sequel, we will analyze the equations, and determine the strips, where the
infinite G solution is close to the exact one with large, but finite @. At the same
ime, these strips will be the analyticity strips mentioned at the beginning of this
subsection. Namely, these are the strips, where the functions are analytic and free
of any singularities and zeroes.

Following the lines of [47 [48], it is useful to introduce the (a, a2) short notation
for the strip:

T T
7a < Ima < 3 02: (3.16)

For later convenience, introduce the abbreviation ANZSC, which means that a func-
tion is analytic, non-zero, free of singularities, and tend to a constant value at infinity
within a given strip of the complex plane.

Now, we turn to the TBA equations (2.6), and start to analyze the analyticity
strips of the y—functions. First, the analyticity of y; should be considered. Due to
the source term (2.9):

y: is ANZSC in (-ey,ew) with ey = ——, (3.17)
2N -1
which means that as the number of higher charges coupled to the thermodynamic
potential increases, the analyticity strip for y; is shrinking. Using the standard
techniques described in [46] and [47] 48], it can be shown that the TBA equa-
tions and the Y—system relations imply the following analyticity strips for the
y—functions:

ye is ANZSCin (1—k—ey,k—l+ey) k=1,...,N,—2. (3.18)

Following [46] [47] [48], the relations (8.3)-(8:6) give a one-unit wider strip for the
T—functions:

T, is ANZSCin (-k—ey,k+ey) k=0,...,N,—1. (3.19)

Using this, from the defining relation (8.10), one obtains the analyticity strip as
follows for A and A:

A is ANZSCin (3—ey,2N,—3+ en),

7 2!
A isANZSCin (—2N,+3-en,—-3+ ey). (3.20)

Then, the difference equations (8-8) and (5.9), give the analyticity strips for Q and
Q:
Q isANZSCin (1—ey,2N,—1+ey),

21
@ is ANZSCin (-2N, +1—ey,—-1 +n), eet)

which is consistent with the relation (811) and the conjugation relation between Q
and Q.
3.3 Deriving NLIE I.

The functional relations given in subsection 8.1] and the analyticity strips given in
the previous subsection 8.2] allow one to derive simple non-linear integral equations
for computing the generalized Gibbs potential. To do so, the following functions
composed out of the y—, T—, and Q—functions, turns out to be useful [44] [46] 47].

jlk+2] p— [k]
—s as Be=1+=2 Ti,
QI-k-2| QI-k-2| —

They satisfy the simple functional relations as follows:
by bn = Ye, Bi By =Yeu, k=0,.,N,-3, (3.23)

b — + B= _
by, 2 by,—2 —~ Yn,-2, By,-1 By-1 _ Ynp-1 Yn,-

In the rest of the paper, we derive two NLIEs. The first one is a Kliimper-
Pearce-Batchelor-Destri-de Vega type equation with a range of validity:
l-so <p. The second one is a kind of hybrid NLIE [44] [50], where the massive
TBA function is kept as one of the unknown functions [51] 52], and it is valid in the
whole repulsive regime of the theory.

This subsection is devoted to the derivation of the first equation, which we call
simply NLIE I.

The basic unknown functions of NLIE I, are the functions:

_ QPITy —,,, _@T1
o= "Gra Boh tho = Gap (3.24)
e yI-2l p+ _ - 9 ,
by = 2 10 By =1+5 = 25
Qe Ql
where Tp is expressed in terms of the zero mode function:
To(a) =e SSC), TT =1, (3.25)

with Sy(x|B) given in (2.9). It is ANZSC in the strip (—ey, en).

Now, it is important to discuss the ANZSC strips of the unknown functions
(8:24). The requirement of the existence of a finite width ANZSC strip, gives re-
strictions on the allowed range of the coupling constant p defined in (2.2).

First, we discuss the case of the repulsive regime, when there is no restriction.
Consider bp in (8:24). Using (8-19)-(8-21), one can list the analyticity strips of its
building blocks:

Q@l is ANZSC in (-1—ey,2N,—3+ey),
QU is ANZSCin (-2N,+3-—en,1 +n), (3.26)

In the repulsive regime, when 1 < p and 2 < N, the intersection of these analyticity
regions is (1 — ey, 1+ ey), which means that:

bg is ANZSC in (—en,en), 1<p. (3.27)
In the attractive regime, when 0 < p < 1, there is nontrivial intersecting region

of the strips (8.26), if 1 -— ey < 2N,-—3+ ey. This gives the restriction on the
allowed range of p, as follows:

1
1- 1, N= ; 3.28
en<p<l, aw=sy 7G (3.28)
In this case
bg is ANZSCin (-ey,ey+2(p—1)), l-en<p<1. (3.29)

Using (8.24) a completely analogous train of thoughts leads to the following analyt-
icity strips for the other unknowns:

bp is ANZSC in (—ey, en), l<p<o,
by is ANZSC in (—ey —2(p—1), ew), l-ey<p<l, (3.30)
Bo, By is ANZSC in (ey, ew), l-ex<p<o.

The ANZSC strips are important, because within these domains the logarithmic
derivatives of the relevant functiond4] can be Fourier-transformed, and the func-
tional relations among them can be translated into algebraic equations between
their Fourier-transforms [35] 44].

To carry out this procedure, first we fix our conventions for the Fourier-transformation.
The Fourier-transformation rules between a function f(x), and its transform f (w),
in our conventions are as follows:

fle) = f ave'* fla), fa) =f Fe? Fw), (3.31)

4The relevant functions are the y— T—, Q—, and b—functions introduced above as part of the
integrable hierarchy derived from the TBA equations.

10
Then, we introduce the notation dl f for the Fourier-transform of the logarithmic-
derivative of a function f :

dl f(w) = / dx e&** < log f (2). (3.32)

The Fourier-transform of the TBA kernel (2.7) becomes:

su) = -—
: ~ 2 cosh (42) ‘ (Ba)
For later convenience, we denote:

q=er. (3.34)

If dif is ANZSC in the strip (—K, K) with 0 < K € R, then the following relation
holds between the Fourier-transforms along different lines of the complex plane:

dif = gq dif, O<k<K. (3.35)

For practical purposes, it is convenient to introduce the auxiliary function, as
follows:

7 Ql
a9 = Ors” (3.36)
in terms of which
_ Te
bo=aT, b=. (3.37)
ao
From (8.26) the analyticity strips for ao are as follows:
ag is ANZSC in —l-—ey,1+ ey), l<p<o.
0 ( EN, en) Pp (3.38)

ag is ANZSC in (—(2p—1)—en,en+2p—1), l-ey<p<l.

Now, we express ag in terms of By and Bo within the appropriate analyticity strips.
Since, the explicit form of 7 is known, from such an equation the NLIE for by and
bp can be easily derived with the help of the definitions (@.37).

Now, we derive the algebraic equations in Fourier-space. Let,

p= dQ”, (3.39)

1d.
then from (8-11) and the analyticity strips (6-21):
AQ = diQ? Nel = PNe4 qo, (3.40)
Using the definition (8.36) and the analyticity strips (6.38) for ao, one obtains:
diay = (1 P*°"4) q. (3.41)
From (8.24), (8.39) and (8.40) the following two equations can be derived:
dlBy = th —P 3 @+qdt,

1 1. (3.42)
dlBy = 3 q@ -—@t idl.

q q
These equations allow one to eliminate T, and q2 and write them into (41). As a
result, one obtains:
qhe2 — gb-Np
(qXet — qe) (gq +71)

Or equivalently in the Fourier-variable w :

dlay = (qdlBt —qdlBs), q=e2. (3.43)

dlay(w) =G,(w) (= dlBt(w) —e > dB; (w))

; sinh ((p — 1) =) (3.44)
vith = .
with G,(w) 2 cosh (42) sinh (p ze)

Finally, one introduces the following new unknown functions:

do(x) = bS(@—iy$), — Go(x) = by (w@ +i 7 §),

p(n) = Bee — 87), ola) = By (w +472), G4)

where y is a contour deformation parameter, whose value is restricted by the ana-
lyticity domains of the variables (8.27)-(8.30) to

1

— A
2N—1 (3.46)

0<y¥<en=
We note that this range is valid in the repulsive regime, where the derivation of the
equations is performed.
The definitions (8.45) imply the trivial relations:

A(x) = 1+ ao(z), A(x) = 1+ ao(z). (3.47)

12
Thus, the final form of the equations NLIE I, in rapidity space takes the form:

log ag(a) = —Sy (x — if Y) + (Gp * log Ag) (a) — (GRC) * log Ay) (x),

a = 4 jh) 4 A,)(r) — (Gl2d-y) (aa)
log do(x) = —Sy(a + if 7) + (Gp * log Ao) (a) — (GE * log lo) (2).

These equations are derived at the special points of the coupling constant, when
2 <p €N. The final form of the NLIE I is analytical in p, providing a
straightforward analytical continuation within the domain: 1 — =o <p <oo. The
lower bound comes from the fact that in the p < 1— mo regime, the width of the
necessary analyticity strips would shrink to zero. This means that our NLIE I given
in (8.48), offers only a shallow penetration into the attractive regime of the theory,
such that the depth of the penetration is restricted by the highest spin entering the
series of the coupled higher-spin conserved charges.

In the attractive regime, the range of the contour deformation parameter y should
also be modified with respect to that of the repulsive regime (8.46), because in this
regime the closest to the real axis poles of G(x) are located at +i p7, which should
be avoided by the contour. This imposes the restriction: (1 — y)7 < pz, which
implies the following range for y in the attractive regime:

1
l-p<7<e€n = go:

Thus, the whole range of allowed values of y for NLIE I (8.48), takes the form:
max(0,1—p)<7< en, l-ey <p<o. (3.49)

As a consequence of the relations (8.23), the TBA variables are related to those
of the NLIE, as follows:

lem =Y=aabl (3.50)

This allows one to express the generalized Gibbs potential and the free-energy flux
given in (8-57) in terms of our NLIE functions, as follows:

G(B) =-M [<> { cosh (x — i Zy) log %o(x) + cosh (x + i Fy) log auto),

—oo

f de :
(6) =—-M [> { sinh (x — i Zy) log %o(x) + sinh (x + i Fy) log (of.

(3.51)

The formulas (8.48) together with (8.47), (8.49) and (8:51) give the NLIE I formu-
lation of the generalized thermodynamics.

13
The main disadvantage of this formulation, is that the allowed range for the
contour deformation parameter becomes narrower and narrower as the value of N
increases. In this case, the difficulty comes from the fact that as the range of y
tightens, the integration contour is forced to run closer and closer to the line, where
infinitely many singularities of the unknown functions are condensated. In practice,
if N is large enough, numerical computations require taking very dense sampling
point distributions.

To avoid this scenario, in case the coupling constant is large enough, one can
derive another set of hybrid NLIE equations, which keep the massive TBA node and
sums up only the rest of the y—functions [51] [52]. This method works for 1 < p < ,
regime and we derive these equations in the next subsection.

3.4 Deriving NLIE II

In this section, we derive such an alternative hybrid-NLIE [44] [50) description of
the problem for 1 < p, which keeps the contributions of the massive TBA node and
sums up only the rest of the unknown functions of the TBA equations [5I] [52].

Now, the complex unknown functions of the equations are the / = 1 elements of
the set of variables (8:22):

3] p- 7.
b= “= ,  B=l+h= a
OI T+ _ _ Op, (3.52)
1= “on By =1+h=~ag

Using the results of the previous analyticity strip analysis (8.19)-(8.21), they have
the following analyticity properties:
b; and B,: is ANZSC in (—en, 2+ ey),

_ - 3.00
bj and B,: is ANZSC in (—2 — ey, ey). ( )

The unknown functions of the new set of equations called NLIE H, are y;, and the
appropriately contour shifted versions of b; and }, :

ay (x) = bi (a +i 7§), ay(x) = bi(a — iy),

A(z) =Biex+i7s), A(x) = By(w —i78), (3.54)

with 0 < y < 1. Then, using the functional relations (3-2), (8-4) and (8.23), one can
select the relevant ones:

viv, =, BY BY =%2, Ty Ty = Yo. (3.55)

14
Taking the logarithmic derivative of the relations (8.55), one ends up in Fourier-space
with the following expression for 7):

dlTs = 7 (4 dB, +q7 dB) (3.56)

+q 1!

With the help of a straightforward analysis of the log of relations (8.55), the following
equation can be derived for y; :

log yi(x) = log To(x) + (s!-7! * log 1) (a) + (sl % log 21)(x), (3.57)

where we exploited (8.54) and that Tp is a zero mode function Ty’ Ty = 1.
We just recall that around the real line, the exact functional form of To is known:

log To(x) = —Sy(2|8), —en < Ima < en, (3.58)

with Sy given in (2.9).
To work in Fourier space, we denote:

qn = dlr. (3.59)

Then, due to (11) and (21):
dQ =P? n. (3.60)
Using the definitions (8:52) together with the analyticity strip information (8.19)

and (8.21), one obtains the following equations among the Fourier-transforms of the
logarithmic derivatives:

db =P (1- Gq tq dt,
dB, = (1— 4) q +-dlTh,

dlby =F (P-%”® —1)q + dT,
dB, =f (4 - lq tdlty.

(3.61)

From the relation Ty‘ T, = Yi, coming from (3.4), one obtains in Fourier-space:

aly). (3.62)

~ 1
dT, =
q+

qt

Eliminating q, T, and T> from the equations (8.56), (8:61) and (8.62), one ends up
with:

15

dis = Ga Ey (az, diB,) iM.
a (qe — GF *) ye 5 qs (3-68)
dibs = get ag (az, dB) aah
or equivalently in the Fourier variable w :
db, (w) = Gya1(w) (dB, (w) - dlB,(w)) + 5(w)e7 2 dlY\(w),
_ a . At (3.64)
dlb,(w) = G,-1(w) (dBi (w) ~ dlBy(w)) +8(w)e? dlY;(w),

with G,(w) and 5(w) given in (8.44) and (8:33), respectively.
Finally, after integration and turning to the variables defined in (8:54), one ends
up with the equations in rapidity space:

log a;(a) = (G,-1 * log %1)(#) — cea * log ,)(x) + (s0—4 * log 4) (x),
log a(x) = (Gp_1 * log Ay) (wx) — es * log ,)(a) + (sl) x log Y,)(x), (3-65)
log y1(x) = log To(x) + (s!'~7! * log 2) (x) + (SY * log 21) (2),

where 0 < y < 1. Though, the equations were derived only at the positive integer
values of the coupling constant p = 2,3,..., they can be continued analytically to
he whole range, 2 < p in a straightforward manner.
It turns out that these equations can be further continued in p even to the
< p< 2 regime. The derivation of the equations was based on the analyticity
strips justified for 2 < p. Now, having the equations at hand, they can be continued
o the 1 < p < 2, regime, as well. Only, the kernel G,_; contains the p—dependence,
hus the analytical continuation to 1 < p < 2 seems to be straightforward. The
only subtlety comes from the allowed range of y. Namely, the closest to the real axis
poles of Gp_1(x) at +¢ (p—1) 7 should be avoided by the contour, which implies, the
0<y<p-—t1range. In summary, the allowed range for the contour deformation
parameter y in NLIE II (8.65) is as follows:

0<7<min(1,p-—1), l<p<o. (3.66)

The formulas for the generalized Gibbs potential and the free-energy flux remain
he same as in the TBA formulation (2-10):

G(8) =—M / a cosh (x) log Yi (2),

We close this section, with a short discussion on the applicability and benefits
of the two NLIE formulations.

NLIE I, has the main advantage that it is valid in the whole repulsive regime
of the theory, and depending on the value of the spin of the largest spin conserved
charge contained in the Gibbs potential, it can be valid in a certain neighborhood
of the free-fermion point in the attractive regime, as well. Nevertheless, the main
disadvantage of this formulation is that the analyticity strips for the unknown func-
tions become very narrow, when conserved charges with high spin are present in the
Gibbs ensemble. This implies that one has to integrate very closely to the infinitely
many singularities of the unknown functions, which require very dense distribution of
the sampling points, when numerical computations are done. Another issue arising
from the same source is that when all higher-spin conserved quantities are coupled
to the thermodynamic potential, the analyticity strip of the unknowns shrinks to
zero. This implies that the equations are no longer applicable in this regime.

As for NLIE II, in this case, there is no problem with neither the analyticity strips
nor the number of contained higher spin conserved quantities. The only restriction
of applicability is the range of coupling constant. It is narrower, than that of the
NLIE I, and looses efficiency as the free-fermion point p = 1 is closely approached.

Nevertheless, when only a few extra higher spin conserved quantities are coupled
to the thermodynamic potential, NLIE I, offers a still satisfactory description for
the thermodynamics, but in a wider range of coupling constant.

In the next section, we discuss, from the point of view of the particle content of
the theory, the reason why these restrictions on the validity of NLIE I arise in the
attractive regime.

4 Discussion of the attractive regime

This section explores how the particle spectrum of the theory accounts for the re-
stricted validity of NLIE I in the attractive regime.

Let us denote, the dimensionless spin-s conserved charges by Hs. Their action
on one-particle soliton (+) or anti-soliton (-) states with rapidity @ are, as follows:

Has|9, +) = H14(0) |9,+) =e*°9|0,+), 8 = 1,3,5,.... (4.1)

where the spin can take any odd integer value in the sine-Gordon model.
The general formula for the partition function (2.4) can be interpreted as the
partition function of a usual Gibbs ensemble, but with a generalized Hamiltonian

17
depending on the generalized inverse temperatures:

Z(8) =Tr 7 P Heen(B)
1 (4.2)

a a .
Hgen(B) = 3 So Boj—1 Hoja, b= ket
jez 8

In order for the partition function to exist, Hygen must be a lower bounded operator.
In the repulsive regime, when only solitons and anti-solitons form the spectrum of
the theory, the eigenvalues of higher-spin conserved charges on one-particle states are
positive. Namely, they are bounded from below. Thus, if all inverse temperatures are
positive, the generalized Hamiltonian becomes automatically bounded from below.
If one starts to penetrate into the attractive regime by decreasing the value of
p, the first breather enters the spectrum. If we restrict our attention to the range
1/2 < p < 1, only the first breather, the soliton and the anti-soliton form the
spectrum of the theory. Consequently, in the partition function (2.4), the breather
contributions will arise, as well. The corresponding one-particle eigenvalues, can be
computed using the bootstrap principle [I].

Hs |0, Bi) = Hp, +5(9) |, Br),

Ho, s(0) = Hts (9 +45 (1 5)) + Has (8-75 (1-5), (4.3)

He, tan—1)(0) = (—1)"*72 sin [2 n—1) a eten-De n=1,2,...

where Hg, +5(@) and H+,(0) are the B,-breather and the soliton or anti-soliton eigen-
values of the higher spin conserved quantities on a one-particle state with rapidity
6. As we mentioned earlier, for the soliton and anti-soliton states these eigenvalues
are always bounded from below in @. Unfortunately, this doesn’t hold for any value
of the coupling constant for the B, case. It turns out that H,,+4,.(0) is bounde
from below, only if:

1
1l--<p, s>0. (4.4
8

As the spin increases, the range in which the conserved charges remain bounded from
below becomes smaller and smaller. If only the first N higher-spin conserved charges
are included in the generalized Hamiltonian] (£2), then the condition ensuring tha
all contributing conserved charges are bounded from below is:

1

a ee 4.
\~ oy _7 =P 5

°This scenario corresponds to the source term Sy (29) in the NLIE or TBA formalism.

18
This is also the range of validity for NLIE I (8.48). Within this range, the generalized
Hamiltonian (42) is guaranteed to be bounded from below provided the generalized
inverse temperatures are positive. However, it may still be bounded from below
even when the condition (£5) is not satisfied. The key point is that NLIE I requires
a stronger condition: not just the full Hamiltonian, but each individual higher-spin
contribution must be bounded from below.

This distinction matters, as it limits the applicability of NLIE I beyond the
general requirement that Hegen be bounded from below. To illustrate this, consider
a simple example where the generalized Hamiltonian is:

Heen =H3 + 6H, with 0< f%. (4.6)

It is easy to show from (43) that this Hamiltonian is bounded from below for one-
particle B, states in the following range of the coupling constant:

4 2 1

~<p<>5<1--. 4.7

9 *PS3 9 (47)
Interestingly, this lies outside the NLIE I validity region, which requires 1 — 5 Lp,

This example clearly shows that NLIE I cannot account for all cases silinne the
generalized Hamiltonian is bounded from below. It only works in the more restric-
tive domain where each contributing higher-spin conserved charge is individually
bounded from below.

However, we are not claiming that no alternative to NLIE I exists in the regions
where it fails. It is possible that a more refined approach than the Thermodynamic
Bethe Ansatz (TBA) can be developed. What we emphasize is that the straightfor-
ward extension of the NLIE method, as presented in [35] [36] [37 38], is no longer
valid in those regions. To describe the thermodynamics of the model accurately, a
more sophisticated set of equations would be necessary.

5 Expectation values

In this section, we discuss, how the NLIE I and II formulations allow one to compute
expectation values of important operators in the theory.

5.1 Expectation values of conserved charges and their asso-
ciated currents

The averages of the local conserved charge densitied] q; and their associated currents
j; can be straightforwardly computed from both NLIE I and II, as the generating

®The connection with the notation introduced in (2-4) is Hi= fdxqi(x,t).

19
potentials of these quantities can be directly expressed in terms of the solutions of
the NLIEs.

In the sequel, we give formulas for the averages of dimensionless charge den-
sities and their associated currents. They can be computed by differentiating the
corresponding free-energy densities [18] [60]:

4s = (a(t, 0))9 = ZrO)

ji = ile.) = H(),

(5.1)

where the potentials G and ® are given in (8.51) and (8.67) for the NLIE I and
II formulations, respectively. As usual, after the differentiation, the averages are
expressed in terms of solutions to linear integral equations obtained by differentiating

the NLIE I (8.48) or II (8:65) equations.

5.2. Expectation values of local operators

Beyond computing the expectation values of conserved charges and the associated
currents, our NLIE formalism allows one to compute the expectation values of local
operators, as well.

Particularly, the expectation values of the vertex operators e*!”%se %) in the
sine-Gordon model, with m € N, become important, since they correspond to exper-
imentally measurable coherence factors in tunnel-coupled cold atomic condensates
(61, [62]. To keep the formulas as short as possible, we introduce the notation:

1
v= :
pti

The discovery of fermionic basis [53] (54) [55] [56] in the 6-vertex model, and
its application to the sine-Gordon model [57| makes the calculation of the vertex
operator expectation values possible.

The expectation values of vertex operators e’°sc%), take the form, as follows

[57 158}:

im Bo. is —2m? 1-4
(ef Bsc P@)) = 2 ( » C(O), det, Oy, m=1,2,... (5.2)

where for m > 0, Cin(a) is given by:

j=0

a l-v
and x = -—-+—_.
and x(a) 5 + yy
5.4)
The matrix elements of 2; take the form, as follows:

where the matrix elements w2,_1,1-2; involve the 3 dependence of the problem and
are the fundamental building blocks of the formula for expectation values of vertex
operators.

The parameter « in (6.2), is the coupling constant in the sine-Gordon action
(2.1). It is related to the soliton mass M, by the mass gap formula [59]:

aT(s L
K= Mv)’, where = II(v) = vee — T(v)¥. (5.6)

As for the formulas for w,_1,1-2;, we present them both in the NLIE I and
NLIE I formulations. To keep the formulas as short as possible, we present these
matrix elements, as derivatives of appropriate generating functions with respect to
the elements of the 6 vector.

Taking the explicit differentiations in (@.8), lead to expressions containing the

I (8.48) and II (8.65) equations.

6 Summary and discussion

In this paper we proposed two sets of nonlinear integral equations (NLIE) for de-
scribing the thermodynamics in the sine-Gordon model, when higher spin conserved
charges are also coupled to the Gibbs ensemble. The first one, called NLIE I formu-
lation is a direct extension of the Kliimper-Pearce-Bathchelor-Destri-de Vega type
[35] [36] equations to the case, when higher spin conserved charges are also included
in the partition function of the Gibbs ensemble.

The second one, called NLIE II, is a kind of hybrid-NLIE [44] [50) being valid
only in the repulsive regime, where the massive Y —function of the TBA formulation
is kept and only the rest of the complicated TBA system is summed up by a few
complex functions [51 [52].

The derivations of both sets of equations, are based on T — Q relations given
by the equivalent thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) formulation of the problem
in the repulsive regime. Though the equations are derived in the repulsive regime,
by appropriate analytical continuation, in case of NLIE I, the penetration into the
attractive regime is also possible. However, the magnitude of this penetration is
restricted by the spin of the largest spin conserved charge contained in the Gibbs
ensemble (3.49).

The main advantage of both sets of equations is that they are simple few com-
ponent equations and their coupling dependence is encoded into the kernel, which
allows simple analytical continuation in the coupling constant within their range of
validity.

Both sets of equations offer efficient frameworks for computing expectation values
of local conserved densities, their associated currents, and vertex operators and their
descendants, with respect to the generalized Gibbs ensemble.

Though, both sets of equations give the correct description of the generalized
hermodynamics in the sine-Gordon model, both formulations have their own advan-
ages and limitations. Thus, for specific purposes one should choose the appropriate
formulation.

The main restriction for the equations come from the shrinking of analyticity
domains, when the coupling constant p is approaching or going below the free-
fermion point (p = 1), or when more and more higher spin conserved charges are
coupled to the Gibbs ensemble.

As a summary, it can be stated that NLIE II is a perfect formulation of the
roblem in the whole repulsive regime p > 1, any number of higher conserved charges
can be coupled to the Gibbs ensemble. Expectation values of local densities, their
associated currents and vertex operators e+! %sc? and their descendants can be
computed without any difficulty. Some care is needed, only when the coupling
constant gets very close to the free-fermion point p = 1, since in this case the
integration contour runs close to the first pole of the kernel G,_1(x), which requires

22
more sampling points, when numerical integrations are carried out.

As for NLIE I, there is the shrinking of analyticity domains, as the spin of the
largest spin conserved charge contained in the generalized Gibbs ensemble, increases.
Because of this phenomenon, within this formulation only a finite number of higher
spin local conserved charges can be coupled to the Gibbs ensemble. If the largest
spin is 2. N —1, then the range of validity in the coupling constant is given by (8.49),

1 <p<o.

IN-1
Thus, this description can be still valid (beyond the repulsive regime) in the at-
tractive regime, in certain neighborhood of the free-fermion point. Within its range
of validity, it offers an efficient framework for computing the expectation values of
local densities, their associated currents and vertex operators e+’ %sc% and their
descendants.

Though, not discussed in this paper, NLIE I formulation perfectly fits into the
framework of [57] for computing ratios of expectation values of local operators.
Thus, NLIE I contrary to NLIE II, can describe ratios of expectation values of the
extended set of vertex operators corresponding to the perturbed complex Liouville
CFT description of the sine-Gordon model [57J. Namely, for example the ratios of
expectation values

(eti(m +4) Bee 2) 1

can also be computed by simply substituting into the formulas of references [57)[58},

but now changing the NLIE function to that of NLIE I, and applying a large enough
value for the contour deformation parameter.

A Some numerical results

This appendix is devoted to collecting numerical data for demonstrating that the
NLIE I description remains valid in the attractive regime, provided the coupling
constant remains within a suitable neighborhood of the free fermion point (8.49).
Table [I] contains some numerical data for the coupling constant dependence
of the Gibbs potential around the free fermion point, when at maximum spin-3
conserved charges are coupled to the thermodynamic potential and the soliton mass

23
M is set to be 1. The plot [I] gives the visual presentation of the same set of
numerical data. In view of these data, the continuity in the coupling constant is
plausible.

Nevertheless, to give more evidence on the continuous transition between the
repulsive and attractive regimes, we numerically computed the first two derivatives
of the thermodynamic potential at the free fermion point in two ways. First from
numerical data corresponding to the repulsive regime, and then from data coming
from the attractive regime, and we checked that the numerical values of the first
wo derivatives do not depend on the regime where we computed them. This is a
very strong numerical evidence of the correctness of the NLIE I description in the
attractive regime.

Table] contains the numerical data for the computation of the numerical deriva-
ives. We used higher order formulas for the numerical computations of the deriva-
ives.

Let h be a small positive number used for computing the derivatives numeri-
cally, and let f(|p) be an arbitrary function of the vector of generalized inverse
emperatures and the coupling constant p. Denote:

fy =F(Bll+jh), fg =+1,+2,48,....

These are the discrete values of the function from which the numerical derivatives
around the p = 1 free-fermion point are computed.
We note that in our actual numerical computations we choose h = 1073 for the
value of h. Thus, the data in table [2] was generated by this choice for h.
Then the first numerical derivative at p = 1, can be computed by the following
2nd order formulas. Repulsive regime:

Attractive regime:

Using the data given in table 2] one obtains for the derivatives of G:

order formulas.

These results are consistent with the O(h?) ~ 107° error dictated by the second
order numerical derivative formulas.

These numerical computations provide strong evidence for the validity of NLIE
I in the attractive regime sufficiently close to the free fermion point (8.49). Using
numerical derivative computations on both sides of the free-fermion point, we were
able to show with high precision that, at this point, not only the curve (obtained
from the solutions of NLIE I) in figure [I] but also at least its first and second
derivatives are continuous.
