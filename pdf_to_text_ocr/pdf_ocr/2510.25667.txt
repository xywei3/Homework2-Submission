Asstract: Infrared quantum dots, operating in the near-infrared (NIR, 700-1400 nm), short-
wavelength infrared (SWIR, 1400-3000 nm), mid-infrared (MIR, 3000-8000 nm) and long-wavelength
infrared (LWIR, 8000-15000 nm) regions, have promising potential in optoelectronics, nanotechnol-
ogy and military surveillance applications. The properties of infrared quantum dots exhibit quantum
confinement effects, unlike bulk semiconductors, where their bandgap energy and emission wave-
length can be precisely tuned by controlling particle size, composition, and surface chemistry.
The wide tunability and unique quantum confinement effects in these infrared-emitting materials
also make them attractive for both fundamental research, health and space technology. This paper
focuses on the synthesis, fabrication and characterisation of polymer-based infrared quantum dots
and explores the possible applications of infrared quantum dots in high-energy physics, medicine
and astrophysics.

1 Introduction

Infrared (IR) Quantum Dots (QDs), which have emission and absorption beyond the UV-vis elec-
tromagnetic spectrum region, are semiconductor nanocrystals that exhibit size-tunable optical and
electronic properties that are very interesting for telecommunications, infrared photodetectors, solar
cells, and night-vision systems.[1—7]. The development of IR QDs relies on advanced colloidal
synthesis techniques [8, 9] which allow precise control over the size, composition, and surface prop-
erties of QDs, which are critical for achieving desired optical and electronic characteristics [10, 11].
Notable materials used for IR QDs include lead chalcogenides (PbS, PbSe), III-V semiconductors
(InAs, InSb), and emerging perovskite-based nanocrystals [12-15]. IR QDs have been extensively
studied for their use in optoelectronic devices, such as photodetectors, light-emitting diodes (LEDs),
and solar cells. Their tunable band gaps enable efficient light absorption and emission, which is
particularly useful for telecommunications and night vision technologies [16]. The ability of IR
QDs to absorb light in the IR spectrum also makes them excellent candidates for next-generation
solar cells. These QDs are being integrated into multijunction solar cells to extend the absorption
range and improve energy conversion efficiencies [17]. Additionally, multiple-exciton generation
(MEG) in QDs has the potential to surpass the Shockley-Queisser efficiency limit of conventional
photovoltaic materials [18]. Recent research includes the introduction of core-shell structures,
such as PbSe/CdSe or InAs/CdSe with optimised photoluminescence quantum yields, also with
the aim to mitigate environmental degradation [19-24]. The experimental approach of producing
Polymer-based infrared-emitting quantum dots having promising optical properties, along with the
application perspectives of IR QDs in various technological sectors, will be presented in the next
sections.

2 Experimental Results and Discussions

2.1 Experimental Technique

In this experimental work, the synthesis of the IR QDs involves colloidal synthesis of a mixture
of nanoparticles doped with trivalent rare-earth ions, followed by dispersion in a toluene solution,
mixing with PDMS polymer. Rare-earth ions play a pivotal role in enhancing the performance of
optical detectors, laser systems, display technologies, and telecommunication applications. Triva-
lent rare-earth (RE) ions doped in semiconductor QDs show excellent luminescence properties
because of the intra-configurational transitions of 4f electrons shielding well 5s and 5p electrons
[25, 26]. Researchers have shown RE ions doping in QDs for use in different applications such
as optical converters (down and up-conversion), solid lasers, and optical amplifiers [27]. In recent
years, down-conversion materials (such as RE ion-doped QDs) have been investigated in many stud-

ies because of their potential to increase solar cell efficiency and protection [28]. The chemicals
used for the synthesis and fabrication of the infrared quantum dots are Erbium (III) nitrate pentahy-
drate, Zirconyl chloride octahydrate, Propionic acid, Isopropanol, Magnesium nitrate hexahydrate,
Ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, Heptane, Toluene and Sylgard PDMS, purchased from Sigma
Aldrich. The prepared QDs were spin-coated onto a 30 x 20mm? quartz silica substrate at 3000
rpm revolution speed for 40 seconds, followed by UV exposure and a baking step at 100° C for
12 min. The fabricated thin film having quantum dots has been denoted here as IR QD. The
surface morphology of the IR QDs has been characterised by Field Emission Scanning Electron
Microscopy (FESEM), SUPRA 55 VP-4132 CARL ZEISS, X-ray Diffraction (CRD) measurement
with a Rigaku X-ray Diffractometer. The transmittance measurement of IR QDs has been carried
out by a PerkinElmer Lambda 1050 UV-visible-NIR spectrometer. The FLS1000 photolumines-
cence spectrometer with a semiconductor laser diode emitting at 980 nm has been used to measure
photoluminescence emission spectra and lifetimes of the IR QDs in the NIR (1400 to 1700 nm).

2.2 Morphological and Structural Properties
2.2.1 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM)

Figure | shows FESEM images of IR QDs, which reveal that the nanoparticles exhibit a smooth
surface with minimal roughness or defects with no apparent pores, cracks, or irregularities, indicat-
ing good crystallinity. The QD nanoparticles are clear with an average diameter of 11.8 nm, and
are predominantly rhombohedral with few spherical or quasi-spherical rounded contours. While
most particles are uniform, a few show slight elongation or irregularity, possibly due to coalescence
during synthesis or drying [29]. There is negligible aggregation, suggesting soft agglomeration,
which is common in nanoparticles due to high surface energy and van der Waals attractions [30-33].
No large-scale sintering or fusion is observed.

XRD analysis was performed for the IR QDs as shown in Figure 2 with respective diffraction
angle, FWHM, d-spacing, Miller index (hkl) values, respectively, within 20 (scan range 10 -

International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD) card number 04-005-5490 with rhombohedral
crystal structure and with no additional impurity phase. The XRD pattern has several diffraction
peaks at 26 and the corresponding reflection from crystallographic planes or Miller index (hkl)
are shown in Table 1. The dominant diffraction peak observed around 31.6° is accompanied by a
shoulder near 33.0°, suggesting either overlapping reflections from closely spaced crystallographic
planes or contributions from multiple phases [34, 35]. The corresponding interplanar spacings (d)
are calculated for the mentioned (hkl) values in Table 1 using Bragg’s law, nA = 2d sin@, where
A = 0.15406 nm is the X-ray wavelength, @ is the diffraction angle in the XRD pattern, and ’n’
is the order of reflection (n=1). The sharpness of the peaks indicates a relatively well-crystallised
material with no amorphous content, matching well with the observed and computer-calculated

Figure 3 illustrates the PL emission spectra of IR QD under a 980 nm excitation of the
semiconductor diode laser measured at moderate temperature. The IR QDs have a strong PL
emission with a narrow band at 1540 nm with a calculated full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of
24.69 nm. This narrow FWHM indicates that the quantum dots are all of very similar size; these IR
QDs are thus highly suitable for optoelectronic applications, having promising best-in-class optical
properties. The transmittance spectrum has been investigated over the spectral range from 1400 nm
to 1700 nm and is compared with the transmittance of the supporting matrix PDMS sample [44, 45]
(Figure 3).

QDs.

3 Future Perspectives for High Energy Physics

With the experimental results indicating that these IR QDs show promise, their implementation
in high-energy physics, specifically in dark matter detection, fixed-target experiments, or collider
experiments, can be considered. Recent studies propose leveraging QDs as scintillating targets to
detect sub-GeV dark matter through electron interactions. The high photoluminescence quantum
yield and tunability of QDs allow for the detection of low-energy events, providing a new avenue
for direct dark matter searches.

One of the possible applications of the IR QDs can also be in the area of data transmission.
Silicon transparency beyond roughly 1200 nm opens an infrared window that can be explored with
high-energy physics detectors. By embedding 1310 to 1550 nm optical links directly on tracker
modules, modulated light can pass hundreds of microns of silicon with negligible attenuation,
reducing copper mass and heat, although coping with multi terabyte per second hit rates anticipated
at the HL-LHC and future colliders [47] will require faster PL decay times than currently achieved.
Radiation-tolerant silicon photonics platforms that integrate Ge on Si photodiodes, Mach Zehnder
or electro absorption modulators, and on-chip wavelength division multiplexers have withstood total

? in recent irradiation

ionising doses exceeding one Grad and neutron fluences beyond 10!” neg cm7
campaigns [48], foreshadowing lightweight fibre sparse readout architectures.

This same IR transparency of (non fully metalised back plane) silicon detectors can also enable
the development of detectors where IR emitting quantum dots are placed closer to the interaction
point of collider experiments than the multi-layer vertex tracking detectors typically constructed
from multiple layers of silicon pixel and strip detectors. Colloidal nanodots can be deposited with
sub-100 nm precision on an O(jm)-thick substrate where the locations of the nanodots are defined
through electron beam lithography of a (dissolvable) PMMA template [49]. As sketched in figure 5,
individual layers consisting of, e.g. 200 nm wide strips (of quantum dots emitting at a defined
layer-dependent wavelength) every 1 micron can thus be constructed. The number of layers and the
periodicity are determined by the number of uniquely identifiable nanodot wavelengths, which in
turn is influenced by their emission linewidth. If multiple layers are precisely positioned relative to
each other (e.g. using ultrasonic linear piezo stages that are precise down to tens of nm) and stacked,
a staggered luminescent structure can be assembled, each layer emitting at a different wavelength.
If a charged particle traverses this stack, the detection of fluorescence photons produced as the
particle traverses a specific group of nanodots allows for the unique assignment of the detected
fluorescence photon through its wavelength to a particular quantum dot strip, with potentially 100
nm precision, modulo the overall periodicity. Disambiguation within this overall periodicity (1
micron in this example) is achieved by extrapolating the charged particle trajectory reconstructed
using the surrounding silicon micropatterned detectors. Although fluorescence photons can be
optically imaged behind the (IR-transparent) silicon layers and their arrival times can be measured,
only a limited reconstruction of their origin is possible. The scheme, which still needs to be validated
experimentally, is thus limited with respect to the maximal local track density. Different nearby
tracks cannot be uniquely assigned a particular photon wavelength, and hence a nanodot position.

Infrared light is equally powerful for alignment, calibration, and low-threshold calorimetry.
Silicon strip and pixel sensors behave as semi-transparent photodiodes, so passing narrow-band
infrared lasers through the sensitive volume enables micron-scale deformation monitoring, an
approach realised in the CMS laser alignment system that drives forty 1075 nm beams through 434
tracker modules [50]. Studies for the International Linear Collider have demonstrated implant
layouts and antireflection treatments that raise silicon transmittance to about 50% near 1080 nm
while preserving charge-collection efficiency. Quantum dot films tuned to telecom wavelengths can
add bright monochromatic beacons or up-conversion layers on sensor surfaces. In contrast, noble
gaseous and crystalline scintillators possess secondary emission bands between 850 and 1600 nm

Figure 5. Schematic of a five-layer IR quantum dot chromatic tracker. The track is extrapolated towards
the chromatic layer from the multi-layer silicon tracker (the individual and extrapolated hit uncertainties are
schematically indicated in black); the detected IR photon then allows uniquely assigning the corresponding

PMMA template (light green) defines the 200 nm wide troughs in which the nanodots are deposited. Prior
to assembly, the PMMA is dissolved (not shown).

that, when coupled to InGaAs avalanche photodiodes, deliver dual colour timing and sub-electron-
volt thresholds for dark matter or axion searches. Looking forward, a coordinated programme
that qualifies silicon photonic components under radiation, refines sensor processing for infrared
transparency, and engineers quantum dot coatings that remain robust above 500 kGy promises to
embed infrared functionality throughout future experiments. The expected benefits span massless
data links, self-calibrating trackers, and quantum-enhanced rare event detectors, highlighting how
advances in telecom and quantum information technology can be repurposed to meet the extreme
environments and precision demands of next-generation particle physics.
4 Future Perspectives for Medicine

The tunability of the infrared quantum dots in the near-infrared (NIR, 700-1400 nm) and mid-infrared
(MIR, 3000-8000 nm) ranges is extraordinarily promising for medical imaging. Infrared-emitting
quantum dots are capable of wider and broader access to tagging drugs in infected tissue with higher
resolution in comparison to visible quantum dots due to fewer photons getting absorbed and diffused
in the infrared region [51, 52]. The attractive biocompatibility of the infrared quantum dots is very
promising, and experimentally synthesised IR QDs can be a potential candidate for both in vitro
and in vivo medical imaging. They can serve as fluorescent markers in biological tissues, with the
potential to provide high photoluminescence quantum yields without toxicity, given their absence
of heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and cadmium. Surface coating of QDs with peptides or other
biomolecules that selectively bind to specific molecular targets, such as lipids in cell membranes,
receptors, or other biomolecular markers, is a well-developed area in bioconjugation and targeted
imaging, merging nanomaterials with biochemistry [53].

Such coatings facilitate advanced biosensing applications, wherein the interaction between the
target molecule and the quantum dot modulates its fluorescence characteristics through mechanisms
such as Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) or fluorescence quenching [54]. This enables
drug delivery tracking [55], where functional peptides act as targeting ligands for drug-loaded QDs
(or QD-containing nanocarriers), and pathogen detection [56], where many viruses and bacteria in-
teract with specific lipid components or lipid-binding peptides. The study of membrane biophysics,
where peptide-functionalized QDs can be used as nanoscale probes to track the dynamics of lipid
rafts [57], of vesicle fusion, or of membrane curvature changes [58].

This technology can be enhanced and optimised further by binding IR-emitting QDs with pep-
tides or biomolecules. This approach shows promise in deep-tissue imaging, targeted sensing [59],
and theranostics through the combination of targeted peptides with IR-QD fluorescence. Combining
drug payload with a lipid-targeting angle of incorporating membrane-insertive peptide sequences to
guide IR-QDs into lipid-rich tumour membranes to deliver photothermal or photodynamic therapy
agents can also track treatment progress in deep tissue [60].

IR light has the capability to penetrate biological tissue better than visible light with Near-
IR (NIR, 700-1400 nm) and Short-Wave IR (SWIR, 1000-1700 nm) QDs [61] having reduced
scattering and lower autofluorescence. This can enable non-invasive visualisation of molecular
lipid distributions in living animals, which can also be applied to in vivo molecular sensing by
targeting specific peptides with IR-QDs bound to a lipid target, followed by localisation of the
signal to specific regions via optical readout through tissue.

Also, IR-QDs are photostable and bright, allowing the tracking of single lipid molecules labelled
with QD-peptide conjugates inside a living animal, even through thick tissue layers [62]. Another
promising application is in nanodosimetry for particle (proton and ion) therapy treatment planning
[63]. Radiation damage to genes or cells begins with initial damage to DNA segments (depending
on the number of relevant particle interactions) and, consequently, to particle track structures a
few nanometers in size. The infrared quantum dots can be applied in nanodosimetric detectors
for absolute prediction, detection and measurements of radiation damage in multiple sites of DNA
lesion clusters, which is also expected to contribute to radiation protection as regular DNA damage
leads towards cancer [64]. The future of IR QDs in medicine lies in highly bright, biocompatible,
and multifunctional nanoprobes that integrate deep-tissue imaging, precision therapy, and real-time
monitoring. A primary research focus will be on developing non-toxic, heavy-metal-free IR QDs, as
well as improving biocompatibility, clearance, and regulatory acceptance for human applications.
With advances in material engineering, imaging technologies, and safety profiles, IR QDs are
expected to transition from preclinical research to clinical applications within the coming decade.

5 Future Perspectives for Space and Astrophysics

Building on the wavelength-multiplexed filter-array spectrometer as proposed in [65], IR-QDs can
be composition and size-engineered so that each sub-filter exhibits a distinct absorption band across
the mid and long-wave IR. After calibrating the filter-wavelength response, the resulting sensing
matrix can be inverted using regularised algorithms to reconstruct the incident spectrum on a
single detector or a compact focal-plane imager, extending grating-free QD spectrometers from the
visible/NIR into the MWIR and well into the LWIR. Together with modern reconstruction methods
for miniaturised computational spectrometers [66], IR-QD filter arrays offer a path to compact,
low-SWaP spectrometers that broaden spectral coverage for planetary and lunar remote-sensing
payloads.

This IR-QD spectrometer concept aligns with NASA Goddard’s spacecraft-as-sensor vision,
where printed QD spectrometers turn spacecraft surfaces into lightweight, distributed sensing
arrays [65, 67]. Using IR-active QDs would extend this platform from the visible/NIR into the
MWIR/LWIR, enabling in-situ thermal and chemical mapping while meeting strict size, weight,
and power constraints.

The most immediate aerospace use at these wavelengths is free-space optical (FSO) commu-
nications for inter-satellite links and space-to-ground downlinks. In this case, the QD will be used
as an emitter. The FSO systems commonly favour ~ 1550 nm carriers because of eye-safety limits
and reduced solar/sky background, while still offering high data-rate, narrow-beam links; the Deep
Space Optical Communications (DSOC) further underscores the viability of 1.55 yum hardware
for deep-space regimes [68, 69]. QD emitters near 1.5 yum therefore align with established op-
tics, InGaAs detectors, and silicon-photonics components, enabling low-cost, arrayed transmitters,
modulated beacons, and redundant optical crosslinks [70].

Beyond links, 1.5 zm QD emitters enable cooperative optical navigation (formation-flying bea-
cons/retroreflector tracking) and are strong candidates for eye-safer, short-range lidar/altimetry in
proximity operations; they also serve as compact, spectrally tailorable in-flight calibration sources
for SWIR imagers and as luminescent coatings for remote thermometry of structures and thermal-
protection systems [69, 71-74]. Emerging integration of PbS-QD optoelectronics with SiN waveg-
uides points to fully integrated on-chip emitters/detectors and calibration modules at ~ 1.55 ym for
cubesat-class platforms [73].

6 Conclusion and Outlook

In summary, infrared quantum dots are a promising and advancing technology with application
prospects in optoelectronics, photovoltaics, high-energy physics, medicine, and space. Their ad-
vantages include bright, tunable fluorescence; reduced photobleaching compared to organic dyes
for data transmission; suitability for chromatic tracking, advanced bioimaging, and diagnostics;
fluorescence-guided surgery with real-time visualisation; integration with Al-driven imaging sys-
tems; theranostics; and targeted and personalised medicine, with enhanced biosafety regulations.
Future research should focus on enhancing the scalability and stability of infrared quantum dots,
advancing surface engineering, developing non-toxic, heavy-metal-free infrared quantum dots, and
defect passivation, aiming to create high-performance infrared quantum dots with superior sen-
sitivity and efficiency. Furthermore, scalable continuous-flow synthesis and standardised testing
protocols can be key factors in industrial adoption, unlocking the full potential of IR QDs for
next-generation imaging, sensing, medical, high-energy physics, and space technologies.
