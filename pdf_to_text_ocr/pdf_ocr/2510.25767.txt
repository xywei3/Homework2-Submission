We summarize key experimental studies of the low energy properties of overdoped cuprate
high temperature superconductors and conclude that a theoretical understanding of the “essen-
tial physics” is achievable in terms of a conventional Fermi-liquid treatment of the normal state,
and a BCS mean-field treatment of the (d-wave) superconducting state. For this perspective to be
consistent, it is necessary to posit that there is a crossover from a strongly correlated underdoped
regime (where a different theoretical perspective is necessary) to the more weakly correlated over-
doped regime. It is also necessary to argue that the various observed features of the overdoped
materials that are inconsistent with this perspective can be attributed to the expected effects of the
intrinsic disorder associated with most of the materials being solid state solutions (alloys). As a test
of this idea, we make a series of falsifiable predictions concerning the expected behavior of “ideal”

(disorder free) overdoped cuprates.

I. INTRODUCTION

Background: The search for a theoretical under-
standing of the experimentally documented properties
of the cuprate high temperature superconductors has
layed a central role in condensed matter physics for al-
most four decades, in large part because these materials
have been more intensively and incisively studied than
any other correlated electronic material. Influential and
roadly relevant ideas that germinated from such studies
include the physics of quantum antiferromangets (includ-
ing possible spin-liquids) and doped antiferromagnets,
novel forms of charge, spin, current, and superconduct-
ing density wave orders, electronic analogues of various
liquid crystalline phases, ways in which usual notions of
metallic physics can break-down (non-Fermi liquid be-
haviors), bold new approaches to obtaining controlled
numerical) solutions of model problems - such as the
Hubbard model - and a host of more phenomenological
ideas focused on various experimental observations. In-
deed, the observation of multiple novel behaviors in these
materials justifies this exuberant exploration of various
interesting observed phenomena.

One notable feature of this field is the enormous effort
that has been devoted to obtaining exquisite control of
the materials involved. Results in the field are now highly
reproducible. However, one key feature we will stress is
that this does not mean that the effects of “disorder”
can be neglected. Most of the materials involved are al-
loys, meaning that even in “perfect” materials, there is
inherent disorder associated with the random configura-
tion of dopant atoms. While we are certainly interested
in the measured properties of the actual materials, it is
also useful to ask what the features of a putative “ideal”
(i.e. disorder free) cuprate would be.

A central set of questions in the field concern the na-
ture of the superconducting state itself: Why is T, so
high? What limits T.? Why do the phase diagrams
of many families of cuprates exhibit a relatively simi-
lar superconducting “dome?” What do we learn from
the cuprates about unconventional superconductivity in
other material systems?

Foreground: In this article (which is a perspective,
not a review), we analyze the evidence that the supercon-
ducting dome in an “ideal” disorder free cuprate would
arise as a consequence of a crossover from a strongly
correlated (and hence very complex) underdoped regime
where 7), is intrinsically determined by phase ordering,
to an overdoped regime in which a weak coupling per-
spective based on a Fermi liquid normal state and a BCS
mean-field description of the superconducting transition
is possible. As part of this analysis, we present reasons to
attribute to the effects of disorder those observed features
of actual overdoped cuprates that are inconsistent with
a weak-coupling description. Our perspective is summa-
rized in Fig. 1, for which the essential assumptions are:

© p < Popt: There is an underdoped (UD) regime that
may be best thought of as a lightly doped antifer-
romagnetic insulator. Here, the pairing scale |Ao|
is large compared to the superconducting T,. Con-
versely, the energy scale that characterizes the stiff
ness to phase fluctuations,[1] JT», is small compared to
Ao|/2. Consequently, T, is the temperature at which
phase fluctuations, rather than thermal pair-breaking,
destroy long-range order. This hierarchy of scales,
Ao|/2 > T. * Ty, is inverted from the usual weak-
coupling case, and so likely reflects strong-coupling
physics. Indeed, in this regime of doping there is direct
evidence for various types of “intertwined” density-
wave-orders (which are generically strong-coupling ef-
ects) and a host of fluctuation phenomena which have
been linked under the name “pseudo-gap phenomena.”
There is no generally accepted theory that describes
he rich physics of the underdoped regime.

The red shaded region indicates a crossover from an effective
Fermi-liquid-like overdoped regime to a highly correlated un-
derdoped regime, where the normal state is not well described
in terms of weakly interacting quasi-particles, and where vari-
ous forms of intertwined order further complicate matters. At
low doping, the blue region contains various phases with (at
low T) long range antiferromagnetic order - either commen-
surate or incommensurate - and various forms of hole crys-
tals, ranging from hole-Wigner crystals at the lowest doping
to stripe-ordered insulators at higher doping. Aspects of this
conjectured phase diagram are inconsistent with experiments,
as can be seen, for example, in Figs. 2 and 3; we attribute
these discrepancies to the effects of disorder.

© p > Poptt On the overdoped (OD) side of the super-
conducting dome, Figure | shows Ty > T. © |Ao|/2,
the familiar hierarchy present in BCS superconductors.
Confirming this behavior would constitute strong evi-
dence of the applicability of a weak-coupling perspec-
tive. Correspondingly, the normal state, with super-
conductivity suppressed either with increasing temper-
ature or magnetic field, should be well captured by the
usual Fermi liquid theory of metals.

© Pp ~ Popt: For a range of doping in the vicinity of op-
timal doping, p = popt, there is a regime where both
|Ao|/2 and Ty are comparable to T,. This is a crossover
regime, where presumably no single perspective can
easily capture all of the physics.

The perspective presented here is quite different than
a widely discussed perspective in which optimal doping
is associated with a quantum critical point whose influ-
ence dominates large portions of the phase diagram. [2-4]
Our perspective does not preclude the existence of one or
more quantum critical points with pe S popr. However,
it assumes that no putative critical fluctuations play an
essential role in the SC pairing, at least for p 2 popt.

The main point: It is the primary purpose of this
paper to critically asses the validity of this weak cou-
pling perspective as it relates to the overdoped cuprates.
(While most theoretical studies of the cuprates have em-
hasized more exotic, strong coupling aspects of the
roblem, there is a significant subset that overlap ei-
cher in some details or in perspective with the present
approach [5-13].) Specifically, we identify the experi-
mental evidence that supports this perspective, and per-
haps more importantly observations that clearly contra-
dict it. For example, several families of cuprates exhibit
che “boomerang effect,” where Ty decreases with increas-
ing p such that it remains comparable to T. through-
out the overdoped regime[|4—17]. Moreover, when su-
perconductivity is suppressed with a high magnetic field,
“strange metal” behavior (as opposed to the expected
Fermi-liquid behavior) is seen throughout the overdoped
range of p [18, 19]. We will discuss reasons to think
hat these features—those that challenge our perspec-
ive when taken at face value—are the consequence of
intrinsic alloy-disorder.

Along these lines, we present evidence that the ap-
parent failures of the weak-coupling perspective are less
pronounced in materials in which such intrinsic disorder
is arguably weaker. The sketched phase diagram more-
over stands as a falsifiable prediction - if experiments are
carried out in materials with less intrinsic disorder (e.g.
stoichiometric crystals) and they fail to produce results
that are increasingly consistent with the sketched phase
diagram, then the underlying theory cannot be correct.

Another outcome of our discussion will be to adduce
evidence—under the assumption that the weak-coupling
analysis is reasonable for p > po,,—that the pairing in-
eraction does not support the idea that a putative quan-
um critical point at p* ~ pop: plays a significant role in
superconductivity. This argument complements an ear-
ier argument[1(6] supporting the same conclusion based
on the smooth doping dependence of the superfluid re-
sponse of LSCO for a range of p from po,, to the edge of
he superconducting dome.

There is a lot riding on this. Admittedly, without ad-
dressing the crossover to the strongly correlated physics
on the UD side of the phase diagram, we cannot claim
o fully understand superconductivity at optimal dop-
ing, nor why T,, drops with underdoping. However, if the
present perspective is verified, it gives us an understand-
ing of high temperature superconductivity from the OD
side. As the cuprates are the best characterized of all
unconventional SCs, even this partial understanding has
broad implications for the field.

From the weak-coupling perspective, there are two key
features of the cuprates: i) a band-structure with a large
density of states near the (0,7) and (7,0) points in the

BZ, and ii) a k dependent repulsive interaction peaked
near Q@ = (7,7), ie. the vector that connects the high
density of states regions. (The presence of this interac-
tion is, in turn, reflected in the existence of pronounced
short-range magnetic correlations with roughly the same

ordering vector.) This invites us in searching for new high
temperature superconductors to look for band-structure
motifs and magnetic correlations that remind us of the
cuprates, rather than trying to reproduce the local solid
state chemistry.

II. WHAT IS A BCS SUPERCONDUCTOR?

Using the words “BCS” and “cuprate” in the same
sentence is obviously provocative. As elaborated below,
we apply the term ‘BCS superconductor’ to a situation
in which the superconducting state emerges as a weak-
coupling instability from a Fermi liquid normal state, in-
dependent of whether phonons play a role in the mecha-
nism or not.

In what sense are “conventional” superconductors
described by BCS theory?

The properties of crystalline (“clean”) conventional su-
erconductors can be derived from the electron-phonon
roblem using the Migdal-Eliashberg (ME) approxima-
ion. Unlike the original BCS theory, which abstracts
away the pairing mechanism with a generic attractive
otential, ME explicitly keeps both the electrons and the
“bosonic glue,” i.e. phonons.

At temperatures T > hwp (where wp a characteris-
ic phonon frequency - e.g. the Debye frequency), the
quasi-particle lifetime (in both theory and experiment)
is h/t = 27AoT’, where Ao is the dimensionless (unrenor-
malized) electron-phonon coupling constant. It is not
immediately obvious that Fermi liquid theory applies at
hese temperatures, where quasiparticles (in the Landau
sense) are at best marginally well defined [20]. However,
if one is only interested in treating the problem at tem-
eratures, T, and energies, iw, small compared to hwp,
hen it is possible to introduce (as was done from the first
y BCS) a simpler low-energy description of the system
in terms of well defined Landau quasi-particles with a
weak residual interaction proportional to the dimension-
less parameter, A — yu*. Here, X ~ Ap/(1+ Ao), and p*
are renormalized versions of the dimensionless electron-
honon and electron-electron interactions. Formally, this
“effective field theory” can be derived[21—23] from the
original problem by integrating out degrees of freedom
with energies larger than ~ hwp, so that hwp appears
only as the high energy cuttoff of the theory. '

1 There are a few subtleties concerning the BCS perscription for
integrating out the phonons that are worth mentioning: i) As
there are always acoustic phonons, it is not literally the case
that all the phonons get integrated out in this process. However,
these modes do not couple strongly to the electrons - both be-
cause of limited phase space and the fact that, being Goldstone
modes, they only have derivative couplings to electrons. They

It is interesting to note that an essential piece of the
evidence that the “mechanism” of pairing is a phonon-
induced attraction between electrons comes from analyz-
ing the energy dependence of the gap function, A(k,w),
at energy scales hw ~ hwp, i.e. at energies where Lan-
dau quasiparticles are not sharply defined. In the context
of the upcoming discussion of the overdoped cuprates, a
take-away message is that the observation of non-Fermi-
liquid-like properties at energies much greater than T,—
for example in photoemission or optical spectroscopy—
does not preclude the applicability of a weak-coupling
BCS perspective at low energies. To gain additional in-
sight, let us look at a conventional superconductor from
a low T, low energy empirical perspective and imagine
trying to infer something about the pairing mechanism.
To begin with, we would note that if we suppress SC with
a magnetic field, we would see well-defined quantum os-
cillations (QOs) - telling us that the normal state is a
FL metal. From the facts that the gap vanishes at Ti,
chat T,. is (up to corrections that are never more than 20-
30% effects) is equal to |Ao|/2, and that thermodynamic
uantities, such as the specific heat, show mean-field like
behavior, we would be confident that a mean-field de-
scription is warranted. Finally, once we succeeded in
measuring the gap function, A(k,w), we would see that

it is only weakly k dependent: from this we would infer
chat pairing is induced by an effective attractive interac-
‘ion that is local (short-ranged) in space. That is to say,
we would identify phenomena that are consistent with
she underlying assumptions of BCS theory.

More detailed information about the pairing mecha-
nism is somewhat hidden in this BCS approach. In prin-
ciple, the attractive interaction could come from some-
ching other than phonons. Indeed, this is the sense in
which we are suggesting that overdoped cuprates can
be described by BCS theory: it is clear that the pair-
ing interaction in the cuprates is not, primarily, due to
phonons, and yet we will argue that a BCS perspective
is warranted. 7

When are fluctuations negligible?

BCS theory is a mean-field theory and therefore is only
valid so long as fluctuation effects are negligible. In prin-
ciple, close enough to T’,, universal critical fluctuations

can thus be neglected. ii) Even at low T, there can be dynami-
cal effects - such as relaxation of non-equilibrium populations of
quasi-particles - that cannot be well understood in terms of the
effective field theory, but require a theory in which phonons are
included explicitly.

It is also not entirely true that there are no signatures of the
mechanism; in conventional SCs, the importance of phonons can
(often) be derived from the isotope dependence of the cutoff in
the theory, an observation that played an essential role in the
acceptance of BCS theory.
must arise, meaning that BCS theory is never applica-
ble. However, in conventional superconductors, signifi-
cant fluctuation effects are confined to extremely narrow
regimes about T,, (of order 10~®7, [24]).

While there are multiple possible sorts of fluctuation
effects that can give corrections to BCS theory, particu-
larly important in the cuprate context are “phase fluctu-
ations.” In the SC state below T., the low energy physics
is universally captured by the non-linear sigma model,

tromagnetic vector potential. Importantly, « is a mea-
surable quantity: in 3d, «(T’) = [(fc)?/16me?] A~?(T)
where \ is the London penetration depth. We define an
energy scale associated with phase fluctuations as

kpTo(T) = x(T)L4-? (2)

where L is an appropriate microscopic length scale that
rovides a UV cutoff to the theory. (We will adopt the
notation Ty = Tg(T' = 0).) Of particular interest here is
hat in d = 2, « has units of energy. For a layered system
of weakly Josephson coupled superconducting planes, the
appropriate length scale is L = c, i.e. the spacing be-
ween planes. (More generally, L is the larger of c and
he superconducting coherence length, €., in the inter-
lane direction.) *

The meaning of this energy scale is that thermal phase
fluctuations are dilute (and hence in certain senses neg-
igible) so long as the temperature is much less than
To(T), while they have an order one effect on the physics
when the temperature is of order Tg(T) or greater. Close
enough to T., phase fluctuations are always important:
In 2D, as T > T, from below, To(T) > (2/7)Ty (ie.
here is a universal drop of the phase stiffness at T.).
n 3D (to the extent that gauge-field fluctuations can
e ignored), Ty goes to zero as T — T>, with univer-
sal 3D XY critical exponents. However, in both cases,
if at low temperatures Ty >> T,, it is only in a range of
emperatures of order AT ~ T,(T../To) that phase fluc-
uations are expected to be important. Thus, even in the
case of a film of a conventional clean superconductor of
microscopic thickness W, since Ty ~ Er(krW) > To,
universal 2D XY behavior is essentially unobservable.

3 One consequence of this is that close enough to Tz the physics
must universally crossover to 3D criticality, in which case L ~ €¢.

III. WHAT WOULD A BCS APPROACH TO
THE CUPRATES ENTAIL?

BCS approach to the overdoped cuprates

Because the cuprates are strongly correlated, the theo-
retical route from the microscopic physics of copper and
oxygen orbitals to an appropriate low energy effective
model is difficult and will not be addressed here. In-
stead, we assume that there exists an intermediate en-
ergy scale that is large compared to T.—possibly of or-
der the exchange energy in the parent antiferromagnetic
insulator, J + 1500 K [25]—below which the electronic
properties can be understood on the basis of an effective
model of well defined quasi-particles with relatively weak
residual interactions. The quasi-particle properties may
be strongly renormalized, and the residual interactions
can encode the effects of important high energy physics,
especially the existence of local moments on the copper
sites. Importantly, however, because the effective the-
ory is obtained by integrating out high energy degrees
of freedom, the residual interactions can be taken to be
short-ranged, and both the interactions and the quasi-
particle renormalizations must be smooth functions of
microscopic parameters, such as the doping concentra-
tion, p. The existence of quantum oscillations in some
overdoped cuprates, to be discussed in more detail later,
constitutes strong evidence that this assumption is rea-
sonable, at least at low temperatures.

The BCS self-consistency condition is derivable as an

implicit expression for the gap function, A(k) (which has
no explicit w dependence because we are dealing with
an effective Hamiltonian), as a function of the effective
interaction, V7"). This condition is usually expressed as
a convolution over momentum, ¢, of V(g), the Fourier
transform of V(7), and an integrand that depends on the

band dispersion, e(k) and the quasi-particle energy,

E(k) = V/le(B) — wl? +1A(R)P, (3)

where jy is the chemical potential. However, it is also
useful to look at this relation in real-space:

A) =-VF) 4), (4)

where (7) = (1/2)({ct. seh of hal} is the pair wave-

function,

. dk ger AB), | [BA %
a7) / Gn e 2B) tanh oT F [e( | ;

(5)
where F'(e) implements the necessary high energy cutoff
of the theory.

One feature of BCS theory that is often overlooked is
that the form of the gap function is almost entirely de-
termined by the form of the effective interaction. This
follows from Eq. 4 and the fact that ¢ is much longer
ranged (more slowly varying as a function of |r|) than
V. This explains why the gap function A(k) is typically
approximately momentum independent in conventional
superconductors. It also accounts for the fact that, al-
though the magnitude of A(k) changes with temperature
and vanishes at T., its Kk dependence remains roughly
constant—even in unconventional superconductors. For
the case of a d-wave SC, relevant to the cuprates,

A(k) = Ao a(h) f(&) (6)
where Ao characterizes the magnitude of the gap func-
tion, d(&) = (1/2)[cos(k») — cos(ky)] is mandated by the
d-wave symmetry, and f (k) (which determines the range
of A) transforms trivially under all point group transfor-
mations and is normalized so that f(0,7) = f(a,0) =

In the case of the shortest-range interactions allowed
by symmetry, f(R) = 1, corresponding to a gap func-
tion that is non-zero only on nearest-neighbor bonds. To
be explicit, we will treat the case of a density-density
interaction, U (r), and a spin-spin interaction (exchange

coupling), Ji (r), which vanish beyond nearest-neighbor
distance: U(r) = J(r) = 0 for r > 1. In this case,
whenever a non-zero Ao exists, the BCS self-consistency
relation can be written as

yp [2h ld}? pany | EO
17 | ee 2B(R) | aT

with V = — (34a) = 40(1)] . (Because we have assumed

F [| (7)

d-wave symmetry, the onsite interaction U (0) does not
play any role in pairing.) This equation applies only for
the case V < 0, and below T.. Note, that while we
consider it likely that the dominant contribution to V is
associated with incipient (short-range) antiferromagnetic
interactions (J(1) > 0), from the present perspective this
cannot be distinguished from the effects of a short-range
density-density attraction (U(1) < 0) that could arise
from interactions with appropriate high-energy optical
phonon modes. Eq. 7 is typically viewed from a bottom-
up perspective as a route to compute Ao(T) from a given
(assumed known) effective interaction; below, we will in-
vert this logic, and use measured values of A to infer the
nature of the effective interaction, V. .

Within BCS theory, T, vanishes only when V becomes
positive. Since the dependence of the effective parame-
ters on microscopic parameters is analytic by assumption,
in the present context this means that if there is (in the
absence of disorder) a critical value of the doping, Pmaz;
beyond which T’. vanishes, then

V = —Vo (Pmax ~ P) (8)

where Vo > 0. Consequently, T, ~ e~*@mez ~P)~" where
a x |1/Vo| is a dimensionless constant. In other words, if
the pairing interaction changes sign at a critical doping,

on

T. will decrease exponentially on approach to that dop-
ing, rather than cutting off sharply as it does at the edge
of a “dome”. This is the basis of the overdoped “tail”
shown in Figure 1.

Effects of disorder on a BCS d-wave superconductor

One might naively have thought that superconductiv-
ity in the weak coupling (BCS) limit would require ex-
tremely clean systems so that the mean-free-path, ¢, is
large compared to clean limit coherence length, . It is
a special property of conventional s-wave SC, known as

“Anderson’s theorem,” that both T, and Ao are largely
independent of €)/¢. Generically, disorder only signifi-
cantly affects T.. when it is strong, i.e. when krl~ 1.
However, it follows straightforwardly from the effective
field-theoretic approach of Abrikosov and Gorkov (AG)
that for d-wave and other superconductors with a sign-
changing gap, the pair-breaking effect of disorder results
in the elimination of the SC state when €o/¢ exceeds a
critical value of order 1. Indeed, there are some features
of the resulting theory that resemble observed properties
of overdoped cuprates.[20—28] For one thing, AG theory
gives an explicit expression for the way T, is suppressed
with increasing £o/¢ in which T,, vanishes linearly as & /¢
approaches the critical value. Moreover, the zero tem-
perature superfluid stiffness, «, vanishes in proportion to
T,. as T, + 0. However, this does not indicate that phase
fluctuations become important (and BCS theory there-
fore inaccurate). Specifically, in applying in Eq. 2 to 3D
materials, one expects the length scale, L ~, to be the c
axis coherence length, €.. Because & diverges as T, > 0,
it follows that Ty/T, also diverges. Even it we fix L =c,

To/Te ~ (kre) ~ (kr&) > 1asTe +0. (9)

As far as we know, accessing a regime in which Tg/T. < 1
requires something beyond BCS theory.

AG theory treats disorder in an effective medium ap-
proximation. This is expected to be extremely accurate
in the usual situation in which ) >> Lais, where Lais
is the correlation length of the disorder, a hierachy that
applies to many unconventional superconductors includ-
ing the iconic example of Sr2RuO4.[29] As is always the
case in the theory of disordered metals, there are effects
of “rare events” (for instance, regions with anomalously
large local density of states, and hence large values of the
local T..) that are not captured by any effective medium
theory. However, these occurrences are typically so rare
that they have little effect on measurable properties.

Even in the context of BCS mean-field theory, the
cuprates are special both in that they are d-wave and that
they have a relatively small coherence length, &) ~ 2 or 3
lattice constants. In particular, 9 is comparable to Luis,
which is likely at least of order p~!/? lattice constants; *

4 As has been stressed by Tranquada,['30)] the RMS variation of the
consequently, mesoscopic fluctuations in the local value
of £ inevitably lead to large variations in the local value
of T,. Therefore, near the edge of the SC dome the effects
of disorder are expected to be amplified, leading to an ef-
fectively granular state with locally SC puddles emersed
in a metallic background. Various numerical and ana-
lytic studies have confirmed this expectation.[8, 9, 31, 32]
Importantly, the inevitable consequence is a more rapid
suppression of Ty than of the spatially averaged T,.. Thus,
near the edge of the SC dome, phase fluctuations in-
evitably become important and lead to a breakdown of
the mean-field description.

IV. EXPERIMENTS ON OVERDOPED
CUPRATES

Here, we review a body of experimental evidence that
contains useful information concerning the applicabil-
ity of the BCS perspective in overdoped cuprates. We
summarize sets of experimental observations that most
clearly support the proposed perspective and then those
that are inconsistent with or apparently inconsistent with
it. In each case, we present arguments that features that
are inconsistent with the BCS perspective can be plau-
sibly understood as fluctuation effects arising from the
sort of inhomogeneous electronic structure expected for
a disordered d-wave SC with a short coherence length -
ie. that in the absence of disorder the features that are
inconsistent with BCS theory would be absent.

The body of experiments discussed here is necessar-
ily much smaller than the total corpus. 1) We focus
on experiments relevant to overdoped cuprates, and only
ouch on underdoped experiments where the comparison
is helpful. ° 2) We focus on what we consider to be the
“strongest” evidence: for example, we use quantum os-
cillations to argue for a Fermi liquid ground state rather
han power laws in various transport coefficients. 3) We
restrict our attention to “low energy” properties, that
is to say those that reflect excitations with energies less
han an intermediate scale which we take somewhat ar-
vitrarily to be ~ 0.1 eV, or in other words a scale of
order the exchange energy J in the undoped parent ma-
erials. 4) We focus on a subset of materials: YBCO, the
electronically cleanest cuprate; LSCO, the cuprate with
he most comprehensive data sets, including in the low-
emperature normal state accessed by magnetic fields;

dopant concentration in a region of size L is dp ~ \/p/L. More-
over, because the dopant atoms are generally removed from the
Cu-O plane, and affect the electronic structure in these planes
both through Coulomb interactions and induced strain, even if
the dopant positions are entirely uncorrelated the disorder poten-
tial is expected to have spatial correlations of substantial extent.
To further focus the discussion, we consider only hole-doped
cuprates. As mentioned below, the significant antiferromagnetic
correlations in the electron doped cuprates that persist to op-
timal doping and beyond, may complicate the present analysis
applied to these materials. For a review, see [3:3].

oa

T12201, the cleanest cuprate that can access the over-
loped regime; and Bi2212, which has the best angle-
resolved photoemission data.
One issue that arises when comparing results reported
in different studies on multiple families of cuprates is
that the doped hole concentration, p, is typically inferred
rather than measured. Indeed, often it is estimated on
the basis of an assumed universal form of the T,.(p) dome.
Especially since we will conclude that the termination of
the dome is highly sensitive to the character and nature
of the disorder, we have not adopted this approach. In-
stead, we adopt (wherever possible) the value obtained
from the area enclosed by the Fermi surface obtained
from low energy ARPES measurements or from quantum
oscillations.

The Fermi liquid ground state

Overdoped cuprates have quantum oscillations, angle-
dependent magnetoresistance, and ARPES that imply a
Fermi surface similar to what is found in LDA calcula-
tions.

Experiments in support of a Fermi liquid ground state.

Quantum oscillations (QOs)—arising due to Landau
quantization of quasparticle orbits in a magnetic field—
are the gold standard for demonstrating a Fermi liquid
ground state. At high enough magnetic fields to quench
superconductivity, QOs are observed in T12201 at dop-
ings higher than p = 0.27, corresponding to T’s < 26 K
[34, 35]. QOs are not observed for p < 0.27, possibly
due to the presence of 2D short-range correlated CDW
order, [36, 37] as discussed below.

Beyond the fact that there are QOs, which demon-
strates the presence of a Fermi surface, we also learn:

e There is a single, hole-like, cylindrical Fermi surface.
The measured areas correspond to hole densities of
p = 0.27 for T, = 26 K, p = 0.3 for T, = 10 K [34], re-
spectively, and are consistent with those inferred from
angle-dependent magnetoresistance [38], and ARPES
[39].

e The temperature dependence of the QOs fits the
Fermi-liquid “Lifshitz-Kosevich” form very well from
0.3 K to 3 K, yielding a cyclotron effective mass of ap-
proximately m* = 5m,, where m, is the bare electron
mass.

e The quasiparticle scattering rate is h/t = 2.4 meV.
(Note that this is the not the transport scattering
rate—QOs are sensitive to forward scattering processes
that do not affect the resistivity).

e The angle dependence of the quantum oscillations is
consistent with a g-factor of 2 [34], similar to under-

doped YBCO [10].
While the Fermi surface geometry agrees very well wit
LDA [41], a bandwidth renormalization of a factor of 3
is required to match the cyclotron mass with that cal
culated from LDA. This is similar to the mass renor-
malizations found in in SrgRuO, [12]. The same band-
width renormalization is found over hundreds of meV
y ARPES [13]. As pointed out by Rourke et al. [34],
his demonstrates that the quasiparticle mass renorma.
ization arises predominantly through eV-scale electron-
electron interactions, and not from interactions with a
low-energy boson. Moreover, interpreting the tempera-
ure dependence of the QO amplitude as an effective mass
assumes that corrections from an energy-dependent sel.
energy are small [14]. The absence of any deviation from
he standard LK form in T12201 implies that there are
no strongly energy-dependent renormalizations (as there
would be in the marginal Fermi liquid [15]), even with a
T, as high as 26 Kk.

Experiments challenging a Fermi liquid ground state.

The strongest arguments against a Fermi liquid ground
state stem from observations of various transport anoma-
lies at low T when SC is suppressed by a high magnetic
field. Of these, the most dramatic is the T-linear resis-
tivity extending to low temperatures in a range of doping
from pope to the OD edge of the SC dome, pmax. [18].
(Note that here we are not discussing the T-linear resis-
tivity extending to very high temperatures observed near
optimal doping that has long been argued to indicate the
existence of a non-Fermi-liquid ground state at or near a
special doping, p*.)

Specifically, Cooper et al. [18] report T-linear resistiv-
ity out to the very edge of the superconducting dome
in LSCO—when superconductivity disappears, so does
he T-linear resistivity. These measurements are consis-
ent with earlier observations in T12201 [19]. It has also
een suggested that the approximate correspondence be-
ween the ranges of p in which they are observed im-
lies that the scattering responsible for T-linear resistiv-
ity is also responsible for superconducting pairing. From
a somewhat different perspective, the observation of B-
inear magnetoresistance near optimal doping in LSCO
16], and later to higher dopings in T12201 and Bi2201
17], and has been interpreted as evidence for “scale in-
variance”, as might be expected near a quantum critical
oint.

Reconciling a Fermi liquid ground state.

There have been several theoretical proposals attempt-
ing to reconcile the unambiguous evidence from QO’s
for the existence of a FL with the observed transport
anomalies. On purely phenomenological grounds, a “two
fluid” model has been suggested,[17] although it is hard
to see how such behavior could arise other than from

some significant form of electronic inhomogeneity.[19] As
discussed above, even a high-quality, “uniformly doped”
sample will appear heterogeneous on short enough length
scales due to the statistical distribution of dopant loca-
tions. This can lead to an electronically inhomogeneous
state that consists of dilute superconducting “puddles”
that might survive even to the high fields at which SC
long-range coherence is destroyed; a recent paper[s] has
demonstrated that scattering from the quantum phase
fluctuations on such puddles can give rise to a T-linear
resistivity. Alternatively, the possibility that anoma-
lous scattering might be associated with local, nearly-
quantum-critical patches of some other order - possibly
associated with a disorder broadened antiferromagnetic
quantum critical point - has been proposed in a series of
related papers.[49-53]

For the present purposes, what is essential is that these
proposals imply that an extrinsic (disorder related) form
of anomalous scattering is responsible for the non-Fermi
liquid transport. Our specific prediction is that the T-
linear term will be absent in less disordered overdoped
cuprates, such as stoichiometric YBCO doped through
application of hydrostatic pressure [54].

Negligibility of superconducting fluctuations

When the phase ordering scale, Tg, is comparable to
T., phase fluctuations necessarily are an order-one effect;
this implies a breakdown of BCS mean-field theory. This
situation applies in all underdoped cuprates. The issue
is more complex in the overdoped cuprates.

Experimental evidence that fluctuations are insignificant

While in LSCO and T11201, the superfluid density (or
more precisely Ty) decreases with increasing p past opti-
mal doping (the “boomerang effect” illustrated in the in-
set of Fig. 1), in YBagCu3O, it increases monotonically
as a function of p across the entire accessible range of dop-
ing [55]. Particularly notable is the fact that Ty increases
by 50% from its value at p = 0.16, where T, = 94 K, to
p = 0.19, where T, = 88 K [56]. This departs markedly
from the Uemura relationship, where phase stiffness is
proportional to the superconducting Ty [14].

YBa2Cu3O7_5 does, in fact, exhibit an unambiguous
temperature range over which phase fluctuations are vis-
ible [57-60]. These experiments are consistent with 3D-
XY critical fluctuations [58, 60], extend to temperatures
of order 10% above T, at optimal doping (6 ~ 0.07),
and for a smaller range of T for overdoped YBazCu307
[57]. We conclude that phase fluctuations in overdoped
YBa2Cu3O7, while much larger than in conventional su-
perconductors (where the fluctuation regime is © 10-°T,
[24]), are not of primary importance for determining T,.

Experimental evidence of strong phase fluctuations

Mutual inductance measurements of the penetration
depth on thin-film LSCO [16], as well as ~SR measure-
ments of the same quantity on single-crystal T12201 [61],
show a vanishing superfluid phase stiffness approaching
the edge of the superconducting dome. Indeed, the ratio
of T/T behaves quite similarly on the underdoped and
overdoped sides of the SC dome.|(2] Large phase fluctu-
ations have also been inferred from the width and height
of the jump in specific heat at T, in T12201 [63], and from
the onset of an apparent diamagnetic signal in measure-
ments of the Nernst effect in overdoped LSCO, Bi2201,
and Bi2212 [(4, 65]. The implication of these experi-
ments in terms of phase fluctuations are in contradiction
with a BCS scenario.

Evidence that the large phase fluctuations are extrinsic

There are three classes of mechanisms that could
suppress the macroscopic phase stiffness of overdoped
cuprates relative to the bare Drude weight: i) intrinsic
strong-coupling physics, ii) pair-breaking due to scatter-
ing, and iii) mesoscopic inhomogeneity (on scales of order
he coherence length). All three may be present to some
degree, but we argue that the latter is dominant.”
Needless to say, macroscopic inhomogeneities in the
dopant concentration or crystal structure will inevitably
roduce electronic inhomogeneities on a similar scale.
This sort of inhomogeneity is thought to be a fea-
ure of strongly overdoped crystals of LSCO, where it
leads to an inhomogeneous (“Swiss cheese”) superfluid
response. [(i6, 67] ‘ But even in macroscopically homoge-
neous materials, we expect (as discussed above) that alloy
disorder will lead to spacial variations of the local elec-
ronic structure on more microscopic les. Direct evi-
dence of large amplitude local electronic inhomogeneity
comes from an analysis of the inhomogeneous broaden-
ing of the NQR spectra of various cuprates;[69, 70] with
wo exceptions, all cuprates studied exhibit a variance in
he local hole concentration measured on Cu sites that
is comparable to the total width of the superconducting
dome! This includes YBCO with O concentrations less
han 7. The two exceptions, in which the NQR linewidth

© In Refs. [26-28], the authors argue that many salient features of
the overdoped cuprates can be accounted for entirely on the basis
of the pair-breaking effects of disorder, without considerations of
disorder-induced inhomogeneous gap structures or phase fluctu-
ations. While this analysis is consistent with our view of the
“ideal” overdoped cuprate, it is not easily reconciled with the
strong direct and indirect evidence of large amplitude gap inho-
mogeneities, nor with the fact that Ty ~ T- implies that phase
fluctuations are significant.

7 Evidence that the superfluid response of Tl-2201 is inhomoge-
neous on a few hundred A scale has also been adduced in Ref.
[68].

is more than an order of magnitude smaller, are the sto-
ichometric compounds, YBCO7 and YBCO-248.
Turning to direct evidence of an inhomogeneous SC
gap: superconducting puddles have been visualized by
STM in overdoped BSCCO[71-75]. At p = 0.19, super-
conducting gaps persist up to 120 kelvin or more in local
regions with radii of a few tens of angstroms. A similar
temperature scale characterizing the onset of some form
of local SC correlations has been inferred from analysis
of the Nernst effect and magnetization. [65] ARPES mea-
surements on the same material show a particle-hole sym-
metric (so presumably superconducting) gap that opens
at an imprecisely defined crossover temperature that re-
mains of order 50% above T, for T; as low as 70 K.[76-79]
Concerning bulk measurements: Wang et al. [80]
clearly established the existence of a VH dependence
of the specific heat down to fields at least as low as
HoH = 0.5 T in OD LSCO at x = 0.24 (T, = 20 K).
This “Volovik effect” arises due to the Doppler shift of
nodal quasiparticles; when pair breaking produces more
nodal quasiparticles, the ¥/H-dependence crosses over to
H-linear for H less than a field scale proportional to the
normal-state scattering rate [81]. In the same a = 0.24
sample, Wang et al. [80] also show that the residual
T — 0 value of the Sommerfeld coefiscient, C/T, in a
number of OD crystals of LSCO with various values of
p is more than half of its normal state value at T > Ty.
To obtain such a large residual C/T from conventional
sheories of pair breaking would require a normal-state
scattering rate of order AT = 1 meV. But this same scat-
ering rate would produce H-linear specific heat below
approximately 4 T, which is clearly at odds with the
observation of C/T « WH down to 0.5 T. To recon-
cile these observations,Wang et al. [80] suggested that
he sample is heterogenous at these dopings, with rel-
atively clean regions that become superconducting and
show C/T x WH, and non-superconducting regions that
account for the residual specific heat. As outlined above,
his proposal is likely broadly consistent with theoreti-
cal expectations for a d-wave SC with a short coherence
length in the presence of randomly distributed dopant
atoms. It is worth noting that a similarly large uncon-
densed fraction of quasiparticles are also present in the
specific heat of OD T12201: by T. = 30 K, the jump in
C/T at T, is only 10% of the residual C/T as T > 0 [63].
Further bulk evidence of strongly electronically inho-
mogeneous states produced by alloy disorder in LSCO is
discussed in Refs. [82] and [30].
YBa2Cu3O7 stands alone as a material that becomes
more homogeneous as it is doped from optimal to over-
doped [83, 84], due to its particular mechanism of dop-
ing through copper-oxide chains. Where T12201, LSCO,
BSCCO, and even Ca-doped YBCO generally have phase
stiffnesses that decrease when moving from optimal dop-
ing to overdoped, YBa2Cu30O7’s phase stiffness increases
substantially (see Figure 2). Our specific prediction is
that YBa2Cu3O7 doped further using pressure or uniax-
ial strain would show a continued rise in superfluid phase

Finally, we note that there are reasons to believe that
the small values of Ty seen in underdoped cuprates re-
flect distinct, more likely intrinsic physics than in the
overdoped *. Specifically, there is independent evidence
that not only Ty, but more generally the density of mobile
charges drops with underdoping. For instance, the Drude
weight, D, obtained by integrating the normal state opti-
cal conductivity up to frequencies of several hundred meV
drops on the underdoped side upon approach to the Mott
insuating state, while it remains large upon approaching
the overdoped side of the SC dome; on the underdoped
side the fraction of the mobile carriers that condense in
the SC state (~ Tj/D) remains nearly constant, while on
the overdoped side, the drop in Ty is associated with a
decreasing fraction that condense.

8 This does not imply that disorder plays no role in the behavior of
the underdoepd material - but it does suggest that an underlying
piece of strong-correlation physics is the primary driver of the
small values of Tp.

The weak-coupling magnitude of the
superconducting gap

Weak-coupling BCS theory makes a specific prediction
for the ratio of the superconducting gap to the critical
temperature. For a d-wave superconductor, this ratio de-
pends weakly on band-structure details, of which a typi-
cal value is A/kgT,, = 2.14 [85].

Experimental evidence for a weak-coupling gap

ARPES and STM measurements of the superconduct-
ing gap in BSSCO show that A/kgT~ can be as large as
8 in the underdoped regime [71, 86]. This is indicative
either of strong coupling, or of the difficult in separating
the pseudogap from the superconducting gap. However,
even if only the near-nodal gap[&6] is assumed to be the
direct consequence of pairing, this ratio grows with un-
derdoping and reaches values in excess of 4. We will
return to this later when discussing the shape of the d-
wave gap in momentum space, but for now is enough to
say that underdoped cuprates clearly do not follow the
simple weak-coupling prediction for the size of the gap.

As BSSCO is hole doped past optimal doping, how-
ever, both STM and ARPES find that the gap decreases
rapidly and the Ao/T, ratio approaches 2 (within sub-
stantial error bars) by p = 0.24 [71, 79]. Further, while
STM still shows a broad distribution of gap sizes, and
correspondingly some local regions in which a gap per-
sist to temperatures well above T., the mean value of
Ao/2 and the typical temperature at which the local gap
vanishes both approach T, for p 2 0.24. All of these
observations suggest that the strength of the supercon-
ducting gap in overdoped cuprates is roughly consistent
with weak-coupling BCS theory.

Non-mean-field behavior of the gap

The persistence of superconducting gaps above T,—
seen in both STM and ARPES—is inconsistent with the
BCS mean-field assumption. However, as already dis-
cussed, it is natural to assign this to the intrinsic ampli-
fication of the effects of mesoscopic variations in the local
environment expected in a d-wave superconductor with
relatively short coherence length.

Absence of intertwined orders

A central feature of the cuprate phase diagram is
the presence of multiple intertwined phases that all oc-
cur with comparable energy scales—antiferromagnetism,
spin glass, charge density wave, and d-wave supercon-
ductivity all appear at the few-tens-of-kelvin to a couple
hundred kelvin scale [87]. (If the pseudo-gap can be asso-

”

ciated with some other form of “hidden order,” [6] then it,

too, must be characterized by this same general energy
scale.) The lack of separation of energy scales makes it
impossible to cleanly treat any single order parameter in
isolation [7, 88].

Absence of intertwined orders in overdoped cuprates

The situation is greatly simplified in the overdoped

regime. There, the various non-superconducting orders
clearly weaken and plausibly disappear beyond a doping
that depends on the particular order under considera-
tion, as well as on the particular cuprate. For exam-
le, charge density wave order (with correlation lengths
Ecaw S 200A) are present in T12201 up to p = 0.25, but
are absent at p= 0.26 and above. This is apparent from
oth resonant inlelastic X-ray scattering at p = 0.25 and
p = 0.26 [36], as well as from the absence of Fermi sur-
face reconstruction in quantum oscillation experiments
at higher dopings [34].
Likewise in YBCO, long-range antiferromagnetism is
absent above p = 0.05, and short-range spin glass corre-
ations are absent above p = 0.10. Above that doping, a
gap opens in the spin excitation spectrum seen in neu-
ron scattering [89]. For fully doped YBCO (p = 0.19),
he gap in the spin excitation spectrum is of order 40
meV [0], implying that static spin structures (i.e. anti-
ferromagnetism and related orders) and low-energy spin
excitations are not relevant at these dopings. No spin
order—either short or long range—has been reported in
T12201.

Evidence of intertwined orders in overdoped cuprates

While there is no doubt the various forms of SDW and
CDW stripe order seen in LSCO are strongest in un-
derdoped LSCO, with increasingly careful studies it has
become clear that weak correlations - but with much the
same stripe structure - persist deep into the overdoped
range of p, and possibly to the edge of the SC dome.
However, careful analysis[82] strongly suggests that this
order exists in the form of strongly correlated striped
patches in an otherwise metallic matrix. This observa-
tion, in turn, likely reflects a similar sort of correlation
enhanced amplification of the effects of otherwise innocu-
ous mesoscopic variations in the local environment - the
density-wave analogue of explanation offered for the ex-
istence of SC puddles.

Vv. CONCERNING THE “MECHANISM”

Once we accept the validity of the BCS perspective
in the overdoped cuprates, we can work backwards from
observations of the gap function to draw incomplete but
clear inferences concerning the nature of the interactions
responsible for the pairing. To be concrete, we focus on

10

the ARPES results on Bi2212, where good tight-binding
fits to the electronic dispersion have been obtained and
for which the cleanest measurements of the supercon-
ducting gap are available.

For doping concentrations ranging from slightly under-
doped to the highest level of overdoping for which data
exists, and within the error bars, the k dependence of
the T — 0 gap function on the Fermi surface is simply
given by d(k) = (1/2) [cos ky — cos ky] - ie. f (|) 1 in
Eq. 6. As discussed in section Il, this implies that the
pairing interaction is short-ranged - primarily on nearest-
neighbors. ’ Inverting Eq. 6, we can determine the mag-
nitude of the pairing interaction from an empirical fit to
the measured dispersion and the gap function. For the
relevant range of dopings, the ARPES dispersion is well
fit by

e(k) 2t[cos(k,) + cos(ky)] — 4t’ cos(k,) cos(ky)
— 2t"(cos(2k,) + cos(2k,)], (10)

with t = 166 meV, t/ = —0.33¢ and t” = 0 [91], and
with a bilayer splitting of the form —2t 2(k) witht, =
0.21¢ [92]. The measured values of the gap (averaged over
the bonding and anti-bonding bands) and the value we
extract for the pairing strength, V, are shown in Fig. 3.

Inferences from analyzing A(k)

e The magnitude of the pairing interaction at optimal
doping, V ~ 0.6 eV, is of the expected magnitude if
one further assumes that it derives primarily from lo-
cal exchange interactions. Specifically, it is well known
that to next to leading order in the large U = U(0)
expansion of the pure Hubbard model, one gener-
ates an effective nearest-neighbor J = J(1) = 4t?/U
and U(1) = —tJ. For the inferred value of V =
3J(1) - 4U (1) = 4J, this corresponds to J © 0.15eV,
in reasonable agreement|{)3] with values inferred in un-
doped antiferromagnet cuprates. |{)4|

e To the extent that J is an extension of the local physics
of the undoped antiferromagnet, one would expect it
to decrease with large enough doping. The smooth but
none-the-less pronounced decrease of V with increasing
p thus provides additional suggestive evidence that it
is largely magnetic in origin. Comparing this expecta-
tion with direct probes of the doping dependence of the
magnetic fluctuations is somewhat complicated. X-ray
measurements[95—97] suggest that there is relatively
little decrease in the strength of the magnetic fluctua-
tions over much of the Brillouin zone (especially near

° It is much harder to constrain the frequency dependence of the
gap function without a better understanding of the full spectral
function.

Q= (z,0)). However, neutron scattering[82, 98, 99]
studies have found that in the important[1()()] range of
(4) near (7,7), there is indeed a pronounced drop in
magnetic intensity with overdoping.

The fact that the measured k-dependence of the gap
is well approximated by d(k) implies that the effec-
ive interaction remains short-range as low as optimal
doping. This precludes any theory that identifies opti-
mal doping with the point at which the pairing arises
primarily from the exchange of any familiar quantum-
critical collective mode. (Note, this does not imply
hat there are no quantum critical points under the
superconducting dome - given the plethora of inter-
‘wined orders, such quantum critical points may well
arise in some circumstances.'” However, to the extent
that A(k) o d(k), we conclude that no quatum critical
mode is the prime driver of superconductivity.)

From this perspective, it is interesting to compare the
k-dependence of the gap in the hole-doped cuprates
with the corresponding (not nearly as well docu-
mented) behavior of the electron-doped cuprates. In
the electron doped materials, even at optimal doping
there is direct evidence of antiferromagnetic fluctua-
tions with a correlation length large compared to one
lattice constant. To the extent that these fluctuations
play a significant role in the pairing interaction, one
would expect this to lead to a much more structured
A(k). Indeed, suggestive evidence of a non-monotonic
dependence of the gap along the Fermi surface has been
observed - see Ref. [33] for a review.

Additional Considerations

It is important to acknowledge that, at short-distances
and high energy scales, it follows from the low electron
density (large value of r;) that the cuprates are more
strongly interacting than conventional metals. The
above treatment of the mechanism of SC in overdoped
cuprates does not contradict this observation. The es-
sential assumption we are making is that when high en-
ergy degrees of freedom are integrated out, the quasi-
particles in the resulting low-energy effective Hamil-
tonian are sufficiently weakly interacting for a Fermi-
liquid description to be possible; both the parameters
that characterize the quasi-particle dispersion relation
in Eq. 10 and the effective pairing interaction, V,
should thus be interpreted as effective parameters.

For instance, the observation[!(!] of an apparently divergent
electron effective mass seen in quantum oscillations in YBCO
as p approach a critical value ~ pop: is strong evidence of the
existence of a quantum critical point in the “normal” state ob-
tained when superconductivity is quenched with a high magnetic
field.

data for Bi2212 (from [79]): The yellow points are the mea-
sured values of Ao and the blue dots are the expected BCS
magnitude of Ap = 2.14kgT. for the measured T.. The red
points are the values of the pairing interaction, v, obtained
by inverting Eq. 7 using the measured values of Ao and of the
normal-state dispersion. The grey and red lines are simple fits
to the existing data that allow it to be smoothly extrapolated
to higher values of doping, for which no data exists. The pur-
ple dots are the values of Ao that would result from values
of V on the red line. The inset is a blow-up of the range of
doping near the critical point at which the extrapolated Vv
would change sign.

e One can legitimately question the self-consistency of
this analysis, given that we have obtained values of
the pairing interaction, V, that are not small, i.e
V p(Er) ~ 1 at optimal doping, dropping to Vp(Er) ~
0.5 at the highest doping we analyze in Figure 3. How-
ever, the same can be said of the Migdal-Eliashberg
treatment of conventional SCs such as Pb, where
in fact the dimensionless strength of the electron-
pohonon coupling, A ~ 1[102].

VI. FALSIFIABLE CONSEQUENCES

While it is not possible to have a disorder-free mate-
rial, it is possible to identify circumstances in which the
amount of disorder is significantly suppressed. The prin-
cipal empirical test of the perspective presented here is
that deviations from the predictions of Fermi liquid the-
ory for the low energy properties of the normal state, and
of BCS mean-field theory for the superconducting state,
should tend to be decreasingly pronounced in overdoped
cuprates the weaker the disorder. Below, we list some of
the experimental properties that could serve as particu-
larly good indicators of such trends, and where possible,
we mention some existing data that constitutes encour-
aging evidence of the expected tendencies.

e The linear drop of T; ~ (pmax — p) to zero at a critical
doping Pmax should get increasingly rounded (convex)
and Pmaz is likely to increase (see Figure 3). The fact

that T. persists up to at least p = 0.31 in T12201 [34],
compared to p = 0.27 in the comparatively more dis-
ordered LSCO, is suggestive of this, but a finer doping
dependence is needed

The superfluid density should grow to be an increas-
ingly large fraction of the total Drude weight. Specif-
ically, one should observe an increasing tendency to-
ward the edge of the SC dome to realize the famil-
iar situation in which Ty >> T,. The data in slightly-
overdoped YBazCu3O, is suggestive that this may be
the case in the cleanest cuprates, but higher dopings
are needed.

The zero temperature gap function should approach
the BCS value in magnitude, Ap ~ 2T,. Moreover,
spectroscopic evidence for a gap that persists for T >
T., or beyond the end of the superconducting dome,
P > Pmazx, should occur over decreasing ranges of T
and p. The existing data in Bi2212 is suggestive that
this is the case (see Figure 3), but higher dopings are
needed.

The specific heat should show increasingly clear mean-
field features with decreasing disorder, including a
mean-field jump in the specific heat at T and a strong
supression of the residual C/T in the T — 0 limit.
There should be a similar drop in the residual Drude
response seen in terahertz optical conducitivity for
w<ApgandT <T..

11 Tt is also observed that in multi-layer cuprates, the outer-planes

screen the disorder intrinsic to the charge-reservoir layers, mean-
ing that disorder effects are reduced on the inner planes. Un-
fortunately, for present purposes, the inner layers tend to be
underdoped - often so much so that they exhibit long-range an-
tiferromagnetic order coexisting with the superconductivity (i.e.
it is a distinct phase of matter).

12

e The T-linear term in the resistivity seen in overdoped
materials when superconductivity is suppressed with a
magnetic field should become increasingly small with
decreasing disorder.

YBazCu307 is somewhat overdoped and is stoichio-
metric, meaning that intrinsic alloy disorder is absent; in-
deed, various experimental probes appear to corroborate
the expectation that available samples of YBa2Cu307
are tangibly less electronically inhomogeneous than other
overdoped materials. For the future, it seems that the
doped hole concentration in the Cu-O planes of this ma-
terial can be increased with application of pressure, so

this may be the ideal material to test the present ideas.
