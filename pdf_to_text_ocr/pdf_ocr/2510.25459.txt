We study vorticity-induced effects arising from the Wess-Zumino- Witten terms for
Nambu-Goldstone modes in chiral perturbation theory. We first provide an alterna-
ive derivation of the Wess-Zumino-Witten terms in the presence of external vector,
axial-vector, and pseudoscalar fields using a derivative expansion of the fermion de-
erminant. We then employ the previously found correspondence in which vorticity
is treated as an axial-vector field coupled to Dirac fermions in flat spacetime. Using

his, we derive vorticity-induced contributions for Nambu-Goldstone modes in the

presence of electromagnetic fields at finite baryon and isospin chemical potentials,
including a vorticity-induced current, a magnetic-field-induced angular momentum,
and a vorticity-modified photon-pion coupling. We also briefly discuss the phe-

nomenological implications of these vorticity-induced effects.

I. INTRODUCTION

Quantum anomalies are among the ways that quantum physics deviates from our classical
expectations of nature. A well-known example is the chiral anomaly, where the axial-vector
current is no longer conserved once we quantize the classical field theory. This has significant
physical consequences, such as contributing to the width of the neutral pion decay into two
photons [1] 2]. Since this anomaly is tied to the topological nature of the theory and does not
depend on the energy scale, it provides nonperturbative constraints on low-energy physics,
known as the ’t Hooft anomaly matching condition [3].

The non-conservation of a non-Abelian axial-vector current in the presence of external

fields was first derived by Bardeen [4], where the divergences of the vector and axial-vector

fields are written in a form such that the vector current is conserved. Bardeen’s form of the
anomaly was later shown to obey certain consistency conditions by Wess and Zumino [5],
which led to it being called the consistent form of the anomaly. This differentiates it from the
covariant anomaly, where both vector and axial-vector currents transform covariantly but
neither are conserved in general [6]. Wess and Zumino also described some of the low-energy
manifestations of the chiral anomaly, including the effective action for Nambu-Goldstone
(NG) modes including the K+K~ + a+a~7® interaction [5]. This was later extended by
Witten [7], who showed the anomalous effective action in the absence of external fields can
be written as an integral over five spacetime dimensions, now known as the Wess-Zumino-
Witten (WZW) term. Shortly after, the full WZW effective action in the presence of external
fields was explicitly determined [8}{14].

Since these seminal works, the WZW terms have found numerous applications, including
their effects on finite-density QCD matter under strong magnetic fields and/or rota-
tion [18] [19], in connection with the chiral magnetic effect (CME) [20}23] and chiral vortical
effect (CVE) [2427]. The presence of the WZW terms reveals novel QCD phase structures,
such as the pion domain wall [16], chiral soliton lattice (CSL) [I7], baryon crystal [28] [29],
and domain-wall Skyrmion phases [30] in magnetic fields. Analogous phase structures have
also been discussed in rotating systems [18] [31H33]. On the other hand, WZW terms involv-
ing rotation or vorticity themselves remain less well explored, apart from Refs. [18] [19]. For
example, the so-called helical magnetic effect (HME) [34] [35], which is a current along the
magnetic field in the presence of fluid helicity, is known to be related to the anomaly
and is expected to satisfy anomaly matching. Nevertheless, the corresponding low-energy
effective theory has not yet been formulated. In this work, while not addressing the HME it-
self, we derive previously unexplored vorticity-induced effects within the framework of chiral
perturbation theory (ChPT) for NG modes.

From a phenomenological viewpoint, these vorticity-induced effects may be relevant to
relativistic heavy ion collisions, where the strong vorticity is extracted from measurements of
global spin polarization of A hyperons in noncentral collisions [37]. There have been exten-
sive theoretical studies of QCD matter under rotation, ranging from fundamental properties
such as the QCD phase transition [38}43] to heavy-ion phenomenology, such as thermal
dilepton emission [44}|46]. However, most of these studies focus on the deconfined phase,

effective theories with quark degrees of freedom, or phenomenological models. Meanwhile,
the vorticity may remain strong even in the hadronic phase as suggested by the enhanced
hyperon polarization in low-energy heavy ion collisions [47] [48]. It is hence important to es-
tablish, from first principles, the low-energy effective action with hadronic degrees of freedom
under rotation.

In this paper, we first present an alternative derivation of the WZW terms in the presence
of external vector, axial-vector, and pseudoscalar fields using a derivative expansion of the
fermion determinant following the method of Ref. [49]. We then employ the correspondence
found in Ref. [36], whereby vorticity is treated as an axial-vector field coupled to Dirac
fermions in flat spacetime. On this basis, we derive vorticity-induced contributions for NG
modes in the presence of electromagnetic fields at finite baryon and isospin chemical po-
tentials, including a vorticity-induced current, a magnetic-field-induced angular momentum,
and a vorticity-modified photon—pion coupling. Although we use the linear sigma model as
the underlying microscopic theory, our results should be model-independent.

This work is structured as follows. First, we introduce our linear sigma model in Sec. (0
and outline the derivative expansion of fermion determinants. We then construct the effec-
tive action in Sec. and compare with the already established results. We explore some
consequences of these terms in Sec. In Sec.|[V} we summarize our results and provide fur-
ther discussion. We work in natural units h = c = 1 and use the conventions for the metric

tensor 7),, = diag(1,—1,—1,—1) and totally anti-symmetric tensor <4”? with €°!3 = 1.

II. LINEAR SIGMA MODEL AND DERIVATIVE EXPANSION OF FERMION
DETERMINANTS

Our starting point is the linear sigma model Lagrangian
L=6(id-V +7A-me™) vs, (1)

where w is the Dirac spinor field with fermion mass m, and Ny flavor and N, color degrees
of freedom. Here, V,, and A, are respectively the external vector and axial-vector fields.
We use “slash” notation, A = 7A, and 7° = i7°y!y773. This is identical to the starting
point of Ref. [86] except we have introduced the pseudoscalar fields 6 following Ref. [49]
to examine the low-energy physics. As it stands, we can accommodate local, non-Abelian

vector and axial-vector symmetries provided that the pseudoscalar fields also transform in
an appropriate manner. Our initial results will be relevant for such cases. However, we will
eventually be interested in Abelian fields only, especially when A,, can be interpreted as the

vorticity. Thus, we can think of the local transformation
WoePOry, A, >A,+GA, b> O+42A, (2)

under which our Lagrangian is invariant when 6 = @¢, which could be interpreted as a

flavor-singlet field. To allow for additional pseudoscalar mesons, we take

6=I1+¢, (3)

where Hl = mT. /f, is the SU(Ny) pseudoscalar field which does not transform under the
local U(1) axial symmetry (2). Here, T, (a = 1,2,--- ,N7—1) are the generators of SU(N)
and f, is the pion decay constant.

To determine the WZW terms from Eq. (i), we employ the derivative expansion method
of Ref. [49]. Our partition function is

Z= / Dw Dy exp {if d‘x [¥ (id —V+7A- me’) u| \ ; (4)

and we can integrate out fermions to obtain the effective action

T =-itrin E V+7A me], (5)

with momentum operator p,. Here, “tr” denotes the functional trace over the implicit
spacetime indices, and the internal spaces, like flavor, color, and Dirac space. From here,

we would like to extract the effective Lagrangian Leg via

[= / d*e Leg - (6)

This can be achieved to a certain order in the external fields and their derivatives by ex-
panding around V,, = A, = @ = 0, such that
1 -~ 1

LY
T= —itrIn (p— m) +itr mill + 5M + (7)

where M = V— yA+m(ei” —1). To place the above effective action in the form of Eq. (6).
we can use the relation

d‘p
(27)

trP& = / de Tr(2|P2|2) = / / de Tr P(p)X(2), (8)
where P and & are operators with eigenvalues P(p) and ¥(x) respectively. The trace “Tr”
is no longer over spacetime indices but over the internal spaces only. Before applying this
relation, we would first need to separate the position and momentum operators. To do this,

we use the commutation relations

[p*, y] = id"y, (9)
and
1 1 2 1 272.
E Pe =| (p2 — m2)? [p*, e] + (p2 — m2)3 [P*, [p 5] doses (10)
(see, e.g., Ref. [50) for a proof) with
[p?, y] = 0,0" + 2ip"O,0 - (11)

After this, one can perform the momentum integral in Eq. and obtain the result in the

form of Eq. (6). where the explicit expression of Lg will be given in Sec.

Ill. WZW EFFECTIVE ACTION WITH EXTERNAL FIELDS

In this section, we present the results of the derivative expansion up to fourth order in the
external fields V,,, A,, and 9. This leaves many terms to be computed from the expansion
(7. The WZW terms are proportional to e“”°? and one can use this fact to determine which
terms will contribute to the effective action. In essence, we only need to consider terms
where the total number of A, and @ fields is odd. This follows from the standard Dirac-
trace identity, Trp yyy" 27> = —4iet”?. We note that even after applying this selection
rule, some terms will still end up vanishing. We do not discuss such terms further. In the
following, we also omit the details of each calculation. Interested readers are provided details
of one of the calculations in Appendix|A]and are referred to Ref. [49] for further information.
The first nonvanishing terms emerge at third order in the fields. These are the terms with
one 6 and two V, or A,. As a shorthand, we label theses terms 6VV and @AA respectively.
We will employ similar shorthands below when referring to pieces of the effective action.

The 6VV term comes from considering

1 g 1 1
itr imy’é ;

in the expansion (7). where we have expanded exp (i97°) in M for small @ as in Ref. [49]. We
have included all terms which are equivalent under the cyclicity of the trace in the above,
whose addition cancels the factor of 1/3. After collecting the momentum operators together

and performing the momentum integrals, we obtain the effective action
1 é
Fees ae / d*x Tr 0,,00,VaV~p , (13)

up to second order in derivatives. This was previously derived in Ref. [49] for the case with
electromagnetic fields and SU(Ns) pseudoscalar field. The 6AA contribution comes from
the equivalent term in Eq. with both V,, replaced by —7°A,,. We find

Dosa etvoB / d‘x Tr 0,00, AAs , (14)

up to second order in derivatives.

yielding

up to third order in derivatives. This was also obtained in Ref. [49] for the case with
electromagnetic fields and SU(Nf) pseudoscalar field. By expanding terms similar to Eq.
but with two of the im@y° factors replaced by V, we find the OVVV effective action

Tevvy = wn / d4x Tr (O,0ViVa + OVLOnVa) Va , (17)

up to third order in derivatives.

Also, the 69V A contribution arises not only from the fourth-order terms

After simplification, the resulting effective action is

+07(0,Va, a,Asl)
up to first order in derivatives. Because this is one of the most involved calculation and the
result plays a key role in the applications discussed in the next section, we provide some
computational details in Appendix [A]
Finally, the @V AA contribution is also nonzero. Similar to the effective action (20), these
come from the terms where one of the —7°A factors is replaced by imy°@. This piece

of the effective action reads

Collecting all terms, the WZW effective action up to fourth order in V,,, A, and @ is

+ 2[8,,0, 0}{0,Va, Ag} + 2(0,00,Va9 — 00,Va9,0) Ag
+ 8°[0,Vas wApl) +.

In the above, we have performed the color trace, leaving only the flavor trace Try. Our
result completely agrees with the full non-Abelian anomaly commonly used in ChPT [5I}-
[54]. Typically, this effective action is written in terms of differential forms of the left- and

right-handed gauge fields and field U = exp (—i@). It is uncommon to express the WZW term
directly in terms of the vector, axial-vector fields and pseudoscalar fields (see Refs. [53] (55) [56]
for other examples). The general expression above thus serves as a useful compact form of
the full effective action, particularly in contexts where the vector and axial-vector variables
are more convenient.

For our purposes, we specialize to the case of an Abelian vector or axial-vector gauge
field obeying the transformation and decompose @ according to Eq. (3). To this end, let
us change notation to V, > eQve with charge matrix @ in analogy to electromagnetism.

The effective action then reduces to

(23)
— 520, (I+ 4) A,Ta.tIV? + [Q[d,t1, Wave Ay}

By looking at the variation of the above under the axial transformation Q), we can find the

divergence of the axial current j4. To be specific, we use

dal = / d'2d,Aj4 = — / d*tr0,.54 (24)
where 6,4 denotes the variation under the axial transformation Q), to find

Ny

where the field strength tensor for V,@ is defined as FY, = 0,,V,2 — 0,V, and likewise for the
A, field strength tensor F’ an This matches what one might expect from the Abelian version
of the Bardeen anomaly in Ref. [4].

Up to this point, we have not specified the vector gauge transformation under which our
Lagrangian is invariant. Using the same substitution V,, = eQV,e for an Abelain vector

field and the decomposition (3). it is invariant under the infinitesimal transformation

> (1—iexQ)v, Vie + V2 + Ox, II > I + iex{I, Q]. (26)

Under this transformation, the variation of the effective action is nonzero. In other
words, the equivalent of Eq. for transformation is nonzero. However, this variation
is fourth order in the fields. We expect the vector current jo to be one order lower in the
fields than our effective action (i.e., third order). As such, the higher-order contribution to

the divergence of Jo can be ignored for our purposes. Furthermore, one can confirm this
variation is cancelled by terms appearing if 'wzw were extended to one order higher in the
external fields. Since such terms are beyond the scope of this work, we do not include them
here. It suffices to note that the full effective action is vector gauge invariant up to at least
fourth order in the external fields. Thus, we conclude that up to the order of interest, the

vector current jo is conserved and the consistent anomaly is reproduced.

IV. PIONS WITH VORTICITY, ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS, AND
CHEMICAL POTENTIALS

Here, we shall discuss some of the physical applications of our effective action for Ny = 2.
Before discussing the vortical effects brought about by A,, we first focus on the relevance
of our results when both A, and ¢ are absent. Without these fields, we retrieve the usual
anomalous coupling between pseudoscalar mesons and electromagnetic fields [5} [7] [57], in-
cluding the one which contributes to the neutral pion decay to two photons [I] 2].

In addition, there are anomalous terms which emerge in the presence of background

chemical potentials. For this purpose, we also add the term

Lext = Dey upvy ’ (27)

to our Lagrangian (OR where jf is the chemical potential associated with flavor f. By pro-
moting the chemical potentials to U(1) vector fields, we can essentially make the substitution
Vi = QVC +V,2/N.+73V,] /2 in the effective action (22), where V,? and V,/ are the baryon
and isospin gauge fields, respectively, Q = diag(2/3, —1/3) is the charge matrix, and 7, are
Pauli matrices. After carrying out the flavor and color traces, we obtain the following terms

in the effective action for N, = 3:

e 2
Top +lranB “af, ehvas / dx (anor + gzatomdvrode Oar) Ve ; (28a)
e va é
Prat =TEq7 Fe ° / dx OymoF RVG (28b)

where one can eventually set V,? = (42,0) and VJ = (11,0) as in Ref. [15]. The effective
Lagrangian extracted from Eq. is essentially VP Jew, Where jéyy is a baryon Goldstone-
Wilczek current [7 [57]. This is the same lowest-order term in 7, derived in Refs. [15] [16],
which was used to obtain the pion domain wall [16], and was later generalized to the CSL

phase [17] in QCD at finite jzg in a magnetic field. The effective Lagrangian extracted from
10

Eq. yields the analogous term for the isospin CSL [58} [59]. Our results demonstrate
that all these terms can be derived explicitly from the linear sigma model.

We now include a constant vorticity w” = ¢”°*8u,0,ug/2 with uM being four-velocity.
Applying the identification of the vorticity as an emergent axial gauge field A, = w,/2
[36], together with the observation that the axial current j°4 = Wy°7"w can be interpreted
as the spin polarization, the term involving A, corresponds to the spin-vorticity coupling
j°"w,,/2 in Lorentz covariant form. In such a case, the last term in Eq. for SU(2) flavor

symmetry leads to an effective action,

e

PinQu = — ion p hve / d4z (20,01 — MOyT2) FO wg (29)

which couples the electromagnetic gauge field and pion fields to a background vorticity. This

term accounts for an anomalous current and angular momentum density:

where

is the non-anomalous isospin current carried by charged pions with m+ = (a im2)/V2 from
the lowest-order Lagrangian in ChPT (see, e.g., Ref. |54]). This is one of our main results.
In particular, the temporal component of Eq. (30a) and spatial component of Eq. (30b) are

given by

i _

n= impo (Wat x Vr), (32a)

J= Bre (32b)

respectively, where n; = j? is the non-anomalous isospin charge. The former is the anoma-
lous charge carried by pions under the presence of vorticity. The latter is the anomalous
angular momentum carried by pions in the presence of the magnetic field B, which can be
viewed as a cross-correlated response between vorticity and magnetic field; see also Ref. [18]

for a similar cross-correlation.

Combining with the lowest-order Lagrangian for the electromagnetic interaction term in

ChPT, we have the vorticity-modified photon-pion coupling

Lise) = ieVeH (m+n —7 Ont — a ‘ (33)

Such an effective interaction is expected to modify the current-current correlators associated
with the photon and dilepton production in a pion gas at finite temperature and/or density.
Furthermore, we can consider the additional effective action with constant vorticity in-

volving V;/-:

V2,Vi,0, = O(p') in ChPT, and are thus subleading. Even so, they are unique in that
they couple electromagnetic fields and/or jz; with vorticity to charged pions. Therefore, they
may be relevant for discussions of charged pion condensation in systems with large rotation,
magnetic fields, and/or jy, such as heavy ion collisions. In particular, there has been interest
in the condensation of charged pions under rotation in a magnetic field [60H63]. The Dera.
term would affect the dispersion relation of the charged pions, leading to a correction to the

effective chemical—potential threshold for condensation.

V. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

Starting from a linear sigma model, we have explored some applications of WZW terms
involving vector, axial-vector, and pseudoscalar fields, giving particular focus to the implica-
tions of vorticity as an emergent axial gauge field proposed in Ref. [36]. By first deriving the
WZW effective action up to fourth order in fields via a derivative expansion method intro-
duced in Ref. [49] and confirming the results in ChPT [51}{54), we showed that our effective
action reproduces the consistent anomaly for Abelian vector and axial-vector fields. We also
derived the anomalous terms which couple external baryon and isospin chemical potentials
to pions in a magnetic field, which are responsible for the CSL phase in QCD [59].
Through interpreting the axial-vector field as the vorticity, we found electromagnetic and
vortical couplings to charged pions. The new terms encompass the anomalous current under
the presence of vorticity, the anomalous angular momentum in a magnetic field, and the

vorticity-modified photon-pion coupling. The last is expected to affect the current-current
12

correlators relevant to photon and dilepton production in a pion gas, as well as charged pion
condensation in the presence of rotation and magnetic fields [60}H63].

The primary applications of our results lie in the context of heavy ion collisions. In
future work, it would be interesting, e.g., to evaluate the vorticity-induced corrections to
the dilepton production rate from a thermal pion gas, complementing those from quark-
gluon plasmas in Refs. [44}{46]. Since these phenomena occur at nonzero temperatures, our
results should be extended to include thermal effects.

While the HME in Ref. [86] can be derived from our WZW terms by following the
procedure in Ref. [6] (see also Ref. [64]), it is expected from anomaly matching that the
HME should emerge also from the low-energy gapless modes once Dirac fermions dynamically
acquire a mass. Such terms, however, do not appear in our present analysis. Similarly, we
have not obtained the couplings between neutral pions or 7’ to vorticity at finite zg and/or
fir, which were obtained via anomaly matching in Refs. [18} BI]. It would be interesting to
establish these effects through an alternative derivation. We leave these questions for future

work.

Appendix A: Details of the derivation of Eq. (20)

This appendix includes details of our derivation of 'ggy.4 to demonstrate the application
of the derivative expansion method of fermion determinants outlined in Sec.[[]]and developed

in Ref. [49]. We begin from the third-order term in the expansion (19a), which we can write
13

as

where X = p* — m?. Note also that the pseudoscalar fields appear from the second-order
term in the expansion Pp = i07° —0?/2!+... for small 6. By expanding the numerators,
we find that the terms proportional to m? are the only ones with a nonzero Dirac trace.
When using dimensional regularization, one should evaluate the Dirac trace after performing
the momentum integration. This is due to the ambiguity of defining 7° in d dimensions. We
use the interpretation in Ref. [69] in such situations where divergent momentum integrals
require the Dirac trace to be evaluated in d dimensions to find finite results. For ease of

reference, here are some general integral results computed via dimensional regularization:

+NaNve + upNve) ,
where ['(x) is the Gamma function. (The integrals with odd number of momenta in the
numerator vanish.) One can usually judge whether divergent integrals will be encountered
in the calculation simply from power counting in momentum. For the term (Alp, we expect
that the momentum integrals in d = 4 should be finite, so we evaluate the Dirac trace
immediately. We have

where we moved all the momentum operators in the numerators to the left in the second
line using Eq. (9). Now we also move all factors of X~! to the left. This can be done freely
for any terms already of the required order in derivatives. Here, we are only interested in

terms up to second order in derivatives. Thus, the only change in the above is

using the commutation relation (LO). With our expression in the form of Eq. (8). we can
now perform the momentum integrals using Eqs. (A2) to find

An almost identical calculation starting from the term (19b) yields

similar to before, we write as

mi 5 / dz Tr (0,,000,Va — 90,,00,Va — O,00,0V) Ag , (A9)

for term (18a). The other terms (18b) and (18c) at O(m*) similarly become

i Vo,

mm B / d‘x Tr (0,000, Aq — 00,00) Aq + 30,00,0Aq) Vo , (Al0a)
i Vor

aa B / d*a Tr (—0,0V.0,0 + 00, Va0,0 + 0,00,Vo9) Ag , (A10b)

respectively.

At O(m?), we see that we may encounter divergent integrals. Out of this consideration

and convenience, we define

EMA = Trp opp yyy Ph yoy? (All)

and leave its evaluation until later. Applying the commutation relations as before,

where we used EMVABLTD D,DaPp = 0 ind dimensions. This removes the only potentially
divergent term. We then integrate over the momentum. After contracting the spacetime
indices and simplifying the remaining expression, we find

i

ae / de Tr (0,000,Ve. — 00,00,Va + O,00,0Va) Ag . (A13)

In a similar manner, we obtain

4872

eve / d*a Tr (0,800, Aa — 90,00, Aq + 0,00,0Aa) Vi; (Alda)

at O(m?) from terms (18b) and (18c) respectively.

In total,

which, after partially integrating and dropping boundary terms, becomes Eq. (20).
