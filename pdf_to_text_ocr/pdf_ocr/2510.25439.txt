Simulating finite temperature phase transitions from first-principles is computationally challenging. Re-
cently, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) have opened a
new avenue for finite-temperature calculations with near-first-principles accuracy. Here we use MLFFs, gen-
erated using on-the-fly training, to investigate structural phase transitions in four of the most well-studied
ferroelectric oxides; BaTiO3, PbTiO3, LINDO; and BiFeO;. Only using the 0 K ground state structure as in-
put for the training, the resulting MLFFs can qualitatively predict all the main structural phases and phase
transitions, while the quantitative results are sensitive to the choice of exchange correlation functional with
PBEsol found to be more robust than LDA and r?SCAN. MD simulations also reproduce the experimen-
tally observed order-disorder character of Ti displacements in BaTiO3, the abrupt first order transitions of
BiFeO3 and PbTiO;, and the mixed order-disorder and displacive character of the ferroelectric transition in
LiNbO3. Finally, we discuss the potential and limitations of using MLFFs for simulating ferroelectric phase

transitions.

I. INTRODUCTION

Ferroelectric oxides, particularly perovskites, are of great
technological and scientific interest and find applications
in, e.g. sensors, actuators, transducers, and non-volatile
memory technologies [1-3]. The mechanisms of their fer-
roelectric phase transitions are imperative in order to un-
derstand the microscopic origins of spontaneous polarisa-
tion, and is thus enabling knowledge for designing new and
improved ferroelectrics. Although first-principles compu-
tational approaches have been tremendously successful in
elucidating fundamental properties and mechanisms at 0
K [4-7], the corresponding finite-temperature calculations
have been prohibitively expensive. ab initio molecular dy-
namics has been feasible only for relatively small systems
where long-range electrostatic interactions, such as those
in ferroelectrics, are not well captured or described.

Machine-learned force fields (MLFFs), and in particular
on-the-fly MLFFs [8, 9] have recently opened a new avenue
for finite-temperature calculations with near-first-principles
accuracy. Potentials are trained using a combination of
molecular dynamics (MD), density functional theory (DFT),
and machine learning to decide when to perform DFT steps
and update force fields [10]. This approach can be utilised
to train force fields for complex functional materials and al-
low for calculations of very large supercells that are not fea-
sible using standard DFT. MLFFs have recently been used to
predict phase transitions in a wide range of materials [11-
20], but ferroelectric materials and their phase transitions
pose an additional challenge with their sensitivity to pres-
sure and lattice parameters, and inherent balance between
long- and short-range forces [21, 22].

Ferroelectric materials show an electric field-switchable
spontaneous electric polarisation that emerges from a phase
transition from a centrosymmetric high-temperature struc-
ture to a non-centrosymmetric low-temperature structure

at the Curie temperature (Tc). BaTiO3, PbTiO3, BiFeO3,
and LiNbO are prototypical ferroelectric materials, with
the first three belonging to the perovskite family, whereas
LiNbO adopts a closely related structure. These four fer-
roelectric oxides span I-V, I-IV and III-III distributions of
formal oxidation states, they include two examples of d°-
driven second-order Jahn-Teller mechanism of stabilising
polarisation, and two examples of A-site 6s” lone pair-
driven polarisation, the latter two of which we find one
multiferroic with a non-d° B-site (BiFeO,) and one with a
d° B-site (PbTiO;) cation. These four well-studied oxides
thus constitute a robust testing ground for applying MLFFs
to understand ferroelectric phase transitions and we briefly
review the basics of their phase transitions below.

BaTiO, undergoes three phase transitions upon heat-

. ~193 K ~273 K 393 K = .
ing; R3m « > Amm2 « > P4mm —> Pm3m with
the latter being the paraelectric aristotype phase [23]. All
three phase transitions are first order and are associated
with diverging dielectric constants and discontinuous vol-
umes. While BaTiO3 is a prototypical displacive (soft-mode
driven) ferroelectric, recent studies support a microscopic
order-disorder picture rather than coherent, uniform dis-
placements of Ti** relative to the centre of mass of the TiO,
octahedra [24-29].

In contrast to BaTiO3, PbTiO3, LiNbO, and BiFeO3 each
exhibit only a single bulk ferroelectric phase. PbTiO; un-

: 8 768 K 7
dergoes a first-order transition, P4mm <—> Pm3m[30],
which is accompanied by a large, discontinuous decrease in

molar volume. LiNbO; keeps its trigonal symmetry across

. as ~1480 K
the polar to non-polar ferroelectric transition, R3c <——>

R3c[31, 32].

The ferroelectric phase transition of BiFeO, initially
proved difficult to study experimentally [33, 34] because of
the high T¢, the volatility of Bi, and the chemical incompat-
ibility towards common sample supporting materials like
platinum, alumina (Al,03) and silica (SiO,)[35]. Arnold

et al. conclusively established the nature of the ferroelec-

tric transition of BiFeO3 to be R3c cs Pbnm[36]. The

absence of a group-subgroup relationship between Pbnm
and R3c implies that this transition must be first order, and
this is corroborated by a large negative change in molar
volume and discontinuous enthalpy and electrical resistiv-
ity across T,[36, 37]. An even more debated phase transi-
tion of BiFeO3 is that from paraelectric Pbnm (the 6-phase,
Pnma is the standard setting) to the elusive y-phase, occur-
ring just ~ 10 K below the peritectic decomposition temper-
ature of ~ 1200 K [34, 35, 38].

In this work, we generate and use machine-learned force
fields (MLFFs) as interatomic potentials to accurately pre-
dict phase transitions in the well-known ferroelectric ox-
ides BaTiO3, PbTiO3, LiNbO, and BiFeO3. We use only their
ground state structure as input for training the force fields.
Similar to 0 K first-principles calculations, we show that the
quantitative results are strongly dependent on the choice of
exchange-correlation functional. Finally, we discuss the po-
tential and limitations of MLFFs for studying ferroelectrics.

II. METHODS

Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynam-
ics (MD) calculations were performed using the VASP code
[39-41]. Interactions between core and valence electrons
(Ba: (5s”, 5p°, 5d°°1, 6s!°°), Ti: (3s, 3p°, 3d°, 4s1), O:
(2s?, 2p*), Pb: (5d?°, 6s”, 6p), Li: (1s?, 21), Nb: (4s?,
4p°, 4d*, 5s1), Bi: (5d?°, 6s”, 6p%), Fe: (3s, 3p°, 3d’,
4s1)) were described using the projector-argumented wave
(PAW) method [42, 43]. A large plane-wave energy cutoff
of 700 eV was used for all DFT calculations to avoid Pulay
stresses associated with the large volume changes during
the training of the MLFFs. Three sets of MLFFs were gen-
erated using LDA [44], PBEsol [45] and r°SCAN [46] and
used for MD simulations to assess the consequences of gen-
erating interatomic potentials using different functionals.
MD simulations were performed within the NpT ensemble
using the Parrinello-Rahman barostat [47, 48] with a pres-
sure of 1 atm and the Langevin thermostat [49]. Langevin
friction coefficients were set to 5 ps! for all atoms. A ficti-
tious mass of 1000 amu and a friction coefficient of 5 ps~!
were used for the lattice degrees of freedom for all simu-
lations. DFT calculations of BiFeO, were initialised with a
G-type antiferromagnetism, and a Hubbard U of 4 eV was
used when generating MLFFs with LDA and PBEsol.

An initial equilibration was first performed of the DFT op-
timised ground state structures using the on-the-fly scheme
at temperatures of 50 K, 300 K, 500 K and 500 K for BaTiO,,
PbTiO3, LiNbO; and BiFeO3, respectively. The equilibra-
tions were performed using 50000 time steps with a step
length of 1 fs. Supercells of 120 atoms, similar toa 2x2x1
expansion of the conventional R3c unit cell of LiNbO; and
BiFeO3, were used for the initial equilibrations and all train-
ing. This supercell allows for anti-phase tilting of O octa-
hedra in all directions and maximises the cell size without
making the generation of interatomic potentials too compu-
tationally demanding. y-centred k-point grids of 3x 3 x 2
were used for all DFT calculations. All interatomic poten-
tials generated during the initial equilibrations were dis-

carded.

Generation of MLFFs was done by heating (100 steps
per K) the equilibrated structures from the initial tempera-
tures to temperatures well above the respective ferroelectric
phase transition (BaTiO3: 500 K, PbTiO3: 1000 K, LiNbO3:
1700 K and BiFeO3: 1300 K) using the on-the-fly scheme.
A cutoff radius of 8 A was used to limit the atomic environ-
ments described by MLFFs. Generated MLFFs are uploaded
to zenodo [50].

Thereafter, production runs were done with equilibrium
MD simulations at specific temperatures using the gener-
ated potentials. Production runs were carried out in series,
meaning that simulations were performed from low to high
temperature, where the final structure of the previous cal-
culation was used as the initial structure of the next calcu-
lation. The length of all production runs was 40 ps with a
time step of 1 fs. For all calculations, the lattice parameters
converged within 20 ps, and only the final 20 ps of each
simulation were analysed. For PbTiO,, LINDO, and BiFeO,
a supercell containing 2000 atoms, similar toa 5 x5 x 4 ex-
pansion of the conventional Pbnm unit cell of BiFeO3, was
used for all production runs. Due to narrow temperature in-
tervals of the different phases, simulations of BaTiO, were
performed using a 4900 atom supercell (7x7 x5 expansion)
to reduce thermal fluctuations.

Ill. RESULTS

Lattice parameters as a function of temperature for
BaTiO3, PbTiO3, LiNbO; and BiFeO are displayed in Fig-
ure 1, 4, 5 and 7, respectively. The top panels show average
lattice parameters from equilibrium MD simulations using
MLFFs generated with the PBEsol functional, while the bot-
tom panels show experimental lattice parameters from the
literature [36, 51-53]. In SI Figure $4, $7, $11 and S15 the
experimental and simulated lattice parameters are plotted
together as a function normalised to the Tc. Results from
simulations using MLFFs generated with LDA and r?SCAN
are displayed in the SI Figure S6, S10, S14 and S18.

A. BaTiO,

Equilibrium MD simulations, using MLFFs generated
with PBEsol, qualitatively predict all the correct phases and
transitions for BaTiO; upon heating. Estimated phase tran-
sition temperatures are systematically about 70 K lower
than experimentally observed transition temperatures [51].
The calculated lattice parameters are in general about 0.01
A larger than the experimental values, which can be at-
tributed to the subtle underbinding tendency of PBEsol
[54]. Except for the underestimated transition tempera-
tures, the main difference between the experimental and
our calculated lattice parameters is the change in volume
over the phase transitions. Kay et al. [51] reports a small
increase in volume at the transition from R3m to Amm2 and
from Amm2 to P4mm. While our calculations predict a sub-
tle decrease in volume at these transitions, the negative vol-
ume change across the ferroelectric transition is correctly
reproduced by our simulations.

The LDA and r*SCAN functionals also predict the correct
phases and transitions. However, LDA underestimates the
lattice parameters (SI Figure S6), due to its well-known ten-
dency to overbind [55], while r?SCAN overestimates the lat-
tice parameters. Furthermore, this is reflected in the esti-
mated phase transition temperatures, where LDA predicts
erroneously low transition temperatures, while transition
temperatures from r*SCAN are closer to the experimental
values than those predicted from PBEsol (Figure 1).

FIG. 1. Evolution of lattice parameters as a function of tempera-
ture for BaTiO;. The top panel displays predicted lattice parame-
ters from MD simulations performed using MLFFs generated with
the PBEsol functional, while the bottom panel shows experimental
results from Kay et al. [51]. The dashed and dotted vertical black
lines indicate the phase transition temperatures.

The probability distributions of the absolute Ti displace-
ments in BaTiO, at various temperatures, shown in Figure
2, reveal a decrease in the Ti displacements upon heating
up to the formation of the cubic phase. As the tempera-
ture increases further, the Ti displacements gradually in-
crease. Each phase transition is marked by a step-like shift
in the peak position, as indicated by the dashed vertical
lines. Additionally, the probability distributions broaden
with increasing temperature, reflecting enhanced thermal
fluctuations.

The direction of the Ti displacements at 50 K, 150 K,
250 K and 350 K are displayed using Mercator projections
shown in Figure 3. At 50 K, all Ti atoms are displayed in
one of the (1, 1, 1) directions, consistent with the R3m space
group. At 150 K, Ti atoms are displaced in two different
(1,1,1) directions, and the average orientation of the dis-
placements gives rise to the direction of the macroscopic
polarisation observed in orthorhombic BaTiO3. Moreover,

in BaTiO, from equilibrium MD simulations using MLFFs gener-
ated with PBEsol. The colours indicate the average space groups
(turquoise: R3m, orange: Amm2, blue: P4mm, green: Pm3m)
and the dashed vertical lines are guidelines for the peak positions.

at 250 K, Ti atoms are disordered in between four different
(1,1, 1) directions, where the average gives rise to tetrag-
onal BaTiO;. At 350 K, the orientation of the Ti displace-
ments is disordered between all (1, 1,1) directions. A sim-
ilar cation off-centring has, for instance, been reported by
K. Page et al. for Nb-substituted cubic BaTiO; [56]. Ther-
mal energy gives broader distributions, making the disorder
between (1, 1,1) directions at higher temperatures less ob-
vious.

The temperature-dependent evolution of Ti displace-
ments, as visualised in the Mercator projections, clearly
supports the the order-disorder picture of phase transitions
in BaTiO; [24-27, 57, 58]. Similar to work by Holma et
al. [28], our calculations do not support the formation of
static linear chains of correlated displacements proposed by
Comes et al. [24, 58], but are instead more consistent with
the dynamic description by Hiiller et al. and Harada et al.
[29, 59, 60].

B. PbTiO,

Simulations of PbTiO; using PBEsol, Figure 4, show the
same lattice parameter evolution as reported from the semi-
nal experiments by Shirane et al. [52], albeit a significantly
lower transition temperature of about 230 K. Both simula-
tions and experiments show a slowly decreasing cell volume
with increasing temperature up until the phase transition
followed by a significant reduction at the transition temper-
ature. Thereafter, a slow increase in volume with increas-
ing temperature is observed. Similar results are shown by

FIG. 3. Mercator projections showing the direction of the Ti displacements in BaTiO at 50 K, 150 K, 250 K and 350 K extracted from

equilibrium MD simulations using MLFFs generated with the PBEso!

functional. Small orange data points display the direction of the

displacement of single Ti atoms from the centre of the respective O octahedra relative to the (1,0,0) (green squares) and (1,1,1) (blue
diamonds) directions. Mercator projections for the orientation of the Ba displacements are shown in SI Figure S5.

LDA and r°SCAN and are displayed in SI Figure $10. LDA,
again, severely underestimates the lattice parameters and
the phase transition temperature, while r?SCAN overesti-
mates the lattice parameters.

Probability distributions of the displacements of Pb and Ti
from the centre of oxygen polyhedra, in SI Figure $1, show
that both cations are significantly displaced at all tempera-
tures. These distributions show a clear change in trend and
jump in peak position from 500 K to 550 K (see also plotted
peak positions in SI Figure $2). Similar to the ferroelectric
transition in BaTiO3, at the Tc, the average atomic displace-
ments from polyhedral centres reverts from decreasing, go
through a minimum and start increasing upon further heat-
ing.

Contrary to BaTiO3, in the P4mm phase, cation displace-
ments in PbTiO; are not disordered and only displaced
along one (0,0, 1) direction, as reported experimentally by
Kwei et al. [26] and supported by the Mercator projections
in SI Figure S8 and S9. Above the Tc, in the paraelectric
phase, the displacements are fully disordered in all direc-
tions.

The average B-cation displacement was also fitted as a
function of the temperature to the power law A(T, —T)*,
giving a value of 0.27 for the critical exponent f. This is
reasonably close to the theoretical prediction of 0.25 for
a tricritical phase transition, as expected for PbTiO3. For
more details on the calculation of critical exponents, see SI
Section II.

FIG. 4. Evolution of lattice parameters as a function of tempera-

eters from the MD simulations using MLFFs generated with the
PBEsol functional, while the bottom panel shows experimental re-
sults from Shirane et al. [52]. The dashed and dotted vertical
black lines indicate the phase transition temperatures.
C. LiNbO,

Similar to lattice parameters from experiments by Lehn-
ert et al. [53] and Sugii et al. [61], the calculated a lattice
parameter increases linearly up to and beyond the phase
transition, while the c parameter starts decreasing when
approaching the phase transition temperature (Figure 5).
Due to the second-order nature of the phase transition in
LiNbO}, the Curie temperature is very difficult to estimate
exclusively from the changes in lattice parameters alone.
However, similar to the probability distributions for cation
displacements in BaTiO3, PbTiO, and BiFeO, (SI Figure $1),
there is a clear abrupt change in the evolution of the abso-
lute displacements of Li and Nb from 1100 K to 1200 K, in-
dicating the T, to be in between these temperatures. Using
MLFFs generated with PBEsol, the predicted T¢ is about 300

K lower than the experimentally observed T,. With LDA
and r?SCAN, lattice parameters are again underestimated
and overestimated, respectively, see SI Figure $14.

FIG. 5. Evolution of lattice parameters as a function of tempera-
ture for LiINbO,. Lattice parameters are converted from the hexag-
onal conventional unit cell to a pseudocubic cell by dividing a and
c by V2 and 12, respectively. The top panel displays predicted
lattice parameters from the MD simulations using MLFFs gener-
ated with the PBEsol functional, while the bottom panel shows
experimental results from Lehnert et al. [53]. The dashed and
lotted vertical black lines indicate the phase transition tempera-
tures.

Below the Tc, both Li and Nb are displaced along the
same (1,1,1) direction. Displacements along this [1,1,1]
direction, displayed in Figure 6, highlight the differences
between Li and Nb when approaching the phase transi-
tion temperature. Li, Figure 6 (a), clearly show an order-
disorder transition, while Nb show a displacive transition.
Similar distributions and results have been reported from ab
initio MD by Sanna et al. [62]. The order-disorder and the
displacive transitions are also clearly shown in the Mercator

projections in SI Figure $12 and S13, respectively. Mixed
displacive and order-disorder characteristics of a ferroelec-
tric transition have also been observed for other uniaxial
ferroelectrics like hexagonal manganites, h-RMnO [63].

From 1100 K to 1200 K, at the estimated Tc, there is a
jump in the evolution of the displacements of both Li and
Nb. However, the distributions of Li and Nb indicate that
the material is still weakly polar, which could be explained
by insufficient thermal energy to reach full ergodicity within
the limited simulation time analysed.

A power law fitting of the average B-cation displacement
resulted in a 6-value of 0.34, in very good agreement with
the expected value for a second-order ferroelectric phase
transition, as well as the experimental value of 6 = 0.355
measured for isostructural LiTaO; [64].

D. BiFeO,

Both the non-linearity and the thermal stability of the fer-
roelectric R3c phase of BiFeOs is fairly well described by the
PBEsol-based simulations, including the premonitory phe-
nomenon of the lattice parameter c, parallel to the sponta-
neous polarisation (similar to LINbO3), starting to contract
as Tc, is approached [36]. The large negative and discon-
tinuous volume change across the ferroelectric phase tran-
sition of BiFeO, is also reproduced, as shown in Figure 7, in
agreement with Arnold etal. [36].

At the Tc, MLFFs generated using LDA and PBEsol pre-
dict a transition from rhombohedral R3c to orthorhombic
Pbnm, with LDA again underestimating the lattice parame-
ters. r?Scan, on the other hand, gives a qualitatively differ-
ent result and shows a transition from R3c directly to cubic
Pm3m. Using LDA and PBEsol, the difference between the
calculated a, b, and c lattice parameters in the Pbnm phase
is substantially larger than experimentally reported. How-
ever, DFT-optimised lattice parameters at 0 K give similar
values, see SI Table $1.

The volume contraction of the unit cell is also reflected
in the distributions of absolute cation displacements, shown
in SI Figure $1, with drastic changes to the peak positions
for both the Bi and Fe distributions. Except for the abnor-
mal changes at the Tc, these peak positions show only a
weak temperature dependence (SI Figure $2). These dis-
tributions show increased broadening as a function of in-
creasing temperature for the displacements of both Bi and
Fe.

The Mercator projections for Bi and Fe, in SI Figure $16
and S17, are relatively similar to the Mercator projections
for LiNbO3, with the main differences being a very abrupt
phase transition in BiFeO3 and the fact that the displace-
ments of Bi are not disordered, but instead ordered in an
alternating fashion in the high-temperature phase, in agree-
ment with the structural degrees of freedom of the paraelec-
tric Pbnm phase.

IV. DISCUSSIONS

The observed underestimation of phase transition tem-
peratures may be caused by several factors. Finite size ef-
fects, due to the use of limited cell sizes and periodic bound-
ary conditions during both generation of MLFFs and pro-
duction runs, will prevent the system from behaving as it
would have done at the thermodynamic limit. As ferroelec-
tric phase transitions are governed by long-range collective
displacements of atoms, local fluctuations of the positions
of individual atoms may easily destabilise the ferroic order.
Moreover, MLFFs in VASP only describe the environment
around atoms closer than a specific cutoff radius (default:
8 A), and thus, long-range interactions are not directly de-
scribed by the generated MLFFs. Furthermore, ferroelectric
materials often experience decreasing and more diffuse T,
with decreasing particle sizes [65-72]. Strain from the sur-
faces hinders the collective displacements and suppresses
the ferroelectric phase.

A larger cutoff radius as well as larger supercells for both
production runs and training of the interatomic potentials
may mitigate the present errors in transition temperatures.
However, increasing the cell size significantly will be com-
putationally expensive. Supporting this notion, it has been
reported that for LINDO; performing ab initio MD with a
80 atom supercell underestimates the T, significantly [62],
while a 640 atom supercell gives a Tc very close to the ex-
perimental value [73]. Additionally, generating MLFFs us-
ing different exchange correlation functionals has proven to
give vastly different transition temperatures [12, 13], and
thus, finding the optimal functional for the system is cru-

cial. As of now, there is no "safe" choice of a single func-
tional for training MLFFs for predicting ferroelectric phase
transitions.

In BaTiO3, the spontaneous polarisation is solely due to
second-order Jahn-Teller distortions caused by partial co-
valency between Ti 3d and O 2p. This results in Ti being
displaced towards one of the faces of the O octahedron,
causing polarisation in one of the (1,1,1) directions. The
other directions of polarisation observed experimentally are
just combinations of polarisation in multiple (1, 1, 1) direc-
tions, as visualised with the Mercator projections in Figure
3. PbTiO, also has Ti d®, but only shows polarisation in the
(0,0, 1) directions, reflecting that the lone pair, caused by
hybridisation of Pb 6s and 6p states, dictates the direction
of the polarisation and the strongly coupled unit cell distor-
tion. Furthermore, G. Laurita et al. showed that the intro-
duction of lone pair cations, by Sn-substitution in BaTiO3,
drives local ordering and results in a behaviour closely re-
sembling that of PbTiO, [74].

Similar to BaTiO3, polarisation in LiNbO is only caused
by d° second-order Jahn-Teller distortions. In spite of this,
LiNbO, only show two different phases (R3c and R3c). The
small size of Li atoms stabilises antiferrodistortive rotations
and thus also the R3c and R3c phases. This also explains
the order-disorder character of Li observed in Figure 6 (a)

FIG. 7. Evolution of lattice parameters as a function of tempera-
ture for BiFeO,. Similar to LiNbO,, in the rhombohedral phase,
lattice parameters are converted from the hexagonal conventional
unit cell to a pseudocubic cell by dividing a and c by V2 and /12,
respectively. Lattice parameters from the orthorhombic structure
are converted by dividing a/b and c by 2 and 2, respectively. The
top panel displays predicted lattice parameters from the MD sim-
ulations in this work, while the bottom panel shows experimental
results from Arnold et al. [36]. The dashed and dotted vertical
black lines indicate the phase transition temperatures.

metrically distorted. This is one possible reason why a tran-
sition to the experimentally observed y-phase is not found
in our simulations. Another obvious reason for the discrep-
ancy is the possible evaporation of Bi and O at high tem-
peratures, which would be very challenging to accurately
predict and represent computationally. Our current sim-
ulations within the isothermal-isobaric NpT ensemble do
not allow exchange of particles, and extending the MLFF
approach to the grand canonical ensemble implies several
challenges we will not discuss further here. Experiments
where 30 molar % of Fe has been replaced by Mn to lower
the structural phase transition temperatures agree on the T;
and the symmetries of the ferroelectric and the paraelectric
phases, but not on the y-phase [75, 76], emphasizing the
challenging nature of this particular phase transition and
the need for further work to clarify e.g. the possible role of
non-stoichiometry.

In general, except for special situations, the choice of
functional does not change the results qualitatively. More-
over, disregarding thermal expansion, the generated MLFFs
closely follow lattice parameters from regular DFT calcula-
tions with the respective functional. LDA is known to un-
derestimate lattice parameters [77], which is reflected in
the MD simulations using MLFFs generated with LDA. This
leads to further underestimation of phase transition tem-

7

peratures, which can make it difficult to separate and study
phases that experimentally show narrow temperature win-
dows such as BaTiO. Similarly, r>SCAN has been shown to,
on average, overestimate lattice parameters [46], and our
MD simulations, performed using MLFFs generated with
r’SCAN, also tend to overestimate lattice parameters. Fur-
thermore, these MLFFs fail to correctly describe both phase
transitions in BiFeO3, which may partly be due to the over-
estimated lattice parameters. Our results suggest that func-
tionals that agree well with experimental values at the DFT
level also result in MLFFs that accurately describe lattice pa-
rameters at elevated temperatures. Therefore, PBEsol is, in
most situations, a good choice in terms of both speed and
accuracy.
A major advantage of using MD simulations is access
to massive supercells. This can allow for calculations of
larger phenomena such as surfaces, grain boundaries, su-
perstructures, amorphous materials, nanoparticles, and do-
main walls and their interactions with defects. The flexi-
bility of using on-the-fly machine-learned interatomic po-
tentials makes it easy to apply the methodology shown in
this work to phenomena such as those mentioned above,
as well as to completely new and unknown systems. The
balance between long-range and short-range electrostatic
forces, and the dipole-stabilizing second-order Jahn-Teller
effect (or improper ferroelectric mechanisms) is particu-
larly challenging for MLFFs, necessarily leading to difficult
trade-offs between cost and accuracy. However, this also
implies that ferroelectrics are ideal test beds for further
method development of MLFF approaches to achieve near-
first-principles accuracy at a fraction of the cost.

Vs CONCLUSIONS

We have demonstrated that we can accurately predict lat-
tice parameters and phase transitions of ferroelectric mate-
rials using MLFFs trained from first-principles calculations.
Qualitatively, our calculations get all the correct phases
and transitions, except for the 6-y transition in BiFeOs, al-
though predicted phase-transition temperatures are in gen-
eral significantly lower than what is observed experimen-
tally. This method can be used to resolve and describe more
subtle structural changes, such as the magnitude of the B-
cation displacements and the orientation of these displace-
ments.

All data presented in figures in the SI, unless explicitly stated, show results from MD simulations
using MLFFs generated with the PBEsol functional. In general, the different functionals lead to
qualitatively similar results, and thus, presenting all the data from the three different functionals
investigated in this work is somewhat superfluous. We chose PBEsol to represent our results as it
has been shown to give lattice parameters close to experimental values [1-3]. The main differences
between the different functionals are the calculated lattice parameters and are highlighted in SI

Figure $6, 510, S14 and $18.

I. A- AND B-CATION DISPLACEMENTS

Figure 51 shows probability distributions of the absolute displacements of cations from the O
polyhedra centre calculated using the MLFFs generated using the PBEsol functional. From top
to bottom, the panels show distributions for BaTiO3, PbTiO3, LiNbO3 and BiFeO3. The left
and right panels display A-and B-cation displacements, respectively. The different colours indicate
different phases and the brightness shows the temperature from which the distribution is extracted.
The brightness of the colours increases with increasing temperature within the same phase. The
yeak position of the B-cation distributions is shown in SI Figure $2.

PbTiO3 shows the largest B-cation displacements in the ferroelectric phase. In the paraelec-
ric phase, the magnitude of the displacements is closely linked to the temperature, consequently
BaTiOs shows the smallest displacements while LiNbOs shows the largest displacements. All com-
pounds in the ferroelectric phase, except BiFeO3, show a clear reduction in B-cation displacements

with increasing temperature. In contrast, the Fe displacements in BiFeO3 increase slightly at low

emperatures and start decreasing when approaching the phase transition temperature. In the

* selbach@ntnu.no
paraelectric phase, displacements increase approximately linearly with increasing temperature for

the investigated materials.

II. CRITICAL EXPONENTS

To verify the correct characteristics of the ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transitions, we
also investigated the power law behaviour of the order parameters and determined the critical
exponent 3. This value can indicate whether the transition is strictly first-order, second-order or
shares features of both. For each material, the average B-cation displacement as a function of the
temperature was fitted to the expression f(T) = A(T¢ — T)°. For the 6-values and the curve fit,
see Fig. $3. For BaTiO3 and BiFeOs, the values are very small, consistent with an abrupt jump
in the order parameter, as expected from first-order transitions. This also means that the values
do not correspond to any theoretical models.
However, for PbTiOz and LiNbOs3 the values fit well with experiment and theoretical predictions.
For PbTiO3, 6 = 0.27 is close to the theoretical value of 0.25 for a tricritical phase transition, which
represents the boundary between first-order and second-order. This agrees with the first-order

transition of PbTiO; becoming second-order under applied pressure [4, 5]. A 6-value of 0.34 is the
observed and theoretically predicted value for a second-order ferroelectric transition, and has been
measured to be 0.355 for isostructural LiTaO3 [6].

Fitting the strain instead of the polarization, in the form of the tetragonal distortion (c— a)/c,
resulted in essentially the same values. Fitting to other critical exponents than 3 was not attempted

due to the difficulty of fitting a diverging parameter so close to the critical point.

Ill. BaTiO;

SI Figure S4 shows lattice parameters, calculated using PBEsol, plotted on top of experimental
lattice parameters as a function of temperature normalised to Tc. The trend of the lattice pa-
rameters is relatively similar for all phases. For the R3m phase the calculated lattice parameters
are about 0.01 A longer. The Amm2 and P4mm phases show good overlap for the a-parameter,
while our calculations tend to overestimate the longer lattice parameters. For the Pm3m phase,

our calculations show perfect overlap with the experimental data from Kay et al. [7].

Normalised Temperature

FIG. $4, Lattice parameters, calculated using PBEsol, compared to experimental lattice parameters by Kay

et al. [7] as a function of temperature normalised to Tc.

Mercator projections showing the direction of Ti displacements at 4 different temperatures are
displayed in Figure 3. SI Figure $5 displays Mercator projections showing the direction of the Ba
displacements at the same temperatures. The directions of the Ba displacements closely follow the
Ti displacements, albeit they appear to be a bit more widespread. However, this is likely mainly
an artefact of Ba being less displaced than Ti, see SI Figure S1.

SI Figure S6 shows calculated lattice parameters using MLFFs generated using different func-

tionals for BaTiOg. The training of interatomic potentials was carried out using the procedure

described in the method section in the main text. The MLFF's predict all the correct phases and
phase transitions, albeit with very different lattice parameters and transition temperatures. There
is a clear connection between calculated lattice parameter and transition temperatures, where in-
creasing separation between the lattice parameters gives higher transition temperatures. r>SCAN
gives transition temperatures closest to the experimental values, but significantly overestimates
the lattice parameters. PBEsol results in lattice parameters closest to experimental values. Lattice
parameters from LDA are not well described, as the temperature intervals are narrow and close to

the transition temperature, lattice parameters tend to fluctuate between the different phases.

Normalised Temperature

FIG. $7. Calculated lattice parameters compared to experimental lattice parameters by Shirane et al. [8]

as a function of temperature normalised to Tc.

Similar to the relation between a- and b-cations in BaTiO3, Mercator projections showing the
direction of Pb and Ti displacements in PbTiO3, SI Figure $8 and S9, show that the Pb displace-
ments follow the Ti displacements, but again appear more widespread. Moreover, in PbTiO; the
magnitude of the Pb displacements is larger than the Ti displacements and can therefore not ex-
plain the difference. However, the Pb displacements may look more widespread as Pb is larger and
more polarisable and thus less energy is needed to slightly move it from its equilibrium position.

Estimated lattice parameters as a function of temperature for PbTiO3 using interatomic po-
tentials trained using different functionals are displayed in SI Figure $10. All the MLFF's under-
estimate the transition temperature. PBEsol results in lattice parameters that are very close to
the experimental values, while LDA and r?SCAN severely underestimates and overestimates the

lattice parameters, respectively.

V. LiNbO3

Calculated and experimental lattice parameters as a function of temperature normalised to Tc,
displayed in SI Figure $11, show a similar evolution of the structure with temperature. The calcu-
lated c-parameters are systematically larger than the experimental values, while the a-parameters
are shorter. However, there is an almost perfect overlap between the calculated and experimental

volumes.

Normalised Temperature

FIG. S11. Calculated lattice parameters compared to experimental lattice parameters by Lehnert et al.
[9] as a function of temperature normalised to Tc. Lattice parameters are converted from the hexagonal

conventional unit cell to a pseudocubic cell by dividing a/b and c by V2 and V/12, respectively.

The Mercator projections in SI Figure $12 clearly show the order-disorder transition of the Li
displacements. At low temperatures, Li is displayed along one of the (1 x 1 x 1) directions, while
at higher temperatures the displacements are split between two opposite (1 x 1 x 1) directions.
Mercator projections for Nb, Si Figure $13, show Nb following a displacive transition.

SI Figure $14 shows calculated lattice parameters using MLFFs generated using different func-
tionals for LiNbO3. The different interatomic potentials result in the correct phases, but the

different functionals all underestimate the transition temperature.

VI. BiFeO3

SI Figure $15 shows large discrepancies between calculated and experimental lattice parameters
of BiFeO3 for both the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases. However, the trends show a relatively
good match. Additionally, calculated lattice parameters closely follow lattice parameters expected

using standard DFT when considering thermal expansion. DFT optimised lattice parameters for

the Pbnm structure are shown in Table S1 and are relatively similar to the lattice parameters
calculated using MLFFs at elevated temperatures.

Normalised Temperature

FIG. $15. Calculated lattice parameters compared to experimental lattice parameters by Arnold et al. [10]
as a function of temperature normalised to Tc. Similar to LiNbO3, in the rhombohedral phase, lattice
parameters are converted from the hexagonal conventional unit cell to a pseudocubic cell by dividing a/b
and c by V2 and V/12, respectively. Lattice parameters from the orthorhombic structure are converted by
dividing a/b and c by V2 and 2, respectively.

The Mercator projections for Bi in BiFeO3, shown in SI Figure $16, appear very similar to Li
in LiNbO3. However, at elevated temperatures, Bi displacements are not disordered between two
directions, but instead ordered alternatingly. On the other hand, Fe shows a very abrupt change

from being displaced in the ferroelectric phase to not being displaced above the Tc, see SI Figure
