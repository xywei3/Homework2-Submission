We present a simulation-based forward-modeling framework for cosmological inference from op-
tical galaxy-cluster samples, and apply it to the abundance and weak-lensing signals of DES-Y1
redMaPPer clusters. The model embeds cosmology-dependent optical selection using a counts-in-
cylinders approach, while also accounting for cluster miscentering and baryonic feedback in lensing.
Applied to DES-Y1, and assuming a flat ACDM cosmology, we obtain Q,, = 0.25479-026 and
og = 082673523, consistent with a broad suite of low-redshift structure measurements, including
recent full-shape analyses, the DES/KiDS/HSC 3x2 results, and most cluster-abundance studies.
Our results are also consistent with Planck, with the difference being significant at 2.580. These
results establish simulation-based forward-modeling of cluster abundances as a promising new tool
for precision cosmology with Stage IV survey data.

I. INTRODUCTION

Galaxy clusters have long been recognized as a pow-
erful probe of dark energy, provided that cluster selec-
tion can be adequately characterized [1, 2]. In optical
data this has been especially difficult: in DES-Y1, the
redMaPPer abundance analysis was biased by unmodeled
selection effects imprinted on the clusters’ weak-lensing
signals Abbott et al. [3]. Further work demonstrated that
projection effects in galaxy clusters significantly perturb
the clusters’ weak lensing profiles [4], explaining the ori-
gin of this bias. These realizations led to improved mod-
eling in which the impact of projection effects was param-
eterized based on numerical simulations [5, 6]. While this
approach succeeded in achieving unbiased cosmological
analyses, the increased number of parameters degraded
the constraining power of the cluster samples.

In parallel, a new generation of simulation-based in-
ference frameworks has emerged for large-scale struc-
ture analyses [e.g. 7-10]. We extend this philosophy
to optical cluster cosmology by embedding cosmology-
dependent selection and projection directly in a fully
simulated inference pipeline. In [11] we introduced a
forward-modeling framework that populates halos with

* ansalcedo@arizona.edu

galaxies and builds synthetic cluster catalogs to model
the clusters’ lensing signal. We found that unlike in the
original DES analysis, the abundance and weak-lensing
signal of DES-Y1 redMaPPer clusters are consistent with
the Planck ACDM best fit. Here we extend that frame-
work to enable full cosmological inference and apply it
to the DES-Y1 redMaPPer sample. Because we can reli-
ably model cluster selection at lower richness, we include
all clusters with A > 10, a threshold half that of Abbott
et al. [3], enabling us to increase the statistical precision
of our results.

The layout of the paper is as follows. In Section II, we
summarize the observational and simulation data that
underpins our analysis. In Section III we describe how
we populate numerical simulations with galaxies, and
provide a brief overview of how we use the resulting
galaxy catalogs to characterize the weak lensing signal
of redMaPPer galaxy clusters. Section IV and V de-
scribe how we model the abundance and weak lensing
data from the simulations, while section VIC describes
our likelihood functions and the emulator design used to
interpolate simulation results. Section VII presents our
results, while section VIII summarizes our results and
presents our conclusions.
II. DATA
A. DES Data

We analyze measurements of the lensing and
abundance of 24,616 clusters identified by the red-
sequence Matched-filter Probabilistic Percolation algo-
rithm [redMaPPer; 12] in the 1321 +116 deg? of DES-Y1
imaging data [13]. The redMaPPer algorithm identifies
galaxy clusters as overdensities of red-sequence galaxies,
using a matched filter approach to estimate the member-
ship probability of each red-sequence galaxy within an
empirically defined cluster radius.

Our cluster sample is separated into three redshift bins
with bin edges at z = [0.2, 0.35, 0.50, 0.65]. Each redshift
in is further separated into six bins of richness with
in edges at A [10, 14, 20, 30, 45,60, oo]. Here, » is
he number of optical galaxies ciated with a given
cluster. We note this choice contrasts with the existing
cluster literature utilizing redMaP Per, which is limited to
A > 20 in order to maintain purity of the resulting sam-
le. Our framework obviates the need for a sample with
high purity because non-cluster contaminants are self-
consistently included in our forward-modeling, enabling
us to exploit the statistics at low richness.

For each of our richness and redshift bins, cluster shear
rofiles were measured using the DES-Y1 METACALI-
BRATION shape catalog [14] and the BPZ photometric
redshift catalog [15]. The profiles were boost factor cor-
rected using the results of [16]. The full details of this
measurement are found in [17].

B. Simulation Data

Our analysis forward-models cluster selection by pop-
ulating dark matter halos in simulations using a Halo
Occupation Distribution (HOD) framework. Because
he redMaPPer cluster finding algorithm counts galaxies
down to a luminosity threshold of 0.2L, [12], the simu-
ations used in our analysis must resolve halos down to
Mo00om 2 5 X 101! h-+ Mo [11]. Assuming these ha-
los are resolved with ~ 100 particles, the particle mass
must be lower than 5 x 10° h>! Ma. At the same time,
accurate modeling of high-mass clusters requires a large
simulation volume, and therefore very large numbers of
articles. We are able to satisfy these twin constraints us-
ing the AbacusSummit simulations suite! [18] thanks to
heir unique combination of volume (Lpox = 2.0 hot Gpc)
and mass resolution (Npart = 61923 particles of mass
Mpart ~ 2 x 109h71! Mo).

The simulations are run with the ABACUS [19-22] cos-
mological N-body code, which uses GPUs and novel com-
putational techniques to achieve high speed and accuracy.

The spline force softening length is ¢g = 7.2h~!kpe.
Our analysis relies on the 52 emulator grid simulations
sampling from a parameter space based on a broadened
Planck posterior [23]. The samples further impose the
requirement that the CMB acoustic scale is fixed at
100 x 6, = 1.041533.2. We augment these 52 simula-
tions with an additional simulation at the Planck cos-
mology [23]. We note that all simulations used the same
seed, which improves interpolation accuracy across sim-
ulations but means our model predictions suffer from the
cosmic variance associated with the volume of the Aba-
cusSummit simulations. However, this volume is several
‘imes larger than the volume of any of the DES-Y1 red-
shift bins. Moreover, the dominant source of statistical
uncertainty in the measurements is not cosmic variance
but rather shape noise.
Our analysis uses simulation redshift snapshots at
z = 0.3, z = 0.4, and z = 0.5. Halos are identified
from particle snapshots using the COMPASO halo finder
24]. We use the “cleaned” CoMPASO halo catalogs and
adopt as the halo center for each of our distinct halos the
center-of-mass of their most massive embedded subhalo,
as recommended in Hadzhiyska et al. [24].
While the AbacusSummit suite is well-suited to our
purposes, it inevitably imposes some external priors on
our cluster analysis. First, all of the simulation cos-
mologies have a fixed 6,. Second, and more importantly,
he range of cosmologies sampled in the AbacusSummit
suite is relatively limited in Qy and og, as illustrated
in Figure 1. These cosmologies were selected to lie on
a multi-dimensional ellipsoid, whose location and extent
was meant to comfortably encompass the allowed param-
eter space from the combination of CMB and large-scale
structure data [18]. The ellipsoid spans between 60 and
80 fluctuations in cosmological parameters, except for
the parameter og, whose range was further extended by
+0.06.
We estimate the ellipsoid enclosing the simulated Aba-
cusSummit cosmologies, and consider two different anal-
yses. The first anal adopts a flat prior within the
interior of the Ab ummit ellipsoid and sets the prior
to zero outside of this ellipsoid, which is meant to repre-
sent a conservative characterization of cosmological con-
straints at the time the AbacusSummit suite was gener-
ated (~ 2021). For simplicity, we will refer to this con-
servative CMB+LSS prior simply as the “AbacusSum-
mit prior.” By adopting this prior we can ensure that
our simulation-based model predictions are never extrap-
olated. However, this choice of prior is unfortunately in-
formative: our cluster-based posteriors are clearly trun-
cated by this ellipsoid. Consequently, we also consider
an analysis in which we do not include the AbacusSum-
mit prior, enabling us to recover cosmological constraints

adopts a flat prior within this ellipsoid, which for brevity we
refer to as the “AbacusSummit” prior, and one that does not
adopt this prior.

from cluster abundances alone at the expense of a small
amount of model extrapolation. We have no reason to
expect a sharp change in model behavior at the bound-
ary of this ellipsoid, so we consider this second case to be
a better representation of the constraints from DES-Y1
clusters despite the need for a small amount of model
extrapolation.

Ill. SYNTHETIC CATALOG GENERATION

Our analysis relies on generating synthetic cluster cat-
alogs that mirror redMaPPer in our simulations, and us-
ing these to characterize the weak lensing signal of the
clusters. This section gives a general overview of this
methodology, with further details provided in Sections IV
and V.

A. Halo occupation distribution modeling

We populate simulated halos with galaxies according
to a Halo Occupation Distribution framework [e.g. 25-
29]. Following standard practice [28], we separate the
galaxies into satellites and centrals and parameterize

their respective mean occupations as

(Nol) = 5 [1+ ert (SEM PeMnn)) ay
Plog M
M\*
(Nsat|M) = (Neen|M) (a5); (2)
M,

where the parameter My,in represents the characteristic
halo mass required to host a central ((Neen|Mmin) = 0-5),
the parameter jog determines the sharpness of the
transition from (Ncen) = 0.0 to (Neen) = 1.0, Mj is
the characteristic halo mass required to host a satellite
((Nsat|M1) = 1.0), and a is the slope of the satellite-
occupation power law. In what follows we will also con-
sider Mog as a parameter. Moo is the mass at which
(Neat |M20) = 20, and is therefore a better representation
of the characteristic mass of a galaxy cluster.

Equations 1 and 2 give only the mean of the HOD.
The actual number of centrals placed into a given halo is
either zero or one, and is determined randomly from the
mean central occupation. The number of satellites placed
into a halo is drawn randomly from a Poisson distribution
with mean (Ngat|). We explicitly verify in Appendix A
that allowing for super-Poisson variance in the number of
satellites has no impact on our results. We use the same
random number seed when populating every simulation
to improve interpolation accuracy across simulations.

Centrals are placed at the center of their host halo,
while satellites are distributed according to a Navarro-
Frenk-White profile [NFW; 30], parameterized by halo
concentrations assigned using the relations provided by
Correa et al. [31]. These parameters are summarized in
Table I. Appendix A demonstrates our results are insen-
sitive to changing the concentration—mass relations of the
galaxies by +25%.

B. Cluster selection with counts in cylinders

We utilize the counts-in-cylinders approach of [11] [also
see 4, 34-36] by weighting each galaxy according to its
line-of-sight distance from the central halo as per the
projection model of [32]:

Abbott et al. [3] measures the width of this projec-
tion kernel in redshift 7, for DES-Y1 clusters using the
method of Costanzi et al. [32]. This measurement of o,
is therefore independent of cosmology. In practice we
adopt these measurements of 7, (see Table I) and con-
vert them to the appropriate d.y; given the cosmology of
our simulation when applying our mock cluster finder.
We define N.y; as the sum of the galaxy weights of
all galaxies within the cylinder, and within a projected

space can be found in Maksimova et al. [18]. We Latin-hypercube sample our HOD and BCM parameters uniformly in the
ranges indicated. Fixed values of the width of our assumed redshift kernel are taken from measurements of Abbott et al. [3]
using the method of Costanzi et al. [32]. Priors on miscentering parameters are taken from Zhang et al. [33].

that mimics that of the redMaPPer algorithm.

To generate a cluster catalog, we rank-order halos ac-
cording to mass. We then calculate Ny, for the mos
massive halo, and remove all galaxies within the cylin-
der from consideration for all subsequent halos. We then
move on to the next most massive halo, and iterate unti
we run out of halos of mass above 10!+-°h7! Mo. The
result is a cylindrical cluster catalog in which every clus-
ter is perfectly centered on the most massive halo in the
cylinder.

In addition to the HOD parameters, our cylindrical
cluster catalogs depend on a variety of parameters and as-
sumptions that we do not vary, specifically: 1) the cylin-
der depth d.y1; 2) the concentration—mass relation used
to populate the galaxies in the simulation; 3) the details
of the percolation algorithm; and 4) the fact that the
HOD scatter is assumed to be Poisson. In Appendix A,
we demonstrate that our results are insensitive to these

We have described how to generate synthetic cluster
catalogs with a richness measure Ny, that is similar but
not identical to the redMaPPer richness \. To be able to
relate our simulations to data we need to determine what
the A—~Ncy; relation is. Specifically, our analysis proceeds
as a three-step process:

e Step 1: For each simulation, we use abundance match-
ing to determine the A—Ncy relation that enables us to
exactly reproduce the observed abundances in the data.
The resulting A—Ncy; relation depends on cosmological,
HOD, projection, and miscentering parameters.

e Step 2: For each halo in a simulation, we use the \—
Ny, relation derived in Step 1 to assign a redMaPPer
richness A to simulated halos, and use the simulation to
predict the corresponding weak lensing signal AD(R) for
clusters in a given richness and redshift bin.
e Step 3: With our predictions for AX(R|,) in hand, we
compare our predictions to the DES weak lensing data
at the likelihood level to arrive at the model posteriors.

The next three sections go through each of these three
steps in detail. For readers not interested in the precise
technical details of our work, we recommend skipping
sections IV and V, and reading instead the user-friendly
summary of these sections presented in section VIA.

IV. STEP 1: ABUNDANCE MATCHING
A. The Abundance Matching Framework

In our algorithm so far, the cylindrical clusters are all
perfectly centered. If all redMaPPer clusters were per-
fectly centered, we could readily recover the A—Ney, rela-
tion via abundance matching. That is, we set

MNingios (Neyi) = "Neen (Acen)s (

where Matos (Ney1) is the cumulative halo density in the
simulation, and neen(Acen) is the cumulative cluster den-
sity of perfectly centered clusters in the data. We can
then use Equation 5 to solve for Acen(Neyi). This rela-
tion will enable us to assign a redMaPPer richness to
every halo in a simulation in a way that reproduces the
DES abundance data.

In practice, not every cluster is perfectly centered. To
address this systematic, the necessary first step is to de-
scribe our miscentering model.

on

B. Cluster Miscentering Model

To account for cluster miscentering we rely on the mis-
centering model of Zhang et al. [33]. They found the frac-
tion of miscentered clusters fmis is consistent with being
both redshift and richness independent. Consequently,
fmis is our first miscentering parameter. The miscenter-
ing offset rj; of miscentered clusters is drawn from a
gamma distribution,

P(alr) = exp (-=), (6)

where = rmis/R,, and the parameter 7 represents a
characteristic offset that is richness and redshift inde-
pendent. This is the second miscentering parameter in
the model. Finally, the richness Amis of a miscentered
cluster with an offset rmis is given by

Amis
Acen

~ N (G2), 0y(2))- (7)

The mean and scatter of the richness miscentering cor-
rection are given by

U(x) = exp(—a?/x3), (8)

oy(x) =a x arctan(ba), (9)

on

where again t = rmis/R,. This probability distribution
depends on three parameters, x9, a, and b, for which we
adopt the best-fitting values from the DES-Y1 analysis
in Zhang et al. [33], xo = 1.66 + 0.06, a = 0.26 + 0.04,
and b = 1.43+0.22. Because the miscentering corrections
are small, we anticipate these parameters are measured
accurately enough to have a negligible impact on our re-
sults. Consequently, we hold these parameters fixed, and
verify this expectation a posteriori.

With this miscentering model in hand, we can test the
impact of cluster miscentering on the cluster abundance
function. Specifically, we use our abundance model to
randomly miscenter every redMaPPer cluster, and com-
pare the abundance function n(\) after miscentering to
that before miscentering. The impact on the resulting
abundance functions is < 0.2%, and is therefore entirely
negligible for our purposes. Consequently, we will simply
ignore cluster miscentering for the purposes of construct-
ing the A—N,y, relation via abundance matching. We still
account for the impact of cluster miscentering in the weak
lensing profiles (see below).

C. The —N.y; Relation and Richness Assignments

We use abundance matching (Equation 5) to determine
A(Ney1) for each of our simulations using the empirical
abundance function n(\). The resulting A—~Ny; relation
depends only on cosmology and HOD parameters, but
not on the miscentering parameters. With the \—Neyi
relation in hand, we are finally in a position to assign a
richness \ to every cylinder. If a cluster is well centered,
we simply set \ = A(Ney1). If a cluster is miscentered,
then we randomly draw the miscentering offset ris from
the distribution P(x|r), where x = rmjs/R,, and then
draw the miscentered richness Anis using the distribution
P(mis/Acen|«). We then set \ = Amis. A key feature of
this method is that every halo is igned both a well-
centered richness and a miscentered richness. In the next
section, we describe how we use both of these richness
values to characterize the lensing signal of the galaxy
clusters in our simulations.

V. STEP 2: LENS MODELING

At this point, we have generated training simulations
that sample the space of cosmological and nuisance pa-
rameters. Each simulation has a catalog of “cylindrical
clusters” of richness Ny, which we have mapped to a
centered and miscentered redMaP Per equivalent richness
X using abundance matching. Before evaluating the lens-
ing signal of these clusters we must first account for a
variety of additional complications, specifically: 1) bary-
onic feedback; 2) the impact of cluster miscentering on
their lensing profiles; and 3) the fact that in observa-
tions we do not measure matter densities and projected
distances, but rather shear and angular separations. In

this section, we describe how we calculate the predicted
lensing signal after accounting for each of these effects.

A. Computing Cluster Lensing

We begin by describing how we compute the projected
surface density U(R) of the galaxy clusters in our simula-
tions. We use CORRFUNC [37] to compute the real-space
cluster-matter cross-correlation £¢m(R,7) in 60 equal
logarithmically spaced bins of R covering scales 0.01 <
R <125.0h7! Mpc and 200 equal linearly spaced line-of-
sight distance 7 bins out to Imax = 200.0 h-!Mpe. This
real-space correlation function is converted to the surface
density ¥,

Tax
X(R) = 2pm f dt Eem(R, 7), (10)

which we will convert into the lensing observable AU
after modeling the impact of baryonic feedback and mis-
centering.

B. Baryonic Feedback Model

Baryonic feedback modifies the mass distribution in
the interior of halos. We account for this effect using the
baryonic feedback model of Schneider et al. [38]. Specifi-
cally, we use analytic models to characterize the response
of the halo density profile to baryons, and then apply this
analytic response function to our simulations in order to
“baryonify” our model predictions.

We start with the baryonification framework developed
y Giri and Schneider [39] (also see Schneider et al. [38]).
This framework modifies the matter distribution of halos
y adding a gas component and a central galaxy compo-
nent; satellite galaxies are assumed to trace the dark mat-
er. The model further includes the impact of baryons
on the dark matter profile through adiabatic contraction.
The end result is a 7-parameter model that allows one to
aryonify dark matter only profiles (for a detailed expla-
nation see Appendix B). We will refer to a baryonified
rofile as BCM, for Baryonic Correction Model.

Given an analytic dark matter only halo profile and
a set of baryonification parameters 0, we can use the
methodology of Giri and Schneider [39] to construct
a new baryonified profile pgcom(r|@,m). Our analytic
model for ppmo is the standard halo model expression
of the halo—mass correlation function,

pomo(r|M) = Mu(r|M) + 0(M)&iin(r), (11)
where wu is a unit-normalized NFW profile [40], and b(/)
is the halo bias, which we evaluate using the Tinker et al.
[41] model. After baryonifying this model, we integrate
both the DMO and BCM profiles along the line of sight
to arrive at the projected matter density ©. We then

define the baryon suppression function S(R\0;M) via

Spo (RO; M)
Zpmo(R|M) :

The baryonic suppression function S depends on both
the baryonification parameters @ and the mass M of the
halo. In principle, S can also depend on cosmology, but
since we do not know this dependence a priori, we treat
the baryonification parameters as nuisance parameters
independent of cosmology.

At this point, we seek to perform some amount of di-
mensionality reduction. First, we combine the baryonic
suppression functions across all masses and baryonifica-
tion parameters @, and perform a principal component
analysis. We find that just two principal components
can account for 85% of the total variance. That is, we
can approximate the baryonic suppression function by an
expression of the form

S(r|0;M) = S(r|0)+.A(O, M)ei(r)+C(0, M)eo(r), (13)

S(R|@;M) = (12)

where e; and eg are the first two principal component
vectors. The coefficients A and C' depend on the halo
mass M and the baryonification parameters 0. We find
that we can accurately model the mass dependence of A
and C as polynomials in log mass, i.e.

3
A(@,M) = S> A, (@)(InM)”, (14)
n=0
2
C(@,M) = 9° C,,(0)(uM)”. (15)
n=0

The reason we use “C” as a variable rather than “B” will
be made clear momentarily.

When we plot the various A, and C,, coefficients
against each other, we find that they are linearly related.
That is, we are able to write all coefficients as a determin-
istic function of any one single coefficient. In our case, we
have chosen A3. The specific relations between the vari-
ous coefficients and Ag are collected in Appendix B. For
our purposes, the key fact is that the function A(6|M)
depends only on a single parameter B = A3(0), which we
will refer to as our baryonification variable.

The performance of this simplified baryonification

model is illustrated in Figure 2, where we compare the
baryonic response function as a function of halo mass

for random baryonification parame
best fit prediction using our single

ers 0, along with the
baryonification vari-

FIG. 2. A comparison of Giri and Schneider [39] baryonification models to our one-parameter approximation.

Red and

blue correspond to strong and weak baryonic feedback scenarios. The bands are calculated using the full Giri and Schneider

[39] models, with the width of the band corresponding to the

~ 4% uncertainty of our emulator. The solid lines are the

best-fit models calculated using our dimensionally compressed 1-parameter model, and are fit to all mass bins we consider
simultaneously. Here we only plot the fits for four representative masses. The rms difference between the full model and our

one-parameter fits is ~ 2%.

let M; be the simulated halos within a given richness and
redshift bin. The binned-average baryonic suppression
function Sin takes the form

Viebin 2DMo(R|Mi)S(R|B; Mi)

is |B) =
Sn es con DDwoCRIM,)

(16)

In this formula, both Epmo(R|M;) and S(R|B;M;)
are calculated using our analytic models. Our baryon-
corrected model for the density profile of the galaxy clus-
ters in simulations is given by

Ypom(R|B) = Spin(R|B)E(R), (17)

where © is the projected matter density profile of the
simulated galaxy clusters in the bin (see equation 10).

There is one aspect of baryonification that is not prop-
erly accounted for in our approach. Namely, our bary-
onification procedure is applied only to the most massive
main halo for each cluster system, and not to halos along
the line of sight. Unfortunately, properly accounting for
this effect becomes numerically intractable, though we
also anticipate this effect will have a negligible impact on
our model: small changes to the profiles of the projected
halos have little impact on the projected density profile
of the main halo.

C. Incorporating Cluster Miscentering

Section V B allows us to baryonify the projected matter
density of clusters. We now turn to incorporating cluster
miscentering into our model predictions. If a fraction
fmis of the clusters are miscentered, then the observed
lensing profile is

Ax =(L- fa Abew+ fawAY wes (18)
where fmis is the fraction of miscentered clusters in a
given richness bin, and AY .., and AY pis refer to the
lensing of centered and miscentered clusters, respectively.

Let us focus on evaluating A™ cen first. The lensing sig-
nal of well-centered clusters is related to the baryonified
matter density Upom via

AXcen(R) = (2(< R)) — U(R),
9 pk
=5 dr’ r’Spom — Zpem(R). — (19)
TD 0

The baryonified simulation density profile Ugcm is con-
structed using all galaxy clusters whose well-centered
richness Acen falls within the richness bin of interest.
Our model for AX nis is more complex. First, we select
all simulated clusters whose miscentered richness falls
within the richness bin of interest. We then use the sim-
ulation particles to evaluate the lensing profile Upmo(R)
about the true halo centers. This is necessary in order to
properly account for the impact of baryonification (bary-
onification and miscentering do not commute). We eval-
uate the baryonified profile Ugcm(R) of the galaxy clus-
ters, and then further correct them to account for the
impact of cluster miscentering via

Smis(RIA,2) = | Ar nix P( nisl A) Sani (Blunts, As 2), (20)

where we ignore the mild richness dependence of P(rmis)
with a bin, evaluating the offset distribution at the bin’s
mean richness. We have demonstrated that this as-
sumption has a negligible impact on the resulting lensing
model predictions in Appendix A. In the above expres-
sion, U(R|rmis) is given by

Qn _—

dé F

Sais = [ = Uspeom (Vr +12... — 2Rrmis cos 0) (21)
Jo 20

From here, the miscentered weak lensing profile AU mis
is obtained by using Equation 19, only now we replace
“pom by the miscentered and baryonified profile Umis
calculated using equation 20. With both AX cen and
Amis in hand, we can plug these profiles into Equa-
ion 18 to obtain the weak lensing profile of well-centered
and miscentered galaxy clusters for each richness and red-
shift bin in each of our training simulations.
Note that the lensing profiles are baryonified prior to
miscentering, as they should be. Moreover, cluster selec-
ion for centered and miscentered clusters is done con-
sistently: clusters that contributed to the well-centered
ensing profile of a given bin must have a well-centered
richness in that bin. Likewise, clusters that contributed
o the miscentered lensing profile of a given bin must have
a miscentered richness in that bin. This explains why we
assigned both a well-centered richness and a miscentered
richness to every cluster in our simulations.

D. Cosmology Rescaling

The previous two sections describe how we calculate
A(R) for clusters in a given richness bin. In practice,
however, we do not measure surface density, but shear.
By the same token, we do not measure projected dis-
tance, but rather angular separations. In the DES anal-
ysis, angular separations and shear were transformed into
an excess surface density as a function of radius by adopt-
ing a fiducial flat ACDM cosmology with Q,, = 0.3 and
h = 0.7. Thus, we must first convert AX(R) from each
simulation into a shear profile y(@) using the simulated
cosmology, and then convert this shear profile back into
an excess surface density profile AUgq(Rga) assuming the
DES fiducial cosmology.

The transverse radial separation conversion is straight-
forward: in a flat universe, a comoving separation R
in a cosmology 2 corresponds to a transverse angle
6 = R/x(z|Q), where x(z|Q) is the comoving distance as

a function of redshift in cosmology 2. This angle in turn
corresponds to a transverse separation Rea = x(z|QKa)4
in the fiducial cosmology. Thus, the two scales are related
via

x(2|Q)

R(Raa) =
(Ria) = SC 10;a)

Raa. (22)

We now turn to the lensing amplitude ANga measured
at a given scale. The conversion between shear and excess
surface density profile involves the inverse critical surface
density

where D, and Dg are the angular diameter distance to

given by

and o is the shape noise per galaxy. Taking the expec-
tation value in a cosmological model 2 and assuming a
constant shape noise, we find

AX ga( Rea) = RAX(R(Rea)|Q), (26)

where R is a cosmology-dependent rescale factor given
by

In this expression, ¢(z;) and $(z,) are lens and source
redshift distributions, and (2 refers to the cosmology for
which we are predicting a ANemu. We calculate this
rescaling factor using the DES-Y1 source distributions
estimated using the BPZ algorithm [42] implemented in
Hoyle et al. [15] to evaluate our model predictions for
the observed weak lensing shear signal of the DES galaxy
clusters.

VI. STEP 3: LIKELIHOOD EVALUATION

The previous two sections detailed our simulation-
based framework for evaluating the abundance and weak
lensing signal of redMaPPer galaxy clusters using the
AbacusSummit simulations. Because those sections were
thick in technical detail, we begin this section by offering
a brief high-level summary of our model before detailing

how we use it to constrain cosmological parameters with
the DES redMaPPer data.
A. Modeling Summary

We compute the cluster lensing and abundance for a
single set of cosmology, HOD, miscentering, and baryoni-
fication parameters at a given redshift as follows:

1. Populate halos in the AbacusSummit N-body simula-
tion snapshot of that cosmology according to equations
1 and 2.

2. For each halo, we calculate its HOD galaxy count-in-
cylinder Ney; using the weighting function in equation 3.
We then convert N.-y; into the cluster richness Acen us-
ing abundance matching, i.e., equation 5. The subscript
“cen” indicates this richness has not yet been perturbed
to account for the impact of cluster miscentering.

3. For each halo, we calculate a miscentered value of the
richness Amis based on the assumed characteristic mis-
centering offset parameter 7 and equation 7. In this way,
every cluster is assigned both a well-centered and a mis-
centered richness.

4. To calculate the lensing profile of well-centered clus-
ers, we select all clusters with Acen in the richness bin
of interest. We then use the dark matter particles in the
simulation to arrive at the DMO profile AYpmo(R) in
he simulation. We then perturb this profile using our
compressed version of the Schneider et al. [38] baryoni-
fication model to arrive at the Baryon Corrected Model
rofile AXpcm(R) as per equation 17. This defines the
lensing signal A} .c, of well-centered clusters.

5. To calculate the lensing profile of miscentered clus-
ers, we select all clusters with Ais in the richness bin
of interest. We then use the dark matter particles in the
simulation to arrive at the DMO profile AYpmo(R) in
he simulation. Note that to adequately treat baryonifi-
cation, this lensing profile must be computed about the
tue halo centers. After baryonifying the well-centered
rofile of miscentered clusters, we account for the impact
of miscentering in the weak lensing profile as per equa-
ion 20. The result is AU mis, the weak lensing signal of
miscentered galaxy clusters in the richness bin of interest.

6. Given AX cen and AM pis, the final weak lensing profile
or galaxy clusters in a given richness bin is an appro-
riately weighted linear combination of the two as per
equation 18.

7. The true lensing observable DES redMaPPer clusters
is not AX(R), but rather shear and angular separation.
DES converts these into a fiducial projected distance
Rga and an excess surface density ANga by adopting
a flat ACDM fiducial cosmology with Qn = 0.3 and
h = 0.7. We can evaluate the predicted weak lensing
signal ANga(Rga) based on the excess surface density
profile AX(R) via equation 26.

This process allows us to predict cluster lensing pro-
files for any set of HOD, projection, miscentering, and

baryonification parameters at the cosmology of each of
our simulation boxes.

B. Emulator Design

In practice, the algorithm detailed in section VIA is
much too cumbersome to use for parameter inference.
Consequently, we use this process to generate a set of
model data vectors to train an emulator that enables cos-
mological parameter inference.

We construct our emulator with a training set gener-
ated by a Latin hypercube sampling of the flat priors
on our HOD, baryonification parameter B, and miscen-
tering parameter 7 (see Table I). We generate 106 such
samples, and assign 2 of these parameterizations without
replacement to each of our 53 cosmologies. We then use
the algorithm summarized in Section VIA to compute
the predicted lensing signal AUga(Rga) for each of these
simulations. The data vector AXga(Rga) is defined us-
ing the same richness, redshift, and radial bins employed
in the real data. We treat each element in this data
vector as independent of the rest, and use Gaussian pro-
cesses to interpolate across our full parameter space on
an element-by-element basis.

To account for redshift evolution across the survey,
the emulator for each redshift bin is constructed us-
ing a different snapshot from the AbacusSummit sim-
ulations. We use the z = 0.3 snapshot to build the
z € [0.2,0.35] emulator, the z = 0.4 snapshot to build
the z € [0.35,0.5] emulator, and the z = 0.5 snapshot
so build the z € [0.5,0.65] emulator. In Salcedo et al.
[11] we demonstrated that the fact that these snapshots
do not exactly coincide with the mean/median redshift
of each bin results in negligible systematic uncertainties,
even for the case of our highest redshift bin.

To improve the accuracy of our emulator, after run-
ning a first analysis using the emulator described above,
we sample an additional set of 106 HOD and nuisance pa-
rameters from the posteriors, and use these to augment
the initial 106 training simulations.

Figure 3 illustrates the accuracy of our final emula-
tor. The top panel shows our data vector (points with
error bars in the lowest redshift bin (z € [0.20,0.35))
compared to our training set (light lines). Bottom pan-
els show the fractional leave-one-out error (dashed lines)
relative to the observable covariance (bands). Note that
our “leave one out” test removes one N-body simulation,
corresponding to four distinct training samples. The final
systematic uncertainty in the emulator profiles is < 4%,
compared to the 10—20% errors in the data. This addi-
tional uncertainty is included in the final covariance used
for inference by adding it in quadrature with the analyt-
ically estimated covariance described in Section VIC.

and lo errors, respectively.

C. Gaussian likelihood model

Because the abundance data is used to determine the
A-Neyi relation, the data vector in our likelihood is re-
stricted to the observed weak lensing profile AXops (Raa)
in richness and redshift bins.

To constrain our model parameters, we assume a Gaus-

and A = AXemu — AX obs is the difference between emu-
lated and measured observable cluster lensing, and C’ is
the lensing covariance matrix. We compute these covari-
ance matrices using the Gaussian formalism presented in

where fsxy is the DES-Y1 fraction of the sky, Jy are radi-
ally bin averaged Bessel functions of the second kind, Cf°,
CP™ and C® are the cluster-cluster, projected matter-
matter and cluster-projected matter angular power spec-
tra, no~ and n2P are the surface number density of clus-
ters and source galaxies respectively, and 7 is the DES-
Y1 shape noise per source galaxy. For each redshift and
richness bin we compute relevant cluster power spectra
using the Tinker et al. [41] bias of the relevant mean
mass calibrated by McClintock et al. [17]. The covariance
matrix is non-diagonal across radial bins, but different
richness bins are assumed to be uncorrelated. This is a
reasonable approximation because the errors are shape-
noise-dominated. We refer the reader to Wu et al. [43] for
further details. We then rescale each of our covariances
so that their diagonal elements agree with the variance
estimated from jackknife on the data. This rescaling is
typically 10 — 20%, but is unusually large for our highest
richness and redshift bin, reaching a factor of two. Our
results are negligibly impacted by dropping this bin. For
instance, the change in our best fit Sg parameter is 0.10,
while the error bar changes by only 3%.
The model predictions for AD are taken directly from
the emulator described in the previous section. We em-
ulate the centered and miscentered lensing profiles inde-
pendently and calculate the final lensing profile via

AXemu = AmR [fmisADBS, + (1 — fmis) AZS2,] ,(30)

where fmis is the fraction of miscentered clusters, AUSS,

and Ave", are the miscentered and centered lensing em-
ulator predictions, and A,, accounts for a possible modu-
lation of the weak lensing signal due to shear calibration
and source photometric redshift uncertainties [17]. We
implement linear redshift evolution of our HOD parame-
ters in our likelihood analysis by parameterizing each of
our HOD parameters (i.e., log M; log Min, log Mzo and
a) separately in our lowest and highest cluster redshift
bins, and assume a linear evolution in redshift between
the two to predict the value of these parameters in the
middle redshift bin.

N (0.02208, 0.00052) defined in Abbott et al. [44] based on
Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraints [45]. As noted ear-
lier, in some cases we also impose a top-hat prior within
the multi-dimensional ellipsoid from which the Abacus-
Summit simulation cosmologies are drawn. We sample
our parameter posteriors using the affine invariant ensem-
ble Markoy-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampler imple-
mented in EMCEE Python package [46].

VII. RESULTS
A. Fiducial results and systematics tests

We use the abundance and lensing signal of DES-Y1
redMaPPer clusters in six richness bins and three red-
shift bins to derive cosmological constraints. The sample
includes all clusters with richness A > 10 and spanning
he redshift range z = 0.20—0.65. To model this data we
employ the simulation-based framework described in Sec-
ions III-V and summarized in Section VIA. Our Gaus-
sian likelihood model relies on analytically estimated co-
variance matrices that are rescaled to match Jackknife
estimates of the data, as described in detail in VIC. Our
analysis holds the spectral index of the primordial matter
fluctuations fixed to 0.9649, and the effective number of
relativistic species today to Ny, = 2.0328, as appropriate
‘or one massive neutrino species of minimal mass.? We
do not allow for running of the spectral index, and we fix

sity as the Nog = 3.046 value for massless neutrinos.

the dark energy equation of state to w = —1. Our pri-
mary goal is to set constraints on gg and Qm, which are
the two cosmological parameters with the largest impact
on cluster weak lensing profiles. For further details, see
Table I.
Figure 4 compares the DES weak lensing data to the
weak lensing profiles obtained by sampling our model
posterior when imposing the AbacusSummit prior — i.e.,
a conservative CMB+LSS prior circa 2021, as described
in Sec. IIB. Our best-fit model adequately describes the
data with a y?/dof = 190.51/188 and a corresponding
probability-to-exceed value of 0.435. This best-fitting
point lies comfortably within the AbacusSummit prior.
Figure 5 shows our marginalized constraints with (red)
and without (orange) the AbacusSummit prior (gray) in
the Qm—cg plane. We can see that while the run without
the AbacusSummit prior extends past it, thereby requir-
ing some amount of model extrapolation, the posterior
volume that requires extrapolation is small: ~10% of the
points in our chain fall outside the AbacusSummit prior.
In Appendix C, we present tests that further suggest that
this limited extrapolation does not significantly impact
our results.
Figure 5 also compares our posteriors to those from
Planck CMB measurements [purple; 23], the DES-Y1
3x2 [green; 47], and the original DES-Y1 cluster lens-
ing and abundance analysis [blue; 3]. Compared to the
original DES-Y1 cluster analysis in Abbott et al. [3], our
constraints are significantly shifted to higher Qy,. This is
not simply due to the AbacusSummit prior: as demon-
strated in Salcedo et al. [11], our simulation framework
results in acceptable fits to the lensing data for a Planck
cosmology, whereas the original model from [3] exhibits
a much larger x? (Ay? = 39.91). Additionally, Figure 4
shows that our best fit is well within the AbacusSum-
mit sampling region, and that it provides an excellent
description of the data.
Following Lemos et al. [48] we calculate the relative x?

cluster constraints with those from DES-Y1 3 x 2 is shown in black.

between two posteriors A and B as

x? = (Ba — De)’ (Cova + Covg)'(p4—-Pp), (31)

where p'4 and pg are the (Qm, og) values from posterior
A and B respectively, and Cov, and Cov g are the corre-
sponding 2 x 2 posterior parameter covariance matrices.
We then convert this ? into a probability to exceed value
and report the corresponding tension in units of o.

Using our runs without an AbacusSummit prior, we
find our constraints are in 2.580 tension with Planck,
and in 2.860 tension with the combined CMB-primaries
from Planck, ACT, and SPT [49]. Note the tension with
Planck is much reduced from the 5.60 tension reported
in [3] despite the fact that our results are significantly
more precise. Our posteriors are now also comfortably
consistent with the DES-Y1 3x 2-point analysis. We com-
pare to DES-Y3 results below, but the juxtaposition here
shows that cluster constraints are similar in precision to
he 3 x 2 constraints using the same weak lensing data
set.

Our constraints on key cosmological parameters when
we do not impose the AbacusSummit prior are
= +0.026
Om, = 0.2547 9.920;
:+0.030
08 = 0.82679 0345

_ +0.020
Sg = 0.75949.020,

(32)

These constraints are marginalized over all HOD, mis-
centering, and baryonification parameters. If we do im-
pose the AbacusSummit prior we find Sg = 0.760*0:0%8,
which is indeed nearly identical to the posterior obtained
without the prior. For Qm, the AbacusSummit prior is
informative because values below ~ 0.23 are not allowed.
From here onward we concentrate on results without the
AbacusSummit prior, as we consider these a more accu-
rate representation of the cluster constraints.

Because our cluster lensing data vector is shape-noise
dominated while the DES-Y1 3 x 2 data vector is sample
variance dominated, the two probes are approximately

independent. We therefore combine* the two analyses,
finding

Qin 026679 017,
og = 0.81549-026, (33)

Sg = 0.767+0-015,

These constraints are shown in Figure 5 as black con-
tours. They are in 2.990 tension with Planck and 3.470
with the combination of Planck, SPT, and ACT CMB
primaries [49]. We note that after combining with DES
Y1 3x2-point data, only 0.7% of the posterior falls out-
side of the AbacusSummit prior.

B. Robustness Tests

We assess the robustness of our constraints by splitting
our data vector into different disjoint subsamples as de-
scribed below. Because the posteriors from these subsets
are less constraining, and would therefore require larger
extrapolations, our robustness tests are performed with
respect to the parameter combination

Dg = 08(Qm/0.3)? (34)

that is best constrained by the data.
The data splits we consider are:

e Richness splits: We split the six richness bins into three
subsets, each with two richness bins, and derive cosmo-
logical constraints using those bins only.

e Redshift splits: We derive cosmological constraints us-
ing only one redshift bin at a time.

e Scales splits: We derive cosmological constraints by
restricting our analysis to scales either below or above a
radial threshold of R = 2 h~! Mpc.

Finally, we also test whether the evolution model impacts
our posteriors by treating the HOD parameters in each
of the three redshift bins as being independent of one an-
other. The resulting Ug posteriors are shown in Figure 6
‘or cases with (orange) and without (red) the Abacus-
Summit prior imposed. We see that the Ug posteriors
are consistent across all samples, demonstrating the ro-
bustness of our results. One possible source of concern
is that Ng increases monotonically as we go from the low
richness bins to the high richness bins. However, it is not
obvious that this trend is significant: the three richness
bins are independent random draws, in which case one
naively expects a probability of 1/3 for the middle bin to
‘all between bins | and 3.

software package [50].

We now compare our constraints on Q, and og to those
from a variety of cosmological probes of late-time matter
clustering. These comparisons are summarized in Fig-
ure 7. The orange contours represent the 68% and 95%
confidence levels as obtained without the AbacusSummit
prior.

In the top-left panel of Figure 7 we compare our re-
sults to those from other recent optical cluster studies,
namely the DES-Y3 4x2pt+N analysis of [potherurple;
51], the KiDS-1000 analysis of AMICO-selected cluster
abundances and lensing [brown; 52], and the analysis
of SDSS redMaPPer cluster abundances and clustering
with HSC lensing from [light blue; 53]. We note that
4x2pt+N refers to the combination of large-scale cluster-
shear, cluster-galaxy, cluster-cluster, and galaxy-galaxy
correlations with cluster abundances (the “N”).

There is broad agreement between the various optical
cluster analyses, though we note the KiDS-1000 contour

results in surprisingly low matter densities that are in
strong tension with the CMB. We anticipate that this
behavior has a similar origin to that of the original DES-
Y1 analysis of Abbott et al. [3]. In particular, while the
KiDS-1000 analysis is restricted to relatively small scales
(rp < 3h! Mpc), we find that the impact of cluster se-
lection in redMaPPer is non-negligible even within the
1-halo term (e.g., right-panel of Fig. 2 in Salcedo et al.

[54]).>

Compared to these other optical cluster cosmology
constraints, our results are more precise due to a va-
riety of differences in methodology. Specifically, our

simulation-based framework enables us to reach lower
richness thresholds, which increases constraining power.
Moreover, our pipeline accounts for the cosmology de-
endence of cluster selection effects while reducing the
number of model parameters that significantly impact
cluster lensing, leading to improved statistical precision.
Together, these effects enable us to achieve tight cosmo-
logical constraints.

In the top right panel of Figure 7 we compare our re-
sults to constraints from X-ray and SZ cluster abundance
studies: the analysis of SZ-selected clusters in SPT cali-
rated with DES and HSC lensing [olive; 55], the analy-
sis of X-ray clusters in the first eEROSITA all sky survey
(eRASS1) calibrated with DES, HSC, and KiDS lens-
ing [pink; 56], and the analysis of X-ray clusters in the
eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS) cali-
rated with HSC lensing [dark cyan; 57]. Our constraints
from DES-Y1 optical clusters are competitive in precision
with those from the X-ray and SZ samples. We find good
agreement between our constraints and those from SPT
and eFEDS clusters, and a significant 4.10 tension with
results from X-ray clusters in the eRASS1. The tension
etween the two eROSITA datasets is 2.00. These ten-
sions are driven primarily by the eRASS1 data’s prefer-
ence for a high og. The exact source of this discrepancy
is unclear, though Ghirardini et al. [56] show that their
constraints can be impacted by the precise mass function
hey assume. Their fiducial analysis assumes the mass
function parameterization of [58], but they show that as-
suming the parameterizations of either [59] or [60] shifts
heir constraints to lower og, substantially reducing the
ension with our work.

We next turn to comparisons with constraints from
he combination of cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing,
and galaxy clustering, typically referred to as 3 x 2. The
ottom left panel in Figure 7 compares our constraints
with 3 x 2. from DES-Y3 [green; 65], KiDS-1000 [blue;
66] and HSC-Y3 [gold; 67]. We can see our constraints
are both in agreement with and of comparable precision
‘o those from Stage-III 3x 2-pt analyses.

The bottom right panel of Figure 7 compares our
constraints with several full-shape spectroscopic galaxy
clustering analyses, namely DESI-DR1 [dark pink; 68],
he effective field theory based analysis of the BOSS
galaxy power-spectrum and bispectrum of [light green
69], the redshift-space galaxy clustering analysis from
he BACCO team [gray; 9], and the DarkEmulator based
analysis of the BOSS redshift-space galaxy clustering [or-
ange; 10]. We find we are in good agreement with these
ull-shape clustering analyses, with the exception of a
2.40 tension with [69] due to our preference for a lower
matter density, and their preference for a lower og.

We further compare our results against cosmological
constraints derived using CMB secondaries, as illustrated
in Figure 8. The analyses we consider are the extension
of the DES-Y1 3x2-pt analysis to cross-correlations with
CMB secondaries [light green; 61], this same extension
for DES-Y3 [red; 62], the combination of DES-Y3 cos-

also achieving comparable precision.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a novel simulation-based forward-
modeling framework for analyzing cluster abundance and
weak-lensing data. Our approach explicitly incorporates
the cosmology-dependent impact of projection effects in
galaxy clustering while still enabling us to marginalize
over cluster miscentering and baryonic effects. We have
applied this framework to redMaPPer clusters selected in
DES-Y1 data and show that our methodology success-
fully describes the lensing profiles of these clusters down
to small scales (0.2h~! Mpc) and low richness (A = 10),
with a goodness-of-fit metric of y?/dof = 190.51/188.

From this analysis, we obtain constraints on the cos-
mological matter content and clustering: Qm = 0.254 +
0.023, og = 0.826 + 0.032, and Sg = 0.758 + 0.20. About

10% of the points in our MCMC chain lie in a region of
parameter space not covered by the AbacusSummit sim-
ulations used to train our emulator, extending to lower
values of Qm. However, imposing a prior that eliminates
models outside the AbacusSummit range has only a small
impact on our parameter estimates. When combining
our cluster constraints with DES-Y1 3 x 2 constraints
we obtain Q,, = 0.266 + 0.016, og = 0.815 + 0.025, and
Sg = 0.768 + 0.15. These combined results require negli-
gible model extrapolation, with ~ 99.3% of the points in
the chain contained within the AbacusSummit prior.
Our constraints from DES-Y1 clusters are competitive
in precision and in mostly good agreement with litera-
ture constraints from other low-redshift growth probes,
including Stage III 3x2-pt analyses, full-shape spectro-
scopic clustering constraints, and CMB-secondaries as
summarized in Figures 7 and 8. Compared to other opti-
cal cluster cosmology analyses, our results are more pre-
cise. This is partly due to the inclusion of information
from small scales and low richness, and partly because
our forward modeling framework characterizes the cos-
mology dependence of cluster projection effects while re-
ducing the number of free parameters that significantly
impact the predicted weak lensing signal.
Our constraints agree with those from SZ clusters,
weak lensing, and full-shape galaxy clustering. They dis-
agree (at 4.10) with those from [56] based on X-ray clus-
ters from eRASS1, which imply significantly higher og at
a given 2,,. In contrast, we find our constraints to be in
agreement with eFEDS X-ray clusters, which are them-
selves in 2.00 tension with X-ray clusters in eRASS1.
The source of these discrepancies is currently unclear.
Despite the complications of projection effects, we con-
sider our analysis of optically selected clusters to be as
robust as those from SZ and X-ray clusters because our
simulation tests show that we can model optical selec-
tion directly. Critically, this modeling of selection re-
moves mass-observable scatter as an adjustable param-
eter degenerate with cosmological parameters (see Wu
et al. [70]).
Compared to the original DES-Y1 cluster analysis of
Abbott et al. [3], our results are much closer to those of a
Planck-normalized ACDM cosmology, with the difference
being significant at 2.580 rather than 5.60. The signifi-
cance of the difference between our results and the com-
bined Planck, SPT, and ACT primaries is 2.860. In the
panoply of low redshift matter clustering constraints from

weak lensing and redshift-space distortions, our measure-
ment leans towards lower values of Qm and Sj.

Our results demonstrate that the forward-modeling
framework presented in this paper is capable of robustly
characterizing optical cluster selection to enable precise
and accurate cosmological analyses from optical cluster
samples. The derived constraints are competitive and
consistent with a wide field of low-redshift probes of
arge-scale structure. Moving forward, we aim to im-
prove the fidelity of our forward-modeling framework,
both through improved modeling of the galaxy popu-
ation, and by modifying the cluster finding process to
make it easier to emulate. Application of this type of im-
proved analyses to more recent DES data and upcoming
LSST, Roman, and Euclid will enable us to deliver on
he promise of the use of optical galaxy clusters as a tool
for precision cosmology in the Stage IV era.

We show how our model predictions for low and

high richness lensing responds to variations in our fiducial
HOD and cylinder selection assumptions. Red and blue lines
show variations in the assumed concentration-mass relation,
purple and yellow show variations in the assumed depth of the
cylinder selection, the green line shows the impact of allowing
for super-poissonian scatter in the satellite occupation, the
orange line shows the impact of raising our cylinder selection
percolation threshold to 25%, and the brown line shows the
impact of evaluating our miscentering model at each bin’s
minimum rather than mean richness.

Appendix A: Robustness to Selection Choices

In Sections HI we identify a variety of simplifying as-
sumptions made in our HOD modeling and mock cluster
selection algorithm, specifically: 1) we fix the cylinder
depth o, in each redshift bin to the width of redshift ker-
nel measured using the method of Costanzi et al. [75]; 2)
we assume a fixed concentration-mass relation; 3) we as-
sume that the scatter in the satellite occupation is purely
Poisson; 4) we adopt a fixed threshold for percolation in
our cluster selection algorithm; and 5) we evaluate the
miscentering offset distribution in equation 20 at each
richness bin’s mean richness.

Most of these assumptions are well motivated: 1) in
Salcedo et al. [11] we find dy; to be poorly constrained
oy cluster lensing, 2) we the impact of variations in the
concentration-mass relation to be most important well
within the aperture for optical cluster selection, 3) we
find in Salcedo et al. [11] a lack of evidence for super-
poissonian scatter from cluster lensing.

In Figure 9 we further validate our insensitivity to
hese choices. We plot our fiducial model with associ-
ated lo errors in gray bands for the highest and lowest
richness bins at z € [0.2,0.35). We compare these model
redictions with: 1) variations in the concentration-mass
relation where the galaxy concentration

CF = Aon x 0", (Al)

is allowed to vary by +25% (red/blue) relative to that
of the matter; 2) +25% variations in the cylinder pro-
jection depth o, (purple/yellow); 3) a case where we in-
clude additional lognormal scatter of cin, = 0.2 in the
satellite occupation (green); 4) a case in which we raise
the percolation threshold to 25% (orange); and 5) a case
where we evaluate our miscentering model in each bin
assuming the richness bin’s minimum rather than mean
richness (brown). In all cases we find our lensing signal
prediction to change by much less than the associated
statistical uncertainties.

Appendix B: Baryonification

Following [39] we model a “baryonified” halo profile as,

Pamb(T) = Peim(7) + Pgas(T) + Pega(T); (B1)
asum of collisionless matter (clm), gas (gas), and central
galaxy (cga) profiles. These density profiles are normal-
ized such that,

Appendix C: Emulator Extrapolation Tests

In Section VII we present fiducial results with and
without the inclusion of the AbacusSummit prior, which
is meant to be a conservative (~ 6—8c) estimate of the
posteriors from CMB+LSS circa 2021. In either case our
best-fit parameters lie comfortably within this sampling
range. However when we do not impose this prior our
sampling extends beyond the AbacusSummit sampling
range, and therefore requires some amount of model ex-
trapolation. We find ~ 11% of the points in our chain
with no AbacusSummit prior require extrapolation. This
extrapolation is not strictly confined to a simple parame-
ter but is most significant in terms of Q. Points outside
of the sampling range lay within the range of values of og
supported by AbacusSummit but extend to lower 2,,.

To test the impact of this extrapolation on our results
we define two subsets of our simulation suite, the 15 sim-
ulations with Qn < 0.3 and a separate set of 15 randomly
selected simulations. We retrain our emulator with each
individual subset of the simulation suite removed. For
each of these sets we also compute our lensing datavec-
tor at a fiducial HOD model lying at the center of our
emulation ranges. We make this choice because we are

interested in specifically testing the impact of extrapola-
tion in our cosmology parameters, and because the HOD
parameters dominate the inaccuracy in our full emulator.

Figure 10 shows the accuracy with which each re-
trained emulator predicts the lensing signal of the omit-
ted simulations in our lowest redshift bin z € [0.20, 0.35).
In each column, different panels show the fractional ac-
curacy of a different richness bin. The solid lines shows
the mean bias, dashed lines show the mean dispersion,
and colored bands show the fractional uncertainty from
our observable covariance. The left-hand column shows
the accuracy with which the emulator trained on all sim-
ulations with Qm > 0.3 can predict the lensing of those
simulations with Qn < 0.30, and the right-hand column
shows the accuracy that the emulator trained without
a random subset of cosmologies can predict the lensing
signal of those cosmologies. We see that in both cases
our emulator prediction is accurate relative to the un-
certainty in DES-Y1, and that performance of the two
emulators is reasonably consistent. This suggests that
limited extrapolation below Qm * 0.25 does not signifi-
cantly impact our results. We have also carried out this
test with the lensing profiles for the other two redshift
bins, finding comparable results (not shown).
