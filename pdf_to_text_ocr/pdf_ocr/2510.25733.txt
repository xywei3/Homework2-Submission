ABSTRACT: In this paper we investigate the loop-level geometry of ABJM theory from the
perspective of lightcone geometries in dual space. This geometry admits a natural fibration,
where one of the loop variables can be naturally interpreted as living in a fiber for each fixed
point of a lower-loop geometry. When varying the latter, this leads us to the definition of
L-loop half-chambers, defined such that ‘half’ of the (Z + 1)-loop fiber remains unchanged.
We provide a full classification of these half-chambers, and demonstrate a surprising bijection
between n-point L-loop half-chambers and L-loop Feynman diagrams for a cubic scalar the-
ory with n/2 particles. Consequently, the sum over L-loop half-chambers that computes the
n-point ABJM amplitude is in direct correspondence with the sum over L-loop Feynman dia-
grams that computes the (n/2)-point amplitude of Tr(¢?) theory. These Feynman diagrams
are also realised geometrically in the structure of the loop fibers. Furthermore, we argue
that the half-chamber expansion is equivalent to the loop-level BCFW recursion for ABJM,
which arises naturally from our geometric construction. Finally, we will illustrate how L-loop
chambers emerge as the intersection of two L-loop half-chambers, and we provide concrete

examples of this construction.

1 Introduction

Over the past decade, we have learned that scattering amplitudes can be understood as
the canonical differential form of certain positive geometries [1]. This idea, first realised
for planar NM = 4 SYM through the amplituhedron [2-6], has since been extended to a
variety of theories, including Tr ¢°) via the ABHY associahedron [7] and ABJM theory
via the ABJM amplituhedron [8, 9]. The positive geometry framework now encompasses a
wide range of observables, such as correlation functions [10] and cosmological wavefunctions
[11, 12], illustrating its broader applicability.

In this work, we explore the loop-level geometry of ABJM theory from the perspective
of lightcone geometries in dual space. The complexity of the ABJM amplituhedron grows

rapidly with both particle number and loop order, making direct computation of its canon-
ical form intractable beyond the simplest of cases. This motivates the development of new
techniques that decompose the amplituhedron into simpler pieces whose canonical forms are
easier to determine. The most famous decomposition is given by the BCFW recursion rela-
tions, which provide us with an all-loop formula for the canonical form 2. [oe] of the ABJM
amplituhedron. For example, at six-points one-loop the BCFW recursion yields a sum over
four on-shell diagrams given diagrammatically by

Q[os”) XK “DB v wt (1.1)

Recently, a complementary fibration based approach has emerged, naturally formulated in

dual momentum space [13-16]. In its original formulation, the idea behind fibrations is the
ollowing. Each point in the tree-level geometry defines a null-polygon x = (,..., 2%)
in dual space, and the lightcones of the cusps x; bound some compact region A(x). The
oop integrand structure of ABJM is then captured geometrically by the space of L points
Y1,--+;Yz) inside A(x) which are additionally required to be mutually spacelike separated.
As proposed in [9], by decomposing the tree-level kinematic space into chambers for which
1e combinatorial structure of the loop geometry remains constant, the tree-level and loop-
evel data effectively decouple. This leads to a factorisation of the canonical form into two
components: a tree-level piece—the chambers—whose collection tiles the tree-level kinematic

space, and a corresponding loop-level factor—the fibers—which encode the loop geometry.
In this way, the full geometry can be viewed as a fibration of the loop geometry over the
ree-level chambers.

The aim of this paper is to establish a direct connection between the fibration picture and
1e BCFW recursion for ABJM loop integrands. In contrast to [9], in which the loop geometry

is fibrated over tree-level, we consider fibrations of a single loop variable yz +1 over the L-loop
geometry. Specifically, given a point in the L-loop amplituhedron, we define the (Z + 1)-loop
fiber as the lightcone geometry associated to one additional loop variable yz41. In particular,

he vertices of this loop-fiber are located at the intersection of three lightcones, associated to

either the cusps of the null-polygon or the preceding loop momenta, and can be classified as
either future or past vertices. It is then natural to triangulate the L-loop amplituhedron into
regions for which the set of future or past vertices of the (Z + 1)-loop fiber remain constant.
We refer to these regions of the L-loop amplituhedron as half-chambers'.

We find that the L-loop half-chambers for 2k-particle scattering are naturally labelled
by k-particle, Z-loop cubic scalar Feynman diagrams, or dually, by triangulations of an L-
punctured k-gon. These diagrams are realised geometrically as the skeletal structure of the
(ZL + 1)-loop fiber. This is an extension of the results of [13], where a similar phenomenon
was observed at tree-level. Since the half-chambers tile the full L-loop geometry, we arrive
at the result that ABJM integrands can be computed by summing over all (tadpole-less)
triangulations of an L-punctured k-gon. An example of the half-chamber expansion of the
six-point one-loop integrand is given diagrammatically by

atos= W/ WV + WZ + W (1.2)

Comparing this to (1.1) we see that the terms in the half-chamber expansion are in bijection
with the terms in the BCFW expansion. In fact, we will argue that the L-loop half-chamber
expansion is equivalent to the L-loop BCFW recursion for ABJM integrands [17]. It is remark-
able that a simple question about the combinatorial structure of loop fibers naturally gives
rise to the BCFW decomposition of the ABJM amplituhedron. Moreover, this correspondence
provides a direct geometric interpretation of these recursion relations.

The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we review the basic
kinematic facts relevant for studying ABJM integrands in dual space. In section 3 we detail
he construction of the ABJM momentum amplituhedron at tree-level, and the loop-level
ightcone geometries. This includes an introduction to the chambers and fibers construction.
In section 4 and 5 we present the main results of this paper, a detailed discussion of half-
chambers and their connection to the BCFW recursion relations. Specifically, we establish
hat L-loop half-chambers have a natural labelling inherited from the structure of the (L +

)-loop fiber in terms of triangulations of an L-punctured polygon. Moreover, we show a
diagrammatic correspondence between the BCFW recursion relations and the L-loop Berends-
Giele recursion for cubic scalar Feynman diagrams. In section 6 we give a brief discussion of
full L-loop chambers, which arise as the intersection of two L-loop half-chambers. Finally, we
conclude with a summary and outlook to some open problems in section 7.

2 Kinematics

We will be working in three-dimensional Minkowski space R!? with signature (—, +, +) such
that the distance between two points x and y is given by

(w@-y) =—(a' -y)? +(e? — P+ (a — y?)?. (2.1)

"We refer to these as half-chambers as they fix exactly half of the vertices of the fiber.
Given a point « € R!? we can split Minkowski space into points which are null separated,
positively separated (space-like) and negatively separated (time-like) from x for which we use
the notation

Na ={y eR” | (y— 2)? = 0},

Noi = {y eR! | (y—2)? > 0},

Nz :={y ER? | (y—2)? < 0}. (2.2)
The scattering data for n-point amplitudes in ABJM theory is given by a set of n = 2k three-
dimensional momenta ph, a = 1,...,2k, = 0,1,2, subject to momentum conservation and

the massless on-shell condition p? = 0. By convention, we choose all particles with odd/even
labels to be outgoing/incoming, respectively, such that momentum conservation is given by

YU m= SS we. (2.3)
aéodd aceven
Since we will be dealing with the planar theory, the scattering data can alternatively be

encoded using dual momentum coordinates x defined as

pte pl! a

ph = aby, — af. (2.4)
Through this relation the scattering data specifies a polygon in Minkowski space with vertices
x := (1,..., 2) whose consecutive vertices zq and 241 are null separated. The definition
of the dual momentum coordinates is invariant under a global translation and it is convenient
to make the choice x; = 0 allowing us to invert relation (2.3) to find

A concept which will play an important role when coming to study the structure of the ABJM
momentum amplituhedron is the notion of triple-cut points. Given three points x;, x; and
tp, there generically exist two points des which we refer to as triple cut points, satisfying
the triple-cut conditions

The sign in the superscript of these triple intersections is determined by the orientation of
the tetrahedron with corners (2;,2;, ©, in):

As is familiar from its four-dimensional counterpart, the massless on-shell condition,
p? = 0, can be resolved via the introduction of three-dimensional spinor-helicity variables as

0! sp? 1 ;
ph _ eo ey y |= Neve, (2.7)
Pp —Pp —Pp

In the spinor-helicity formalism the following Lorentz invariant brackets appear frequently

(ab) = ALAR — AZ Ag. (2.8)
3 The ABJM momentum amplituhedron

The tree-level ABJM momentum amplituhedron O, is a (2k — 3)-dimensional geometry in 3D
spinor-helicity space which encodes (n = 2k)-particle scattering in ABJM theory at tree level
[6, 18]. A point A € O, is defined to satisfy

(it + 1) >0,  Siiti...3 > 0, (3.1)
{(12), (13),...,(1n)} has k sign-flips, (3.2)

where we define the planar Mandelstam variables as

sig = D> (-1ett(ab)?. (3.3)
i<a<b<j
Translating into dual space, a point \ € O; defines a null-polygon x := (af ,...,ah) by making

use of equations (2.7) and (2.5). The positivity of the planar Mandelstam variables is now
equivalent to the statement that sij+1...j-1 = (xi — xj)? >0,Vi,j.

To generalise the ABJM momentum amplituhedron to loop level, we consider the space
of points which are space-like separated from all points x; in a null-polygon generated by
a point in O,. As observed in [13] the space Nj... splits up into two parts: a
non-compact part which extends out to space-like infinity, and a compact part ‘inside’ the
null-polygon. The compactness condition is equivalent to the sign-flip condition of [9]. We
will be interested in this compact part, which we denote by

A(x) = {y € R' | (y—2;)? > 0, compact}. (3.4)

We refer to A(x) as the one-loop fiber, for reasons that will become clear shortly. Examples
of one-loop fibers for n = 4 and n = 6 are depicted in Fig. 1.

To extend to all loops, we define

AM (x) = {(yr.yo,---. yt) € (AC))* | (yi yy)? 20 Vij =1,2,...,L}. (3.5)
Then the L-loop ABJM momentum amplituhedron is defined as

Of? = {QAM (x) | A€ On}, (3.6)
and its canonical form Qo”) computes the L-loop integrand in ABJM theory. Here we use
the notation x) to indicate the null-polygon which is generated by X.

3.1 Chambers and fibers

In this section we review the ‘chambers and fibrations’ construction which was recently in-
troduced to study positive geometries. The key idea is to consider a map which projects
out degrees of freedom from a certain geometry. The preimage of this projection map is
what is called fiber. By studying how the mathematical description of the fibers changes, we
are naturally led to a decomposition of the image of this projection into a finite number of
chambers. The full geometry is then reconstructed as L); ¢; x fi, where the union is over all
chambers c; and their associated fibers f;. This framework has been utilised successfully for
loop integrands in ABJM in [9, 13] and for NV = 4 SYM in [14, 15], and has been used at
tree-level for Tr(¢*) and the inverse KLT kernel in [19]. See (20, 21] for similar progress for
correlation functions.

In our context, at one-loop, the combinatorial structure of the one-loop fiber A(x) can
change as we allow the null-polygon x to vary. This leads us to the definition of the tree-

level chambers as subsets of the tree-level ABJM momentum amplituhedron for which the
combinatorial structure of the one-loop fiber A(x) remains constant. Here, the combinatorial
structure essentially refers to the skeleton of the geometry. That is, we care about which
vertices are part of the geometry, how they are connected via edges, and on which facets
they lie, but the explicit coordinates of these vertices are not important. An example of this
construction is displayed for eight-points in Fig. 2. In this case, the tree-level kinematic

space is divided into four chambers. The blue lines in each figure encode the one-skeleton of
the one-loop fiber. We will return to the full classification of the tree-level chambers in the
following section.

To study higher-loop integrands, a number of different approaches has been taken. The
most direct is to consider a fibration of the full 3L-dimensional loop structure over the tree-
level [9]. This splits the tree-level space into chambers which are further and further refined
as the loop level increases. We explain this refinement from the perspective of lightcone
geometries in appendix A. In contrast, [15, 16] preferred an approach where each loop variable
is iteratively seen as a fibration over the previous loop variable, creating a stack of ‘fibrations
of fibrations’. While successfully implemented to compute the two-loop MHV momentum
amplituhedron form, and the MHV ladder geometries for all n, applying this technique naively
appears to break down at higher loops/helicity. We comment on this phenomenon more fully
in the conclusions.

In this paper we favour yet another approach, where we fibrate the (L + 1)** loop variable
over the L-loop ABJM momentum amplituhedron. More precisely, we define the (L + 1)-loop

fiber as the space
A(xiy1,---9e) = {urn € A(X) | Yous — i)? S0, 7=1,...,L}. (3.7)

Furthermore, we define the L-loop chamber as a subset of ol) for which the combinatorial
structure of the (L + 1)-loop fiber A(x; y1,...,yz) remains constant. The reason for this
choice is to make a close connection to the BCFW recursion relations, which act one loop at

atime. We will return to this point in detail in section 5.

3.2 Tree-level chambers and one-loop fibers

In this section, we present a concise overview of the tree-level chambers and one-loop fibers.
The task is now clear: fix a null polygon x at tree-level, compute the one-loop fiber geometry
A(x), and record the corresponding set of vertices V[A(x)]. As the tree-level data x varies, so
too will the vertex set V[A(x)]. A full classification of the tree-level chambers was provided
in [13], as we now review.

The set of vertices of any one-loop fiber consists of the cusps of the null polygon aj,
together with additional vertices arising from the triple intersections of lightcones N;, AN; ia)
Nz, These triple-cut vertices come either in the type Gir if all i,j,k are odd, or Vij if
all i,j,k are even. Remarkably, two odd vertices ijk and Tan can appear together in the
one-loop fiber only if, when represented as triangles tj;, and tjmn inscribed on the polygon
with odd vertices (1,3,...,— 1), the two triangles are non intersecting. A similar statement
exists for the set of even triple-cut vertices.

The upshot is that the tree-level chambers can be labelled by a pair T = (O,E) of
triangulations of an n-gon. The pair consists of one triangulation O made from triangles ¢;;,
containing only odd vertices of the n-gon, and E made from triangles containing only even
vertices such that

tijk €O => iit € V[Ar(x)], tigk CE => Gy € VIAr(x)], (3.8)

where we have introduced the notation Ar(x) for the one-loop fiber associated to T. We will
refer to these respectively as the odd- and even-triangulations. Note, the odd (resp. even)
triangulations are forced to contain all chords of the form (ii +2) for i odd (resp. even). This
combinatorial structure is also known as a scaffolding triangulation, and has recently been
important in the relation between stringy Tr(¢*) and Yang-Mills amplitudes [22, 23].

In fact, the dual of these triangulations are graphically equivalent to tree-level Feynman
diagrams of Tr(¢?) theory, which appear geometrically as the one-skeleton of A(x). As an
example at eight points, the odd and even triangulations which label the tree level chambers
are given by

Ti = (O1, Fi) = ({t13s, tis7}, {teae, t268}), Ti2 = (O1, E2) = ({t135, tis7}, {t2as, taes}),
To = (O2, E1) = ({t137, t357}, {t246, to6s}), To. = (Oo, E2) — ({t137, t3s7}, {t243, taes}). (3.9)

The dual of these triangulations are displayed in blue in Fig. 2, and are equivalent to the
one-skeleton of the corresponding one-loop fibers. An explicit example of a one-loop fiber for
the triangulation T>2 is depicted in Fig. 3.

From the definition of chambers it is clear that the union of all tree-level chambers recovers
the full tree-level geometry without overlap, and thus provides a triangulation of the positive
geometry. In this way the chamber decomposition expresses the tree-level amplitude as a sum
over the Catalan number squared many terms as

Q(O;] = » Oer|, (3.10)

where the sum runs over all pairs T = (O, £) of odd and even triangulations of the n-gon
and we have introduced the notation cr for the tree-level chamber labelled by T .

The one-loop ABJM momentum amplituhedron on the other hand can be decomposed
as a sum over all products of tree-level chambers times their one-loop fibers as

=Uer x Ar(x). (3.11)
aE.

This is a relation which extends to the canonical forms of these objects, which allows us to
arrive at a formula for the one-loop integrand as

Q [oe] = 2 Me A OAr(x)]. (3.12)

Remarkably, the canonical form of the one-loop fiber can be found directly from knowing the
vertices of the geometry. The canonical form of the oneoor fiber is immediately found to be

4 Half-chambers

It is clear from the previous section that the combinatorial structure of the one-loop fiber
A(x) is split into an odd side with facets Nz, for i odd, and an even side with facets Nz, for
i even. This is a consequence of the fact that lightcones naturally split up into a future t and
a past | lightcone:

NI = {ye Nz |y > 2}, NE ={yeN, | y < 2}. (4.1)

It is natural to keep track of these two pieces of information separately and to examine
the structure of the odd and even facets independently. This leads to the intuitive notion
which we refer to as odd (resp. even) tree-level half-chambers: regions of O; for which the
intersection patterns of the odd (resp. even) lightcones remain unchanged. Again we will label
these half-chambers by their respective odd co and even cg triangulations. We will define
skel! (xeven) and skel’ (Xoaa) as the combinatorial structure of intersections of Ni, Lee Noe
and Ni, an Nba respectively. The odd and even half-chambers are then defined as”

co: skel!(xoaa) constant, (4.2)

CE: skel* (xeven) constant.

The full chambers are then retrieved as the intersection of two half-chambers. For example,
in the language of half-chambers, (3.9) becomes

cr; =t0,¢p;, alternatively co, = er, Uer, and ep, = er, Uer;- (4.4)

This gives us an alternative half-chamber decomposition of the tree-level ABJM amplituhe-
dron form

QYOn] = Y> Qfco] = Y> Az). (4.5)
O E

This discussion is easily extended to all loops. When the full L-loop chamber was defined,
we were concerned with the combinatorial structure of the (L + 1)-loop fiber (3.7). More
precisely, this takes into account how the lightcone of yz41 € A(x) intersects the lightcones
of any of the 7; or the remaining loop variables y,. To define odd and even half-chambers for
higher loops, we instead care only about the intersections of the past and future lightcones of
Nyz41. This leads to the notion which we refer to as odd/even L-loop half-chambers: regions

of OW for which

ne :  skel+(xoaa3Y1,---Yz) constant, (4.6)
&) :  skel"(xeven} Y1,---sYz) constant. (4.7)

4.1  One-loop half-chambers

In this section we study the geometry of one-loop half-chambers. For simplicity, we restrict our
attention to odd half-chambers, the results immediately generalise to the even half-chambers.

4.1.1 Six-points

Before moving on to a general description of one-loop half-chambers, we will build an intuition
by investigating the six-point example in detail. Regardless of the tree-level data chosen, at
six-points, the one-loop fiber contains six vertices given by the cusps of the null polygon x
together with the two triple-cut points 35 and q54g- Therefore, it suffices to fix the null
polygon x once and for all and simply vary y; € A(x). To probe the structure of the one-loop
half-chambers we must determine how the vertices of the two-loop fiber A(x; y,) coming from
intersections of past lightcones change as we vary 1.

?Here we have introduced the notation Xeven = £2, @4,...,€2~, and similarly xoaq = 41, 03,...,€2k-1-

10
Figure 4. The lightcone of the vertex qj'3; divides Ag(x) into four regions. The negative part Aj, is

highlighted in red on the left, and part of the positive contribution Ay; = A(x, 72,3, g735) C Atgs
is highlighted in yellow on the right.

To begin, we focus on a single point O35 and determine whether it is a vertex of the
geometry A(x; y,). Suppose (yi — gj35)? < 0, then since A(x; y;) is defined to be all points
y2 € A(x) positively separated from yj, this implies that gi, is not a vertex of the two-loop
fiber. In this case the lightcone of y; cuts off the vertex Gas to generate three new intersection
points Gay. Boy, and Bey, as depicted in the first diagram of Fig. 5. Instead, if we now
ake yi such that (y1 — qj35)? > 0, we will find that qj; is a vertex of the two-loop fiber.
However, there are three possible configurations in which this can happen, also depicted in
Fig. 5, where the lightcone of y; cuts one of the edges NiN.N3, N3NNs5 or N51 generating
wo new intersection points is ee, or iva 3 respectively.

These four cases can be realised geometrically by refining the one-loop fiber A(x) by

he lightcone of q3,. This naturally decomposes A(x) into a region Ajj, which is positively
separated from Uss. and a region Aj,, which is negatively separated from Gras?

A(x) = Avs U Ags. (4.8)

The positive part Adie further splits into three regions which are geometrically four-point
one-loop fibers. Explicitly, we have

Atss = Ax U Ai35 U Ai35 = A(x), 22,03, G35) UA(as, 4,45, 435) UA(as5, 26,01, G35) "
(4.9)

This decomposition of A(x) is depicted in Fig. 4. If the loop variable y; is inside one of the
four regions Aj, Ayz3s, Aqg;, Ajgs, then the two-loop fiber A(x; y;) will precisely have the

structure depicted in Fig. 5, respectively.

Figure 5. A local view of the vertex qj,, € A(x) at six-points where the lightcone of the point
y1 € A(x) is depicted in red. Depending on the position of y, its null-cone will intersect in either of
the four configurations depicted above. The first diagram corresponds to (y — qi'35)? < 0 whilst the
remaining three terms correspond to (y1 — qi'35)? > 0.

Thus, at six points there are four one-loop odd half-chambers, and the skeletal structure
of the associated two-loop fiber takes the form of a planar three-point one-loop Feynman
diagram (without tadpoles), as depicted in Fig. 5. This is reminiscent of the skeletal structure
of n-point one-loop fiber, which takes the form of planar tree-level n/2-points cubic scalar
Feynman diagrams.

At tree-level, we further found it useful to consider the dual of these diagrams, which
are triangulations of n/2-gons. The analogous structure for these six-point one-loop half-
chambers are triangulations of a triangle (or rather ‘scaffolding’ triangulations of a hexagon)

with one internal puncture, which we denote graphically as

where the triangulations in this union are dual to the diagrams in Fig. 5.
The canonical form of the lightcone geometries Aj35, Ajg5, Aqg,, A,35 can be found by
summing over their vertices in precisely the same way as we discussed for the one-loop fiber

in section 3.2. Explicitly,

QYAggs] = W123 — Mogg, + Wag 1 — Wat -9» (4.0)
Q[Aj35] W345 W3agr Waghn5 Wot BL? (4.12)
Q[Az35] = w512 W51atg + MLatyg2 ~ Waity25? (4.13)
Q[A735] = woa6 Woah. Wat 6 Wi 62 . (4.14)

When adding these together we recover the canonical form of the full one-loop fiber, as
expected:

Q(AC&)] = Q[Agg5] + Q[Aggg] + O[Aq35] + 2[AG35)- (4.15)

4.1.2 Eight points

At eight-points there are two tree-level half-chambers, which means that we can no longer
discover all two-loop fibers by fixing x and varying y;. Instead, we need to study the structure

12
of A(x; y) by probing y; over A(x) for x in both of the tree-level half-chambers. An explicit
check yields 15 distinct one-loop half-chambers. The combinatorial structures skel+(xoaa; yi)
are recorded in Fig. 6. We again find that the past vertices of the two-loop fiber take the
form of a one-loop Feynman diagram for four-point Tr(¢?) amplitudes.

If we had instead fixed x in either one of the two half-chambers and then studied the
structure of the two-loop fiber as we varied y;, then we would have identified only 8 of the
15 half-chambers. To be more precise, if we fix x in the half-chamber whose one-loop fiber
contains aisy, 3575 then we will never be able to find a two-loop fiber which has the vertex
die or Uis7- Instead, we find only two-loop fibers A(x; y,) which are compatible with the
one-loop fiber A(x).

Using our graphical notation, the odd half-chamber decomposition of the one-loop am-
plituhedron takes the following form

(4.16)

The above diagrams are dual to the Feynman diagrams (past one-skeletons) appearing in Fig.
6 and are organised accordingly.

4.1.3 General number of particles

The technique to find one-loop half-chambers for a general number of particles is similar in
spirit to the arguments used in the six-point example. By fixing x, we find the various associ-
ated two-loop fibers by refining A(x) by the lightcones of all the Gin € V[A(x)]. This creates
some number of regions which give rise to different combinatorial structures of A(x; y1).

However, as we emphasised when studying the eight-point example, we will only discover
two-loop fibers which are compatible with the chosen A(x) if we proceed in this manner.
Since there are multiple tree-level chambers for n > 8 giving rise to different structures of
A(x), we need to sample x in all of the (Catalan number many) tree-level half-chambers.
This will allow us to find all possible past structures of the two-loop fibers, which defines the
full set of one-loop half-chambers.

Similar to the observation around Fig. 4 for six points, the lightcone of Disk generically
refines A(x) into four regions:

A(x) = Af, UAR, = (Ag, U Agg U Aig) U Aije (4.17)

These regions determine how the past lightcone of y; intersects the edges meeting at the
vertex Ginn: To determine the vertices of the two-loop fiber when there are multiple vertices
ijn € V[A(x)], we need to specify in which of these four regions y; is. Thus, for fixed x
we can find all possible structures of the two-loop fiber A(x; yi) by considering the maximal
intersections of the regions (4.17) for all vertices ijk € V[A(x)].

We start with a point x fixed inside a tree-level half-chamber specified by an odd scaf-
folding triangulation O of an n-gon. To refine these by one-loop half-chambers, we consider
how each of the (k — 2) triple cuts isk € O divide A(x) into four regions as in (4.17), and
then take their common refinement. Since each half-chamber is defined as the intersection of
(k — 2) regions taking the general form

n...NA;-—

we would naively expect to find 4*~? different two-loop fibers. However, many of these
intersections will be empty. Furthermore, many of the labels will be redundant as some of the

14
regions strictly contain others. We now move on to describe the set of non-empty intersections
in detail.

We first address the problem of redundancy of labels. In order to do so, we must determine
when a region in (4.19) is a subset of another. This only occurs when we consider the positive
parts with respect to a given triple-cut point. It is straightforward to see that one region AGE

is a subset of another A; when we have that

{ii +1,...,9} C{L141,...,m}. (4.20)

We now turn to characterising the set of non-empty intersections. First we inscribe an m-
gon with vertex labels {b1,b2,...,bm} inside the tree-level triangulation O using pre-existing
edges. This will split the set of triangles appearing in O into two subsets, those inside the
m-gon, which we shall denote Q, and those outside the m-gon, which we shall denote Q.
From the triangles contained in Q there will be m that share a boundary with Q which take

the form tp,e,d;,, € Q. All non-empty intersections then simply take the form

M+1

(4.21)
tijnEQ

Here we have introduced our familiar graphical notation for the one-loop half-chambers. The
region on the left of this equation gives rise to a two-loop fiber whose odd structure is dual
to the diagram on the right. We arrive at this diagram by starting from the odd tree-level
triangulation, removing all edges contained in the sub-polygon Q and introducing a red vertex
connected to all vertices of Q. The remainder of the triangulation is left unchanged. In this
way, each one-loop chamber is labelled by a triangulation of a once punctured k-gon. If it
is compatible with any other tree-level triangulation, i.e. only triangles appearing in O will
appear in the triangulation for the one-loop odd half-chamber, then it will also refine this one-
loop fiber. Note, this procedure never produces a triangulation whose dual Feynman diagram

contains a tadpole. Thus, n-point one-loop half-chambers are labelled by triangulations of an

n/2-gon with one internal puncture, and they will refine a given one-loop fiber exactly when
it is compatible with the underlying tree-level triangulation.

For each given one-loop fiber A(x), equation (4.21) defines a region inside A(x) which
gives rise to a compatible two-loop fiber. By definition, the structure of these one-loop fibers
remains constant over a tree-level chamber, however the same is not true for these regions. A
further refinement of the tree-level chambers is needed to determine their structure. We will
explain how this refinement works in appendix A.

Examples. Let us return to the eight-point example of section 4.1.2. We start from a point
x, inside the tree-level half-chamber O = {t137, t357} with one-loop fiber A(x,.). The one-loop

15
fiber is refined by the lightcones V+ and N.+_ as
N37 9357

A(x«) = Aggy U Ags, U Agsz U Aqs7 U (Aq37 9 Ags7)
U (Aiz7 MN Agsz) U (Ags7 M Aygz) U (A137 9 Ags7) . (4.22)

Using our graphical notation, the above refinement of the one-loop fiber reads

(4.23)

Had we began with a point x’, in the tree-level chamber labelled by O = {t135, tis7} we would
have instead found

(4.24)

Importantly, the labels in (4.23) and (4.24) should be interpreted as regions of the one-loop
fiber A(x), with x held fixed, such that the structure of the two-loop fiber reproduces the
corresponding diagram. Consequently, the associated canonical forms depend solely on the
oop variable y;. In contrast, the diagrams in (4.16) represent regions of the full one-loop
amplituhedron OW, and thus their canonical forms depend on both the tree-level x and the
oop-level y, variables.

4.2 Higher loop half-chambers

Much of the structure of one-loop half-chambers can be generalised to higher loops as well.
The most striking general structure comes from the way we label the half-chambers. We have
argued that tree-level half-chambers can be labelled by cubic tree Feynman diagrams with
n/2 particles, and similarly one-loop half-chambers are labelled by cubic one-loop Feynman
diagrams. In general, the L-loop half-chambers are captured by (tadpole-free) L-loop cubic
Feynman diagrams on n/2 particles. Furthermore, these labels directly describe half of the
combinatorial structure of the (L + 1)-loop fiber. We sometimes prefer to think in dual
diagrams, in which case the half-chambers are instead labelled by odd/even triangulations of
n-gons with D punctures.

The fact that the half-chambers for ABJM are labelled by Feynman diagrams for a cubic
scalar theory with half the number of particles is at first sight very surprising. However,

we can gain some intuition for this statement from the geometry. From the definition (3.7),
it is clear that we can obtain every (ZL + 1)-loop fiber A(x; y1,..., yz) from the L-loop fiber
A(x; y1,---,Yyz—1) and intersecting with Nit. The argument now follows an inductive reason-
ing where we assume that the past boundaries of L-loop fiber indeed look like an (Z—1)-loop
Feynman diagram. Intersecting this with Ni will cut away a region contained in the past

lightcone of yz, which will induce a new loop in the diagram.

As an example, let us focus on the two-loop half-chambers for n = 4. Since there is a single
tree-level and one-loop chamber, we can treat the data (x; yi) as fixed. The two-loop fiber
contains vertices x together with the four triple-cut points {3y. > Cyn Bay Gay, Using
the null cones of the odd vertices we can split the two-loop fiber into two-loop half-chambers.

We find that the two-loop fiber is split into 8 regions whose labels are displayed in Fig. 7.

5 Relation to BCFW

In this section we show the connection between the half-chamber expansion and the BCFW
expansion of ABJM integrands.

5.1 Tree-level

We focus first on tree level, where the BCFW recursion for ABJM amplitudes is represented
in terms of on-shell diagrams as [24, 25]

_ > (2h, 52k) . (5.1)
ky tkp=k+1

17
Since our discussion is largely taking place in dual momentum space, it is natural to associate
these diagrams to their dual, in which case the BCFW recursion takes the form

<< F

= > 3 (5.2)
ky tkp=k+1

The lower-point amplitudes on the right-hand side can themselves be decomposed recursively
until only four-point tree amplitudes remain. We will follow a specific recursion scheme: at
each step, an internal vertex is introduced into every subpolygon with n > 4 vertices. This
vertex is then connected to the two vertices adjacent to the vertex added in the previous step,
as well as to one additional vertex chosen such that the resulting subpolygons each have an
even number of vertices. By repeating this procedure, the recursion systematically reduces
all subpolygons to four-point amplitudes. For example, at ten points the recursion takes the
following form

QAO
VAG,
AD

In the dual on-shell diagram, we now consider replacing an internal vertex connected to
vertices i, j,k with the triangle t;;, through a ‘Y-A transform’. Our choice of BCFW recursion
guarantees that the triangles share internal chords. As an example, after applying the Y-A
transform to each internal vertex, the final form of the 10-point recursion is given by

Written in this form, the BCFW recursion can be interpreted as a sum over triangulations

j

of the all-even or all-odd subpolygon, depending on the initial choice of legs used in the
recursion. Diagrammatically, this is equivalent to the Berends-Giele recursion for tree-level
k-point amplitudes in Tr (¢°), that is

= » ; (5.5)
ki +k,=k+1
To convert a triangulation of the odd/even subpolygon back into a traditional on-shell diagram
we simply take the medial graph of the triangulation i.e. for each edge of the triangulation we
introduce a vertex and connect all vertices which appear as an edge in a triangle. An example
of this procedure (omitting all external legs) for the ten-point tree-level amplitude is given by

Note, this prescription for the tree-level BCFW recursion appeared already in [17, 25], and
the corresponding on-shell diagrams were termed ‘trees of triangles’ in [26].

Thus, using the diagrams we have introduced, the BCFW recursion for tree-level ABJM
amplitudes is equivalent to the sum over all odd/even triangulations of an n-gon. But this is
exactly the combinatorial data we associate to tree-level half-chambers! In fact, we claim that
this relation is precise: given an odd/even triangulation of an n-gon, the associated on-shell
function is equivalent to the canonical form of the associated half-chamber. The argument
for this claim is straightforward. We first note that each term in the expansion (5.2) can be
interpreted as a leading singularity of a one-loop integrand AW. Explicitly,

i J

Res Al) = : (5.6)
(y—ai)?=0
(y—23)2=0
(y-ax)?=0 k

We know that we can expand the one-loop integrand in terms of tree-level chambers and
one-loop fibers (cf. equation (3.12)). By definition, the canonical form of A(x) satisfies that

Res Q[A(x)] = 1 if dk a vertex of A(x) (5.7)
(y—ai)?=0 0 if Gr not a vertex of A(x)
(y—2;)"=0
(y-m.)?=0

It is therefore clear that this residue is only supported by terms where the one-loop fiber
A(x) contains the vertex Fan Furthermore, the result of the residue of AW will therefore

be the sum of canonical forms of all tree-level chambers which contain the triangle ¢;;;, in

their triangulation. Similarly, we find that the on-shell functions labelled by any (partial)
odd/even triangulation of an n-gon is given exactly by the sum of chambers which contain all
the triangles in the triangulation. We thus see that the on-shell function of a full odd/even
triangulation is exactly the canonical form of the tree-level half-chamber with the same label.
As we have repeatedly emphasised throughout this paper, the dual of an odd/even trian-
gulation of an n-gon is a tree-level Feynman diagram for k-point Tr(¢°), and the BCFW cells

are thus in a bijection with these Feynman diagrams. For Feynman diagrams, the internal
edges correspond to physical poles of the amplitude, but for the corresponding BCFW cell

19
these edges correspond to spurious boundaries instead. Said differently, two BCFW cells share
a spurious boundary when they are related through an ‘s-t channel flip’. Since the boundary
structure of k-point tree-level amplitudes in Tr(¢°) is captured by the associahedron [7], we
see that the adjacency graph of BCFW cells for ABJM is also an associahedron.

5.2 Loop-level

The all-loop extension of the BCFW recursion for integrands in ABJM reads [17]

eA .

Using the same logic as for the tree-level case, we find that the all-loop recursion can be

represented graphically as a recursion enumerating all triangulations (without tadpoles) of an

L-punctured k-gon as*

= (5.9)
oe =k+1,
Lit+L,=L

Again, this recursion is diagrammatically equivalent to the Berends-Giele recursion for L-loop
Tr(¢?) integrands. As a further example at six-point one-loop we have two factorisation and
one forward-limit term resulting in the following

VV WY
VV

By taking the medial graph of these triangulations we arrive at the familiar representations

of the 6-point one-loop integrand in terms of on-shell diagrams given by

VP wy B (6.11)

Remarkably, as noted in section 4, the L-loop half-chambers are captured by the very same
diagrams. We again claim that the canonical form of the half-chamber is equivalent to the cor-
responding on-shell function. Hence, the half-chamber triangulation of the ABJM momentum

5We thank Hadleigh Frost for introducing us to this recursion relation and for providing a generating
function for the number of triangulations (with tadpoles) of an L-punctured k-gon.

20
amplituhedron gives a precise geometric interpretation to the loop-level BCFW expansion.
The notion of compatible half-chambers which define an L-loop chamber can thus equivalently
be phrased as a question about ‘compatibility’ between BCFW cells.

Performing the recursion relation we find that the number of terms in the BCFW rep-
resentation for the L-loop integrand are counted by the number of triangulations (without
tadpoles) of an L-punctured k-gon given explicitly by*

ngcew(k, L) =

2h (2k —2
L'\k-1

Vee 1) (2L4+2k-1), 5. (5.12)

This formula extends to all loops the counting already observed at tree-level, one-loop, and
two-loops in [17, 25], where it reduces to the Catalan numbers, CS ) and 4(k — ye)
respectively. Note, the 1/L! factor takes into account the symmetrisation of each diagram

with respect to the loop variables.

6 Loop chambers

So far we have mainly considered L-loop half chambers: regions of ow) which determine
half of the vertices of the (L + 1)-loop fiber. The full structure of the (LZ + 1)-loop fiber is
captured by L-loop chambers, which arise as the intersection of one odd and one even L-loop
half-chamber.

As we reviewed in section 3.2, the tree-level half-chambers are given by odd/even trian-
gulations of an n-gon, and the tree-level chambers are given by pairs of such triangulations.
Any combination is allowed: an odd and an even tree-level half-chamber will always intersect.
At loop level, the half-chambers are given by triangulations of an L-punctured k-gon, or,
dually, by an L-loop Feynman diagram. Again, the L-loop chambers are given by pairs of
these labels, however it is no longer the case that any pair of odd/even half-chambers will
intersect. Out of the ngcrw(k, L)? possible L-loop chambers only some subset will have a
non-empty intersection.

We recall from section 4.1.3 that we can associate to each one-loop half-chamber a corre-
sponding sub-polygon of an n-gon. A necessary condition for two half-chambers to intersect is
that the associated sub-polygons overlap. However, this is not a sufficient condition and a full
classification of which half-chambers intersect is currently not known beyond the examples we
present in this paper, i.e. four-point one and two loops, six-point one loop, and eight-point
one loop.

6.1 Examples

The remainder of this section will be used to study several examples of loop chambers.

6.1.1 Four-point one-loop

At four-points there is a single odd and a single even half-chamber, resulting in a single one-
loop chamber whose label is depicted on the left of Fig. 8. The dual of this triangulation is
depicted in blue on the same figure. Comparing this to the two-loop fiber geometry depicted
in Fig. 9 we conclude that (the dual of) the one-loop chamber labels completely specify
the one-skeleton of the corresponding two-loop fiber. This is analogous to the situation at
one-loop where (the dual of) the labels for the tree-level chamber completely specify the
one-skeleton of the corresponding one-loop fiber.

6.1.2 Six-point one-loop

In section 4.1.1 we saw that there are four odd and four even six-point one-loop half-chambers.
As was already observed in [13], only 13 out of the 16 possible intersections are non-empty.
The compatibility of the half-chambers is summarised in Table 1.

Let us show explicitly how the one-loop fiber A(x) is divided into one-loop chambers.

Lastly, we have the chamber c~ := Aj3, 9 Aj4,. This chamber is depicted in Fig. 13, and

does not have any vertices. As such, it also has a vanishing canonical form.
When we add up the canonical forms of the first 12 one-loop chambers, we retrieve the
canonical form of the full one-loop fiber, as expected:

Q(A(x)] = > (Q [ee] +2 [cP] ). (6.5)

i=1

Although not directly obvious from the forms we present here, it is possible to find the
canonical form of these lightcone geometries as a sum over vertices in the exact same way as
the one-loop fibers of section 3.2 and the one-loop half-chambers of section 4.1.1.

6.1.3 Four-point two-loop case

As a two-loop example, let us consider the four-point case. Since there is a single tree-level and
one-loop chamber we can treat the data (x; y;) as fixed. As we noted in section 6.1.1, the two-
loop fiber contains vertices x together with the four triple-cut points {diby, + Q3y1° Bay, Way ae
Using the null cones of the odd vertices we can split the two-loop fiber into two-loop half-
chambers. We find that the two-loop fiber is split into 8 regions whose labels are displayed
in Fig. 7.

The full two-loop chamber consists of non-empty intersections of odd and even two-loop
half-chambers. We list all the non-empty intersections in Table 2, where we label the half-
chambers by two-loop Feynman diagrams, which are dual to the diagrams depicted in Fig. 7.

This gives a concrete geometric interpretation for the

BCFW recursion. Moreover, this result highlights a curious bijection between diagrammatic

expansions of loop integrands for n-

26

point ABJM and n/2-point Tr(¢°) theory. The explicit
form of the loop-level BCF W recursion is then equivalent to loop-level Berends-Giele recursion
for Tr(¢°).

There are many interesting questions which naturally arise from this work. In the re-
mainder of this section we will highlight some of the more pressing open problems.

Connection to Tr(¢?). The duality between BCFW cells for ABJM and Feynman diagrams
in Tr(¢?) is highly suggestive. Physically, these two theories could hardly be more different
(one a scalar theory with cubic interactions, the other a supersymmetric theory with only
even-point interactions), and as such there is no a priori reason to expect any relation. It
would be interesting to see if this connection can be used to find new, more concrete, formulae
for loop integrands in ABJM theory. For instance, it is natural to investigate whether or not
we can find some generalised current for the off-shell Berends-Giele recursion which directly
calculates ABJM amplitudes.

Furthermore, there has recently been an interest in the loop integrands in Tr(¢°) theory
and scaffolding triangulations coming from the surfaceology framework, and the connections
o amplitudes in NLSM and Yang-Mills. These novel techniques are essentially efficient ways
o sum all Feynman diagrams, and hence it is natural to ask whether similar formulations
can be found for ABJM.

We note that connections between ABJM theory and Tr(¢°) were already observed in
27|, where it was argued that the singularity structure of tree-level ABJM amplitudes are
completely contained in the singularities of Tr($?). The current discussion adds additional
evidence for some connection between the two theories, although any concrete relation remains
o be clarified.

Loop Chambers. We have given a complete classification for all non-empty L-loop half-
chambers in terms of [-loop Feynman diagrams. Full L-loop chambers are given by the
intersection of two ‘compatible’ half-chambers. At tree-level, any even and odd half-chambers

are compatible, giving a classification for all tree chambers as pairs of tree-level Feynman

liagrams. However, we have seen that this structure does not persist to loop level, and the
classification of compatible half-chambers is not known beyond the examples we worked out

n this paper.

To give a full description of the L-loop ABJM momentum amplituhedron by fibrating one
of the loop variables, it is necessary to get a full classification of the compatible k-point L-
loop Feynman diagrams (or, dually, triangulations of k-gons with L punctures), which describe

ct

1e skeletal structure of the (L + 1)-loop fiber. Given the geometric nature from which this
question arises, we expect there to be an elegant combinatorial answer. Furthermore, due
to the relevance of these diagrams for other areas of physics and mathematics, it would be

interesting to see if this notion of compatibility is of relevance in other contexts.

Breakdown of Fibrations. The idea of fibrating a single loop variable over a lower-loop object
can be iterated to write ol as a sum over tree chambers times L three-dimensional lightcone

geometries. This is equivalent to the approach taken in [15] for loop integrands in NV = 4

27
SYM. Unfortunately, for the case at hand the canonical form no longer distributes over this
product. To highlight this point, let us look at a simple 2-loop example for n = 4. We have
seen that there is only a single one-loop chamber, of, and hence the geometry splits up like

OP OP's 79), (7.1)

where f) is the two-loop fiber depicted in Fig. 9. This is a valid factorisation of the geometry,

however it does not extend to the level of canonical forms:
Q(o?)| 4 Q[09?} a aff]. (7.2)

This mismatch between the factorisation of the geometry and the canonical form is somewhat
surprising and goes contrary to the usual ‘chambers and fibrations’ philosophy. At this stage
it is not quite clear where this important property breaks down, especially as it is known to
work in many other cases [9, 13-16, 19-21].

It is important to investigate when this logic breaks down. Gaining a better understanding
of these cases might help remedy the above discrepancy. This is particularly important since
the canonical form of lightcone geometries can easily be found once the vertex structure is
known. Hence, if there is a way the above discrepancy can be remedied, the combinatorial
information on loop chambers and fibers we uncovered in this paper could directly be used
to find efficient new formulae for higher loop integrands for ABJM.

Extension to V =4 SYM. Scattering amplitudes in ABJM theory are remarkably similar in
structure to those of V = 4 SYM. Of particular importance is the fact that NV = 4 SYM also

allows a geometric description in terms of loop fibers which consists of lightcone geometries

in dual space [14]. Hence, it is natural to ask whether the techniques and results of this paper

can be generalised to this setting. Particularly, it would be interesting to see if the study of
L-loop chambers for NV = 4 SYM can be used to rediscover the loop-level BCFW recursion.
This would provide an alternative geometric interpretation to loop level BCFW.

Negative Geometries. An object of recent study both in NV = 4 SYM and ABJM theory
is the so-called negative geometry first introduced in [28]. The negative geometries arise
from the definition of the amplituhedron upon relaxing or flipping the sign of the mutual
positivity conditions between loop momenta. The simplest class of such geometries are given
by the all negative ladder geometries characterised by the constraints (Yq — Ya+1)? < 0 for all
a€ {1,...,L—1}. The negative ladder geometries for MHV integrands in NV = 4 SYM have
recently been computed for all n and L in [16], and it would be interesting to see whether the
analogous result can also be obtained for ABJM theory. We expect the chambers introduced
in this paper to aid in this calculation.

Furthermore, we have shown that fibrating a loop variable and splitting the lightcone of
yx into a future and a past lightcone naturally leads to the discovery of the loop-level BCFW
triangulation. These ideas can easily be applied for negative geometries as well, and as such it
would be interesting to see if we can use this logic to derive BCFW-like recursion for negative
geometries.

BDS Integrand for ABJM. Very recently, the scaffolding triangulations which describe tree-
level BCFW have proven to be useful for the description of the so-called BDS integrand of
ABJM [29]. It was further shown that this graphical representation remains in tact after
integration. The work we presented in this paper gives a natural generalisation of these
diagrammatics for higher loop BCFW, and as such it would be interesting to see whether this
can be given a similar interpretation in relation to the BDS integrand.

A Refinement of Tree-Level Chambers

In this appendix we will show that it is necessary to refine tree-level chambers in order to
accurately capture the combinatorics of the loop level structure beyond the one-loop fibers.
This statement is equivalent to an observation in [9] for n = 10, where it was noticed that
the tree-level chambers need to be refined if one studies how the structure of A@)(x) changes
when we vary x. Our discussion coincides with their results.

We proceed in the spirit of the discussion outlined in section 4 by keeping x fixed in
some tree-level chamber T' = (O, E) and studying the refinement of the one-loop fiber A(x)
by the lightcones of vertices Gite Starting at n = 10, the geometry of the refined one-
loop fibers are no longer specified by the tree-level chambers, and further information is

required. A hint that this would happen could already be seen in the decomposition Ave =
AGE U Aig U A from equation (4.17). Let us consider the ten-point example with tree-level
chamber O = (tis, tis9, ts79), B= (to46, t2610, tesio)- We are now interested in the vertices
of Az3z = A(a5, 76,27, 28, 19,010, £1, G35), Which is an eight-point one-loop fiber. We know
that the vertex structure of an eight-point one-loop fiber is not uniquely determined, as there
are four different tree-level chambers. To find which vertices are part of Az3s we ask which
triple intersection vertices ijk are positively or negatively separated from O35

The first important observation is that all odd Gin are always positively separated from
one another, and similarly for all even Vine In our example this means that the vertices O35
and e79 are part of Ajsz, which specifies the odd half-chamber structure of this one-loop
fiber. What about the even half-chamber? The even tree-level half-chamber of this ten-point
A(x) has the structure of a five-point tree-level Feynman diagram, which is depicted in Fig.
14. The question about the structure of the even half-chamber of Ajz3; can then be phrased

Yeaio)” > O (right).

as a question about which edges of this graph is intersected by the lightcone N. ahes It turns
135
out that there are two options:

e If (@f35 — dao)” < 0, then Az3s has vertices qo, andqa, .
8104135 684135

Pt _ besvce sea _
If (a135 — Gai)” > 0, then Azys has vertices qggi9 and Irogiag”

These possibilities are illustrated in Fig. 14.

Whereas the odd/even triangulations of the 10-gon were sufficient to specify the com-
binatorial structure of A(x), this information is not sufficient to specify the combinatorial
structure of A735 or the fully refined one-loop fiber. Instead, one additional bit of informa-

tion is needed: namely whether iss and qgi9 are spacelike or timelike separated. The surface
(Gias aa desin)” = 0 will refine the tree-level chamber into these two cases.

We thus see that tree-level chambers are refined by the signs of Can - Gi) However,
not every combination of signs is allowed. In the preceding example, the sign of (Gigs — 496 fay
is fixed to be negative for all points in this tree-level chamber, and hence there is no further
refinement due to this pair of vertices. The reason for this is because the cuts associated to
these vertices are ‘incompatible’ in the sense that there is no planar on-shell diagram which
realises both cuts at the same time. This can easily be seen by noting that the triangles ty35
and t2610 intersect inside a 10-gon. Of the 25 tree-level chambers at ten points, there are

e 10 chambers that do not refine any further, coming from the fact that there are no
compatible Gin and Gije>

e 10 chambers that get refined into two smaller chambers, since there is one pair of
compatible cuts (like the example above),

e 5 chambers which get refined into four smaller chambers, due to the fact that there are
two independent pairs of compatible cuts.

lightcone of qj35 is represented by the red ellipse. Although the cut qj, is compatible with both 951919
and qggio, we see that choosing (qj'35 — 51012)? > 0 (7-€. 951912 is outside the ellipse) automatically

implies that also (4735 — Ga1o)? > 0.

Table 3. The number of chambers and refined chambers for n < 20.

In total, we thus find that the 25 chambers get refined into 50 chambers, and in each of these
refined chambers the structure of the one-loop (half-)chambers will be different. These refined
tree-level chambers agree with those found in [9].

This continues for higher points. Two cuts Gir and q,,, are compatible if the triangles t;;,
and tape do not intersect, and compatible cuts can be either positively or negatively separated.
However, there is one further complication which occurs starting from 12 points. We consider

wo compatible cuts Giger and q,,, corresponding to two non-overlapping triangles ¢;;, and tape.
The triangle tq. divides the n-gon into three regions with corners [a,b] = {a,a+1,...,b},
b,c] = {b,b+1,...,c}, and [c,a] = {c,c+1,...,a}. The non-overlapping nature of these
riangles means that {i, 7, k} must be a subset of one of these three index sets, say {a, b]. If we
consider a tree-level chamber which contains Ginn and q,,-, then we can refine this chamber
by taking Can - Vabe)” to be either positive or negative. However, if we choose this to be
positive, then any triangle in the subpolygons [b,c] and [c,a] must automatically also be
positively separated from Gian: This is illustrated with an example in Fig. 15.
We list the number of refined tree-level chambers in Table 3. We note that these re-
finements are sufficient to describe the one-loop (half-)chambers, however for higher loop
half-)chambers further refinements might be needed. The logic is similar, to refine an L-loop

31

(half-)chamber, we need to consider pairs of compatible vertices of the associated L-loop fiber.

B_ One-loop Chambers at Eight Points

To study the one-loop chambers for eight points, we first fix the null-polygon to be in one
of the four tree-level chamber T = (O, E) depicted in Fig. 2. As we discussed in section
4.1.2, as we vary y; around A7(x) we will find exactly eight different structures for both
skel’ (x aa; y1) and skel"(xeyen; y1), which correspond to the one-loop half-chambers which are
compatible with O and E. This gives a total 64 possible two-loop fibers which we could
encounter as we vary y1, of which only 47 are realised. We summarise which two-loop fibers
can be found for O = (137, t357), E = (t2a6, tasg) in Table 4. Using symmetry, we can easily
find the possible two-loop fibers for x in one of the other three tree-level chambers. This gives
us a full classification of the structure of possible two-loop fibers, and hence of all one-loop
chambers. We find a total of 157 one-loop chambers at eight-points.
