We experimentally investigate the influence of surfactant adsorption kinetics on cavity dynamics
during the rapid formation of interfaces. For this purpose, we use a submillimeter jet impacting onto
a surfactant-laden liquid pool much larger than the jet dimensions. Cavity retraction and closure
occur on a submillisecond timescale, posing a stringent test of the ability of surfactants to reduce
surface tension dynamically. Our experiments reveal the difference between the effects of sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS), a surfactant with moderately fast adsorption kinetics, and Surfynol 465, a
surfactant with ultrafast adsorption kinetics. For SDS, the collapse pathway is nearly indistinguish-
able from that of pure water, suggesting negligible dynamic surface tension reduction. In contrast,
Surfynol allows the emergence of deeper cavities that persist longer in the liquid pool. The harmonic
oscillator model accurately captures the cavity retraction in the deep seal regime. The fitted values
of the damping ratios are consistent with the dynamic surface tensions.

I. INTRODUCTION

The formation and evolution of liquid—fluid interfaces
occur in a wide range of physical, biological, and tech-
nological processes. The presence of surfactants heavily
influences the dynamics of these interfaces. Surfactants
dissolved in a liquid phase adsorb at the liquid-fluid inter-
face and alter interfacial mechanics [1-6]. Surfactants are
nearly unavoidable in real environments and can regulate
many interfacial processes even at trace concentrations
7|. At higher concentrations, surfactant can drastically
change multiphase flows on the millimeter and submil-
imeter scales. Some relevant examples include droplet
coalescence [8, 9] and fragmentation [10, 11], bubble sta-
bility [12, 13], air entrainment [5, 14, 15], and tip stream-
ing [1, 6], among many others.
Surfactant adsorption kinetics at liquid—air interfaces
are recognized as a key factor shaping transient inter-
facial properties during rapid flows [2, 16-18]. When a
new surface is created (e.g., during jet or drop impact on
a solid surface or a liquid pool), the initial surface ten-
sion practically equals that of the pure solvent. Then,
he surface tension progressively decreases as surfactant
molecules diffuse and adsorb to the new interface. The
imescale over which dynamic surface tension approaches
its equilibrium value is set by either diffusion of the sur-
actant molecule, the interfacial adsorption energy bar-
rier, or a combination of both [2]. In many cases, this
imescale is much larger than that characterizing the sur-
ace growth. Only “ultrafast” surfactants (those with
very high adsorption rates) significantly reduce the sur-
ace tension during the rapid interface creation in phe-
nomena such as the jet or drop impact, which takes place
on timescales of the order of a few milliseconds. Standard
surfactants fail to act on those timescales, even though

they produce a considerable reduction in surface tension
at equilibrium.

The effect of surfactant kinetics has been observed in
droplets impacting onto both a solid surface [16] and
surfactant-laden pools and liquid films [17, 18]. Vargh-
ese et al. [16] showed that only ultrafast surfactants sig-
nificantly affect the maximum spreading diameter of a
droplet impacting a smooth substrate. These surfactants
trigger splashing or rim breakup at much lower Weber
numbers than those of standard surfactants when the
droplet impacts onto a surfactant-laden pool. Both nu-
merical and experimental studies have demonstrated that
Marangoni stress can delay or reshape the dynamics of
interface retraction, particularly when the surfactant ef-
ficiently populates the rapidly expanding interface.

A new interface is rapidly generated when a train of
droplets or a jet strikes a liquid pool. Researchers have
mapped out the universal stages of this ballistic process:
expansion, retraction, and closure via interface pinch-off
of the cavity formed by the impact [19, 20]. This cavity
can develop features similar to those seen in rigid-body
impacts [21]. A balance of inertia and both capillary and
viscous forces governs these stages. Three main cavity
closure pathways have been distinguished: shallow seal,
deep seal, and surface seal. The selection of the closure
pathways can be predicted from the values of the Weber

bers characterizing the problem (here v; and rj; are the
jet velocity and radius, respectively, p and ju are the den-
sity and viscosity of the liquid pool, respectively, and 7
the liquid-air surface tension).

Consider a submillimeter jet impacting on a low-
viscosity liquid pool (characterized by a low Ohnesorge
number). The shallow seal occurs for low enough Weber
numbers. In this case, the maximum penetration depth

of the cavity is relatively small, and the interface pinches
close to the pool’s free surface (Fig. la). Higher Weber
numbers result in the deep seal closure, where the cavity
ypically penetrates deeper into the pool and the inter-
face pinches farther from the surface (Fig. 1b). In these
regimes, the cavity may experience successive pinch-offs
at multiple positions. Lastly, the surface seal occurs for
sufficiently high Weber numbers. In this case, the sur-
face closure occurs while the cavity is still expanding,
and the interface pinches above the pool’s surface (Fig.
c). Similar cavity profiles have recently been reported
when the target object is a droplet or a capillary liquid
ridge [22, 23]. In all of these cases, high-speed jets and
droplets create cavities that expand and collapse within
submillisecond timescales. Numerical simulations reveal
how the transition between capillary-driven deep seal clo-
sure and gas-pressure-driven surface seal closure becomes
sensitive to impact parameters and fluid properties, pro-
viding a new methodology on rapid interfacial dynamics
Directly linking surfactant kinetics to measurable me-
chanical outcomes during high-speed interface creation
remains a challenge. To address this problem, we uti-
ize submillimeter jet impact on liquid pools. This phe-
nomenon allows us to create a new interface at a con-
rolled rate that can match or exceed the adsorption rate
of the surfactant dissolved in the liquid pool. Our ob-
jective is to report new jet impact experiments and to
utilize them as a diagnostic for surfactant kinetics.

In this study, we compare the effects of Sodium Do-
decyl Sulfate (SDS) and Surfynol 465 [25] on the impact
of submillimeter jets on a water pool. These surfactants
produce practically the same decrease in the surface ten-

sion of the air-water interface at equilibrium. However,
the adsorption rate of Surfynol is supposed to be signifi-
cantly larger than that of SDS, as suggested by the exper-
iments of Varghese et al. [16]. Our experimental configu-
ration enables us to select a hydrodynamic timescale that
is much smaller than that characterizing SDS adsorption
but comparable to that of Surfynol, thereby revealing the
role played by surfactant kinetics. We observe significant
differences between the penetration depths and cavity re-
traction times of the experiments with SDS and Surfynol.
These experiments show how the surfactant kinetics set
limits on reducing surface tension during rapid events.
Our findings may provide a valuable reference for the
selection of surfactants when rapid interface formation
occurs in technological or medical applications, such as
liquid microjet impingement for electronic cooling [26],
high-speed emulsification systems [27, 28], or in needle-
free injection systems [29, 30], where enhanced spread
and adsorption of the drug in the target tissue is desired.

The manuscript is organized as follows. Section II for-
mulates the problem and provides the governing dimen-
sionless parameters. Section IIT details our experimental
method. Section IV presents a comparison of cavity evo-
lution for the two surfactants. Section V summarizes the
main findings of the work.

II. FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM

Consider a liquid bath (pool) with density py and vis-
cosity fp. A liquid jet of density p;, viscosity p.;, radius
rj, and velocity v; hits the bath free surface (Fig. 2).
The surface tension of the air-liquid bath interface in the
absence of surfactant is o,. We will analyze the evolution
of the cavity resulting from the jet impact. Specifically,
we will determine the cavity penetration depth d as a
function of time ¢t (¢ = 0 corresponds to the jet impact
instant).

The initial surfactant concentration on the liquid pool
surface is [9 (the surface coverage, measured in mols per
unit area). The surfactant strength can be quantified
by the maximum packing concentration [,,. In addi-
tion, D and D, are the volumetric and surface diffusion
coefficients, respectively. In the Langmuir model, the ad-
sorption and desorption constants k, and kg characterize
the surfactant sorption kinetics [2].

It is instructive to formulate the problem in dimen-
sionless terms. Assuming that the gas phase is air and
in the absence of surfactant, the dimensionless depth
d= d/r; depends on the density and viscosity ratios,
p = p;/py and p = pj/J1, the Ohnesorge number Oh=
py / (pyr joc)*/?, the Weber number We = pov77j/Fe; and
the dimensionless time + = t/t,, where t, = r;/v; is
the characteristic time. The dimensions of the pool are
assumed to be much larger than the jet radius and the
cavity penetration depth. This ensures that boundary
effects are negligible throughout the jet impact and the
resulting cavity evolution. Therefore, the problem does
not involve any geometrical parameters other than rj.
The Bond number B = Pog; /o~ takes values of the or-

der of 10~°, and, therefore, gravity can be neglected.

In the presence of an insoluble surfactant, the pa-
rameters characterizing the surfactant effect are the ini-
tial (equilibrium) surface coverage [9 = Tp/T'x, the
Marangoni number Ma=I,,R,T/o,, where R, and T
are the gas constant and liquid temperature, respectively,
and the surface Peclet number Pes = rjuc /Dgs number,
where ve = 0¢/{Up is the viscous-capillary velocity. In the
presence of solubility effects, one must also consider the
bulk Peclet number Pe = r;v,/D. The surfactant solubil-
ity is characterized by the dimensionless adsorption and
desorption constants, ka = Toke/ve and ka = rjka/Ve-
We conclude that

d= d(p, 1, Oh, We; To, Ma, Pes; ka, ka, Pe: 7). (1)

We will compare the impact of jets on a water pool con-
taining either SDS or Surfynol. In both cases, the jets are
made of the same liquid and have the same radius and
velocity. The surfactants do not significantly alter the li
uid pool density and viscosity. Consequently, the values
of p, 4, Oh, and We are the same in the two experiments.
The surfactam concentrations are such that [9 ~ T’
Therefore, 9 ~ 1 in all the experiments with surfac
tants. The maximum packing concentration T,, (and,
therefore, Ma) takes similar values in the two surfactants.
The Surfynol diffusion coefficients are unknown. How-
ever, it can be expected to be similar to those of SDS
because the molecular weights of the two molecules are
comparable (the molecular weights of SDS and Surfynols
are 288 g/mol and 666 g/mmol, respectively). Therefore,
we can assume that the Peclet numbers also take similar
values in the two experiments. The jet impact entails
the rapid creation of a new interface to which surfactant
adsorbs. This implies that ka is expected to be more im-
portant than ka in our experiments. We conclude that

SDS and Surfynol must be attributed essentially to the
adsorption coefficient ka. We will change the charac-
teristic time of interface production by changing the jet
velocity (the Weber number). This will enable us to as-
sess the impact of the adsorption rate on the dynamics
of the cavity. Table I shows the values of some of the
above-mentioned dimensionless numbers.

We will consider dimensional quantities in our analysis
to show the spatial and temporal scales of the problem.
It is worth noting that the characteristic length rj and
time t, take practically the same values in each pair of
SDS and Surfynol experiments. Therefore, the discussion
in Sec. IV on the differences between d(t) obtained with
the two surfactants can be extrapolated to the differ-
ences between their dimensionless counterparts d(7). As
mentioned above, these differences can essentially be at-
tributed to the values of the adsorption constant for SDS
and Surfynol, with the adsorption constant for Surfynol
being unknown.

lil. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD

Our experiments follow the protocol established in
Refs. [23, 24] to produce submillimeter jets from the
laser-induced cavitation. A custom-fabricated borosili-
cate glass microfluidic chip was filled with an aqueous
solution of Allura Red AC (Sigma Aldrich) at 0.5 wt%
to enhance laser absorption. Jet generation was achieved
by tightly focusing a pulsed laser (Litron, Nano S, 4 ns,
532 nm) at the chip base. To ensure reproducibility of the
jet size and velocity, the bubble location and filling level
in the liquid channel were kept constant. The induced

pressure pulse and the rapid bubble expansion drive the
formation of a high-speed submillimeter jet. The jet ra-
dius, measured far from the nozzle, was approximately
35 um, and the jet velocity varied between 9 m/s and
33 m/s, corresponding to Weber numbers in the range
of 34 to 527. These values were obtained by carefully
tuning the laser energy between 172.3 J and 580.6 yJ.
The Supplemental Material shows illustrative videos o
the jet target.

The receiving pool walls were made of acrylic and
mounted beneath the jet axis. The dimensions of the
pool were 24 x 24 x 48 mm’, larger than 10° times the je
radius and the cavity penetration depth. We conductec
experiments with ultra-pure Milli-Q water and aqueous
solutions of SDS (Sigma-Aldrich) at 8.1 mM and Surfyno
465 (Evonik) at 10 mM. These concentrations approxi-
mately correspond to the critical micelle concentrations.
Figure 3 shows the surface tension o as a function o
the surfactant volumetric concentration c for SDS and
Surfynol. Experiments were conducted at 21 + 1°C.

cavity evolution were captured using a high-speed camera

level. The images

quence of images for SDS is similar to that of pure water.
In the two cases, the cavity closure can be categorized as
a shallow/deep seal, characterized by fast interface recoil
driven by capillarity. This suggests that the properties of
the cavity-pool interface remain essentially unchanged,
as the adsorption rate of SDS is insufficient to fill the
new interface created by cavity penetration. Our results
align with recent studies [16, 17], which found that slow
or moderately fast surfactants exert little influence on
interfacial dynamics because interface creation outpaces
surface renewal timescales.

It is worth considering the difference between the cav-
ity growth in this problem and the well-known ejection
of Worthington jets by bubble bursting [5]. The initial
stage of cavity growth in our problem substantially dif
fers from that leading to the Worthington jet emission in
bubble bursting. In our problem, we hypothesize that the
jet’s impact on the pool surface creates a surfactant-free
region that serves as the cavity precursor. The cavity
interface grows from that clean region. Therefore, sur-
factant molecules cannot be dragged to the cavity apex.
Conversely, the Worthington jet in bubble bursting arises
from a surfactant-enriched region of the bubble [5]. Sur-
face convection drags the surfactant molecules and accu-

over a typical experiment duration of 20 ms. The images
were analyzed with a custom-made MATLAB script to
obtain the evolution of the cavity profiles. Figure 4 shows
the experimental setup.

The sequence of images for Surfynol differs significantly
from that of water and the SDS aqueous solution (note
that the scale bar in the images of Surfynol is different).
The cavity initiated in the Surfynol-laden pool exhibits a
pronounced growth phase, followed by a slow, symmetric
retraction. The process leans toward a persistent deep
seal: the cavity penetrates deeper before slowly retract-
ing, resulting in a more drawn-out evolution. This effect
is consistent with trends observed in drop-on-liquid in-
terface experiments [17, 31]. The effect of Surfynol can
be attributed to its rapid adsorption at the newly created

surface, which lowers the surface tension.

One may wonder whether the differences in cavity
growth with SDS and Surfynol can be explained in terms
of Marangoni stress caused by the Surfynol concentration
gradient. Howe arangoni stress is typically associ-
ated with the partial immobilization of the interface [2].
This is contrary to what we observe in our experiments,
where the interface is mobilized (expands faster than in
he clean water) by adding Surfynol.

The differences between the cavity evolution are quan-
tified in the graphs of Fig. 5b, which show the cavity pen-
ration depth d(t). The maximum penetration depth for
water is practically the same as for the SDS aqueous so-
lution, while it increases by about a factor of three in
the presence of Surfynol. The retraction is much slower
in the presence of Surfynol. We will examine this last
process in more detail in Sec. IVC.

We conclude that noticeable differences in cavity dy-
namics appear depending on the kinetics of the surfactant
dissolved in the liquid pool. When the pool contains an
ultrafast surfactant, the cavity grows deeper and retracts
considerably slower than in pure water or an aqueous so-
lution of a standard surfactant. In other words, in the
presence of an ultrafast surfactant, the cavity reaches a
greater depth and persists longer before retracting and

closing.

B. Maximum cavity depth before pinch-off

To further investigate how surfactant kinetics affect the
cavity penetration dynamics, we measured the maximum
cavity depth reached before the interface pinches over a
range of jet velocities, from approximately 10 to 30 m/s.
The results are shown in Fig. 6a. Similar values of the
cavity maximum depth were measured for pure water
and the aqueous solution of SDS across the investigated
velocity range, reinforcing the idea that SDS does not
significantly change the effective surface tension during
the rapid interface formation.

For vj; © 10 m/s, the maximum cavity depth for
Surfynol is 0.99 +0.08 mm, nearly twice that in pure wa-
ter (0.55 + 0.04 mm) and notably greater than that for
SDS (0.68+0.06 mm). This difference becomes even more
apparent at intermediate velocities; for vj ~ 20 m/s,
Surfynol allows a cavity depth of 3.52 + 0.12 mm, while
the depths in pure water and with SDS are 1.23 + 0.06
mm and 1.36 + 0.08 mm, respectively (see Fig. 6a).

As the jet speed is increased further (vj; ~ 30 m/s),

ing regime, where the new interface is created so quickly
that even ultrafast surfactants cannot lower the surface
tension within the critical stage of cavity expansion. To
illustrate this idea, Fig. 7 compares the interface growth
rate dS/dt (S is the interface area) in the presence of
Surfynol for v; = 14 m/s and 30 m/s. The maximum
value of the interface growth rate during the cavity for-
mation for vj = 30 m/s is more than three times the
value corresponding to vj = 14 m/s.

In principle, surfactant adsorption at a new interface
can be limited by either diffusion, adsorption, or a com-
nination of both [2, 6]. However, the negligible effect
of SDS on the cavity dynamics cannot be attributed
o limited diffusion. As mentioned in Sec. I], the dif
fusion velocity for SDS is expected to be similar to
hat of Surfynol. Therefore, the differences between the
wo surfactants should be attributed to their adsorption
rates. Diffusion can still be a limiting factor in this phe-
nomenon. However, its effect on the cavity dynamics is
expected to be essentially the same for the two surfac-
ants.

C. Model for cavity retraction

To quantitatively describe the cavity retraction, we
employ a simple nondimensional harmonic oscillator
model. Let € = d/dmax and T = t/tic be the normalized
cavity penetration depth and dimensionless time, respec-
tively, where tic = \/pod3,,,./cer is the inertio-capillary
time (p4d3,,, is proportional to the liquid displaced by
the cavity). We assume that the effective surface tension
et is the clean interface value o = 0.072 N/m for SDS
and the equilibrium value ¢ = 0.031 N/m for Surfynol.
We suppose that the penetration depth evolves according
to the harmonic oscillator equation

a2.
To +E +E=0, (2)

where ¢ is the dimensionless damping ratio. In this ap-
proximation, the cavity retracts due to the restoring force
associated with an effective surface tension, and viscosity
opposes the retraction. The fitting parameter ¢ plays the
role of the effective Ohnesorge number defined in terms
of the liquid viscosity, effective liquid mass, and effective
surface tension.

Our experiments show that €(r) corresponds to an
overdamped oscillation. In this case, ¢ > 1, and the
solution of Eq. (2) is the exponential relaxation function

&(r) = Aexp(—AiT) + Bexp(—Aor), (3)

where Ay9 = ¢+\/¢?—1, and A and B are constants
determined by the initial conditions.

In our analysis, we compare the exponential decays in
the presence of SDS and Surfynol. We restrict our analy-
sis to intermediate jet velocities for which the same (deep
seal) closure mechanism is observed. Table I shows the
values of the only fitting parameter ¢. Figure 8 shows
the good agreement between the experimental data and
the solution (3) to the model (2).

As mentioned above, the damping ratio ¢ plays the role
of an effective Ohnesorge number Oher = ju5/(met et)!/?,
where mer = pod?.,, is the effective value of the
mass liquid displaced by the cavity and surface ten-
sion. Therefore, the effective surface tension can be
calculated as oer = (jo/ps) Ohgdin3. Assuming that

that the rapid adsorption of Surfynol plays a key role in
reducing the dynamic surface tension.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We experimentally investigated the impact of a sub-
millimeter jet on a liquid pool, both with and without
surfactants, to explore their effects on this phenomenon.
We changed the characteristic time of the cavity forma-
tion and collapse by varying the jet speed. Our results
show that the maximum cavity depth and timescale of its
retraction depend significantly on the rate of surfactant
adsorption. As hypothesized, a standard surfactant such
as SDS does not significantly affect the cavity dynamics.
Conversely, ultrafast surfactants such as Surfynol allow
the emergence of deeper cavities that persist longer in
the liquid pool. This reinforces the idea that only sur-
factants with remarkably rapid activity can noticeably
alter interface dynamics when a new surface is generated
very quickly. In contrast, conventional surfactants typi-
cally produce effects only at later stages of this process.
Our analysis reveals that Surfynol effects persist across
a wide range of impact conditions but ultimately fade at
the highest jet speeds. This reveals a kinetic limit where
even rapid surfactant action is outpaced by the creation
of the interface for the ultrafast surfactant used in this
work.

By fitting cavity profiles to the overdamped oscillator
model for cases where deep seal closure occurs, we link
the mechanical response to an effective dynamic surface
tension active during the retraction event. The agree-
ment between the fitted damping ratios and surface ten-
sion measurements validates this approach and highlights
the importance of rapid adsorption in reducing interfacial
tension.

The capacity of surfactants to dynamically reduce sur-
face tension during rapid interface formation is crucial
for controlling fast interfacial flows in both natural pro-
cesses and technological applications. Here, we have uti-
lized submillimeter jet impacts on surfactant-laden pools
as a test bed to investigate the extent to which surfac-
tant adsorption kinetics can influence cavity evolution
on submillisecond timescales. However, our conclusions
