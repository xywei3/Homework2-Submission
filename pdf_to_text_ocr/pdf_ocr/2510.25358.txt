We investigate the dynamics of correlation propagation in the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard
model with SU(N) symmetry when the replusive-interaction strength is quenched from a large value,
at which the ground state is a Mott-insulator with 1/N filling, to an intermediate value. From
approximate analytical insights based on a simple model that captures the essential physics of the
doublon excitations, we show that entanglement in the initial state leads to collective enhancement
of the propagation velocity vgu(w~) when N > 2, becoming equal to the velocity of the Bose-Hubbard

model in the large-N limit. These results are supported

density correlation in the quench

Introduction. Exquisite controllability of quantum
simulators, such as optical lattices loaded with ultracold
gases [1, 2], Rydberg atom arrays [3, 4], trapped ions [5—
7], and superconducting circuits [8, 9], have provided
unique opportunities for studying non-equilibrium dy-
namics of closed quantum systems. In particular, exper-
iments simulating the single-component Bose-Hubbarc
model (SCBHM) with nearest-neighbor hopping [10, 11
and S = 1/2 spin models with interactions that alge-
braically decay with distance r as ~ r~® [12-14] have
addressed dynamical spreading of correlations. The ques-
tion of how quantum correlations propagate in isolated
quantum systems which undergo unitary time evolution

is a fundamental problem having attracted interest for
decades in the context of quantum-information propa-
gation and thermalization [10, 15]. Previous theoretica
studies have shown that when the interactions are short-
ranged or the power a of the algebraic interactions is

sufficiently small, the correlations exhibit light-cone-like
propagation with a certain speed [17-28].

In Refs. [10-14], the observation of light-cone-like prop-
agation was indeed reported. In these examples, the ini-
tial state is a simple product state, namely a Mott insu-
lator with unit filling or a spin-polarized state, such that
the correlation propagations are qualitatively understood
using the quasi-particle picture, in which quasi-particles
excited on top of the product state carry correlations.
This naturally poses the question of whether there are
other intriguing mechanisms of correlation propagation
starting from more complicated entangled initial states.

Quantum simulators of the Fermi-Hubbard model
(FHM) with SU(N) symmetry, which are composed of
N-flavor Fermi gases of alkali-earth(-like) atoms in op-
tical lattices [29-34], have been remarkably developed
recently [2, 35-37]. Thanks to the Pomeranchuk cool-
ing mechanism, the 1/N-filled Mott insulating state of
the one-dimensional (1D) system with N = 6 has been
cooled down to T ~ 0.1J/kg in recent experiments [32],
where J is the hopping energy. At such a low tempera-

ture, the system is expected to exhibit the behavior of
a (N — 1)-component Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid [38],
which is highly entangled in comparison with the Mott
insulator of the SCBHM. The entanglement entropy is
proportional to N — 1 [39] so it can be systematically
controlled by varying N. Moreover, quantum-gas micro-
scope techniques with single-site resolution have recently
been applied to alkali-earth(-like) atoms in optical lat-
tices [40-42], allowing for access to the dynamics of a
density-density correlation in the SU(N) FHM.

In this paper, we analyze the correlation-propagation
dynamics of the 1D SU(N) FHM after a quantum quench
starting from a 1/N-filled Mott insulator. From approx-
imate analytical calculations based on the assumption
that the correlations are carried by doublon-holon ex-
citations, we find that the effective hopping of doublon
excitations increases with N due to high entanglement of
the particle-excitation states, and that it coincides with
the hopping of particle excitations in the SCBHM in the
limit of N — oo. Furthermore, using matrix product
state (MPS) methods [45], we numerically calculate the
time evolution of the density-density correlation function
to show that the correlation-propagation velocity indeed
increases with N due to the enhanced hopping.

Model and protocol. We consider the 1D SU(N) FHM,

where ¢, is the annihilation operator of flavor-a fermion
at site j, tay = Bh Oa, J the hopping energy, U(> 0)
the onsite repulsive interaction, and L the number of
sites. This model quantitatively describes N-flavor 1D
Fermi gases with SU(N) symmetry confined in optical
lattices [29-34]. We are interested in propagation of
quantum correlations captured by the time evolution of
the density-density correlation function,
Dr, t) = (HO|(Rj+r — A)(Rj — MYO), (2)

where n = Np/L is the average number of particles per
site, Np the total number of particles, and ij = Yo, fa,j-
D(r,t) can be measured in experiments using quantum-
gas microscopy techniques [10]. As an initial state, we
anticipate the ground state of Eq. (1) with 7 = 1 in the
limit of U/J — oo, which is a Mott insulating state. At
t = 0, we set U/J to be finite and calculate the unitary
time evolution, |y)(t)) = e~#/"\(0)), with the time-
independent Hamiltonian. In short, we analyze dynamics
subjected to a quantum quench from U/J — 00 to a finite
value of U/J. Hereafter, we set h = 1 and a = 1 except
in the figures, where a is the lattice spacing.

For the SCBHM, the Mott insulating ground state at
U/J > o~ is a simple product state with no entangle-

ment, namely, Qj |n);, where |n); is the local Fock
state at site 7. In the present case, by contrast, the
Mott insulating ground state is a (N — 1)-component
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid of its flavor sector so that its
half-chain entanglement entropy is approximately pro-
portional to N — 1 [39]. We will see that such relatively
large entanglement plays a crucial role in the correlation-
propagation dynamics.

Analytical calculations. Let us analytically obtain an
approximate expression of the correlation-propagation
velocity. For the SCBHM, when the initial state is an
MI state with nm = 1, the correlation is carried domi-
nantly by a hole-doublon excitation [10, 17]. We expect
this to also be the case for the SU(N) FHM so we focus
on how a holon and a doublon propagate in the medium
of the 7 = 1 MI state. While a doublon is always ac-
companied by a holon in the full model, considering the
two separately allows us to understand their properties
better.

To illustrate the important physics, we first consider a
simple 2-site model for SU(2) and SU(3). On the basis
of this, one can obtain a rough estimate of the velocity
at which an excitation can move between two adjacent
sites. In Fig. 1 the holon |h;) and doublon |d;) states
and connections between possible configurations for the
SCBHM, SU(2), and SU(3) FHMs are displayed. These
connections are possible in the sense that they are con-
nected by the hopping term of the Hamiltonian, each
with a matrix element corresponding to +J. For the
SCBHM, it is well-known that the propagation speed of
the holon and doublon are qualitatively different due to
bosonic enhancement. In the two-site model, this is ob-
served in the matrix elements for connecting the two sites
as (h|Hpu|h2) = —J and (d4|Apu|d2) = —2J. This
factor comes from the definition of the bosonic creation
and annihilation operators. For the SU(2) case, no such
enhancement is possible as doublons correspond to two
different flavor fermions and each doublon configuration

on the left only connects to one doublon configuration on
the right. Indeed, in terms of the collective state defined
in Fig. 1, (hi|Hsu(2)|h2) = —J and (di|Hsuqy|d2) = —J.
For the SU(3) case, however, due to the presence of mul-
tiple doublons any configuration with a doublon on the
left will connect to two configurations on the right and
vice versa. Conversely any configuration with a holon
on the left side will only connect to one holon config-
uration on the right side. This means that the matrix
elements for the collective states defined in Fig. 1 are
equivalent to the SCBHM, that is (hi |Hsuca) hg) = —J

and (di|Hsu(3y|d2) = —2J. This is a crucial observation

which also holds true for larger N and larger L.

In order to understand this more systematically, we
consider the following two models: (i) Np particles of
each flavor, with Np = N Np total particles in L = Np—1
sites, restricted to the Fock space containing one double
occupation with the remaining sites having unit filling.
(ii) Np particles of each flavor, with Np = N Ng total
particles in L = Np + 1 sites, restricted to the space
containing one hole with the remaining sites having unit
filling. For N = 2, this does not correspond to the sit-
uation in Fig. 1 in the sense that the minimal multi-site
models consistent with the SU(2) case is Np = 4 and
L = 3,5, although the physics is very similar. As we
give a detailed explanation of these models in the sup-
plemental material [43], we only summarize some of the
most important features here. One can always define a
model in terms of an effective lattice with L sites and a
arge local Hilbert space of dimension Qq or Qn, where

The behavior for holons observed in the simple two-site
model holds for any N, that is, they will only ever connect
© one adjacent holon state. The equal-superposition
collective states |h;) form a disconnected sector in the
Hamiltonian with matrix-elements that correspond to
a standard single-particle Hamiltonian with hopping J.
For periodic boundary conditions this holon sector forms
the energy band E(k) = —2Jcos(k) so that the maxi-
mum group velocity of the holon is 2, where k = 2a
with n = 0,...,.L—1. There will be no sectors with a
larger bandwidth indicating that there is no enhancement
for the holon velocity as expected.

As we saw in the simple two-site example, N > 2 leads
to doublon configurations that connect to two states with
a doublon on the adjacent site. For Np > N, however,
not all the terms in the collective state connect to two
states. One can use combinatorial arguments to count
the number of states Q; or Qy that connect to one or
two adjacent states respectively [43], which determines
the matrix-element between two adjacent superposition

Illustration of a simple two-site model for SCBHM, SU(2) and SU(3) FHM (for simplicity we restrict SU(3) to the
ground-state symmetry sector Na = Ng = Nc = 1). The green, blue and red circles correspon

to different flavors, while the

empty circle corresponds to a hole (an empty site). We can define the SU(2) and SU(3) equal-superposition collective doublon
and holon states as |d;) = 1. _, |d;,,) and |hj) = oF >, |Ajv), where j = 1,2.

For N = 2, where Q2 = 0, K = 1 at all values Np.
In this case, similar arguments as for the holon case lead
to a disconnected sector in terms of the superposition
states with energies E(k) = —2Jcos(k). Hence, the
SU(2) case has no enhancement for the doublon veloc-
ity. For N = Np (the illustration of Fig. 1 corresponds
to N = Np 3), Qi 0 and Kk 2J. The equal-
superposition collective state will therefore always have
matrix elements (dj|\Hsu|dj41) = —2J. Similarly to
the previous cases, the matrix-elements of these collec-
tive states form a disconnected sector in the Hamilto-
nian governed by a free particle Hamiltonian, but now
with an effective hopping of 2J. For periodic boundary
conditions the energies are therefore given by —4.J cos(k)
so that the maximum group velocity of the doublon is
4J.
The ground-state sector in the large N limit of N = Np
is fully equivalent to results obtained from the SCBHM
doublon model. In fact, this equivalence is not only ob-
served for these simple excitation models, but is a general
feature for the ground state sector of SU(N) fermionic
Hamiltonians when N = Np. In the supplemental mate-
rial [43], we show that states obeying SU(N) symmetry
such as the ground state are described by a disconnected
subsector equivalent to single-component bosonic Hamil-
tonians with the same parameters.
For N > 2 and Np > N, the equal doublon superpo-
sition states will not separate into their own sector and
obtaining analytical results for the band structure, which

is closely related to the propagation velocity, is difficult.
However, the value A obtained as the matrix element
between the naive equal superposition states gives some
indication of the propagation speed. In the supplemental
material, we show results of exact diagonalization calcu-
lations of the actual spectrum [43]. These show that a
naive calculation based on K slightly underestimates the
bandwidth, because not all the states in Q; an
be in an equal superposition in the relevant linear combi-
nations that determine the minimum and maximum en-
ergy. Nonetheless, the results suggest that the behavior
of the bandwidth is qualitatively similar. AK asymptot-
ically decreases to a value limypo. K = 2(1 — 1/N)J
as the system size increases. This asymptotic value itself
grows asymptotically with N towards the SCBHM equiv-
alent value of K = 2J in the limit of N > oo. These
results strongly suggest that velocity enhancement will
be observed for N > 2 even when Np > N and that the
enhancement qualitatively behaves like 2(1 —1/N).

Numerical calculations. Having explained the underly-
ing physical mechanism of the enhancement of the prop-
agation velocity, we investigate the dynamics of the full
SU(N) FHM numerically with use of the time evolving
block decimation method [44] based on the MPS repre-
sentation of quantum many-body states [45] (See also
Supplementary material [43] and Ref. [46] for specific
MPS representations in the present case). The expected
enhancement is only possible for superpositions of dou-
blon states. This means that in terms of the original
model, the initial state must have a large degree of en-
tanglement in the flavor sector corresponding to super-
positions of different flavors on each site. The existence
of enhancement is therefore strongly dependent on the
initial state and can only be observed for quantum su-

perposition states, which means that high temperature
will destroy the effect. Similarly a classical product state
with no entanglement in the flavor sector should lead to
no enhancement. We investigate the SCBHM and SU(N)
FHM with N = 2,3,4, and 6 using the ground state at
Uini = 407, which we obtain by means of the density
matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method [45], as
our initial state. Additionally we investigate a product
state |ABCD....ABCD) time-evolved by the SU(4) FHM.
In order to more easily observe the propagation of cor-
relations, it is useful to normalize D(r) for each value r
with the maximum absolute value it takes during time-
evolution, i.e.,

~ D(r,t)

DO) = Tice (DD) @)

Our main focus is on the case Ugn/J = 8, where

we expect the enhancement but the interaction is still
small enough that accurate numerics can be obtained.
In Fig. 2(a)-(f), the time evolution of D(r,t) for several
r is plotted for the SU(N) FHM with N = 2,3,4, and
6, and the SCBHM (see the figure caption for more de-
tails). In all cases, we see a characteristic dip in D(r, t)
for fixed distances r. The time at which the dip forms
a minimum changes linearly with r, indicating a light-
cone-like propagation of the correlation [10, 17]. The
propagation velocity is clearly different for the different
cases. The table in Fig. 2(g) shows the result of fitting
a straight line to the location of the dip over time, that
is the propagation velocity v as well as the uncertainty
of the fit. In general we see that for L = 24, where
we have more points, the uncertainty becomes smaller.
It is difficult to say anything systematic about how the
system size affects the velocity aside from this based on

the limited number of results. The overall behavior is at
least consistent with the N-dependence of the velocity
obtained from the simple model of excitations. Specifi-
cally, vgui2) < 4J while vsuiv) approaches the SCBHM
results with increasing N. Although a functional depen-
dendce (1 — 1/N) is within the margins of error, achiev-
able L and N are so limited that it is hard to say anything
quantitative.

For bosonic and SU(N > 2)-superposition enhance-
ment to occur, a relatively large value of Ug,/J is re-
quired and one expects the velocity to be dependent on
Usn/J. For the SU(2) case and the ABCD product state
on the other hand, we expect that the velocity should
be less dependent on Ugn/J. Numerically it becomes
more difficult to obtain good results as Ug, /J increases,
so we are limited to smaller values. In Fig. 2(g), we
show usu) for Usn/J < 12. For Usgn/J = 0 and 2,
all velocities are generally bounded by 4. This means
that for such a drastic quench the initial Mott insula-
tor melts down almost completely so that the correlation
is propagated by a single particle with the energy band
—2Jcos(k) [17, 22]. The cases of SCBHM and SU(N)
FHM with N = 3 and 4 display enhancement beyond
this starting at Ug, /J = 4, although a value Ug,/J = 6
is required for behavior that is consistent with our expec-
tations based on the simple model of excitations in the
Mott limit.

Summary and outlook. We studied dynamics of the
correlation propagation starting from a 1/N-filled Mott
insulator in the 1D SU(N) FHM by means of both ana-
lytical and numerical calculations. For the SU(2) FHM,
we showed that the collective enhancement of the effec-
tive hopping is impossible and the propagation velocity
is bounded by 4Ja/h for all values of the interaction,
similar to the behavior of non-interacting bosons. For
N > 2, however, entanglement in the initial state gives
rise to the collective enhancement of the hopping, leading
to a higher velocity, and the velocity approaches Ja/h,
the same value as that of the SCBHM, at the large-N
limit. We conjectured that for large lattice sizes the
SU(N) FHM will interpolate between the SU(2) FHM
and SCBHM cases as vsuiw) = (4(1—1/N) +2) J. It
will be interesting to examine this conjecture in future
experiments. We numerically found that the collective
enhancement is absent when the initial state is a simple
product state. Since the high-temperature state of the
flavor sector in the 1/N-filled Mott insulator is a mixed
state of all the permutations of the product state with
equal probabilities, this strongly indicates that the en-
hancement of the velocity can only be observed for tem-
peratures on the order of T ~ 0.1J/kg or lower.

$1. Restricted Fock-space representations for doublons and holons

8.1. Doublon restricted Fock-space representations

In this section we give a few more details on the representation of the Hilbert space restricted to one doublon in a
system with L = Np — 1 sites.

S1.1.1. Determining the values Q1,Q2 and K

In order to determine the values Qi and Q2 which counts the number of doublon states that connect to only 1
neighboring state and two two neighboring states respectively, we use the binomial formula which counts the number
of possible ways to pick k objects from n objects, which can also be used to count the number of ways one can
distribute & elements on n sites. To connect to two states we must first choose two flavors to represent a doublon on
a given site, this can be done in (3) ways. We must then choose one of the remaining flavors to occupy the adjacent
site as this is what allows for connecting to two states, which can be done in (7°) ways. We than need to distribute
the remaining particles. Note that we have used one particle of 3 flavors, which means that these three flavors have
Np — 1 particles left that can be distributed on the remaining L — 2 lattice sites in Ge) Guat (a) ways.
Once we have placed one set Np — 1 there will be Np — 1 less lattice sites in which to replace the remaining, accounted
for by the second and third term in in the product. Finally for N > 3 there will also be N — 3 sets of Np particles
that must be distributed on the remaining lattice sites. Accounting for the particles removed with the placement of

each flavor set this can be done in Hj (PR eis ways. Putting everything together we therefore get

m= (VO Vea) Coes Vet) IE

j=

where the product in the second line has no contribution for N = 3.

The number of doublon states that only connects to one adjacent doublon state are counted in the following way.
After we pick the two flavors representing the doublon in (3) ways, we instead need to pick one of those two flavors
for the adjacent site (blocking the movement of one of the particle flavors) which can be done in @) ways. We
than have one flavor where we have removed two particles, one flavor where we have removed one particle and one
flavor where we have removed 0 particles. Placing these sets in the remaining L — 2 lattice sites can be done in
( Noo) Coe) Owes ways, where again we have accounted for having removed the number of lattice sites
corresponding to the particles placed between each binomial coefficient. As before one finds that for N > 3 there

remains N — 3 sets of Np particles that can be placed in Tce 4 ‘Ge aa ways. This leads to

where the product in the second line has no contribution for N = 3.

Writing out the definition of the binomial coefficients and canceling out common terms the value K is then given
by Eq. (4) of the main text.

In a similar way to find the total number of states, we simply pick out two flavors for the doublon in CG ) ways.
Next we have to place the Ng — 1 particles of the two picked out flavors in the remaining L — 1 sites. We then have
to place the Np particles of each remaining flavor in the remaining L + 1 — 2Np lattice sites. We can write this as

_ a oy ™ .
2(N — 2)!(Np — 1)!2NplY-2’

(S3)
where the last line is obtained by writing out the definition of the binomial coefficients.

S$.1.1.2. Large N-limit Np = N

For the large N-limit of Np = N (Np = 1) the number of possible states that have one doublon on a given site
simplifies to Q = Qo = x. We can think of all the possible combinations of having a doublon at site j as belonging
to a pseudo-lattice described by L sites with local Hilbert spaces of dimension Q label by i;) where j = 0,...,Q— 1.
The local Hilbert-space can always be spanned by Q vectors and using the linearly independent basis set |i;) one can
define a new linearly independent basis set in terms of the Fourier transform as

1 ¢,
IIe) = Sq De Pls) (84)
j=0

where k = 0,1,...,Q. These are linearly independent and taking the inner product between the k = 0 (corresponding
to the equal superposition state |d;) = et ay |i;)) and any other state one obtains the well-known relation

1 ee
7) So FI = Sno (S5)
j=0

Let us next consider the matrix element of the Hamiltonian between the k = 0 superposition state on one psuedosite
and an arbitrary k-state on the adjacent psuedosite in terms of these these new basis states:

Q-1
(HUEE+ Yo) = % YY eH Mip| AG +),)
j.s'=0
gy 22
= 2 eH = 25. (s6)
a

Here we used the fact that one state always connects to two adjacent states with a value J which means that the sum

over j’ can be evaluated for any j as 2J which can then be taken outside the sum. This shows that the k = 0 local

states never connect to any other k # 0 states under the action of the Hamiltonian and we can therefore solve the
= 0 sector separately in terms of a simple non-interacting Hamiltonian given by

Het = -2 J (he,jéon.s4 + hc.) (S7)
J

where ele creates the superposition states (and we are constrained to the one-particle sector neg = 1. This also
holds for periodic boundary conditions in the original system in which case the eigenenergies are given by —4J cos(p)
Qn

with p = “—* where n =0,1...,2—1.

S.1.1.3. SU(2) case for general Np

Finally we consider the case N = 2 where Q = Q; = wea We can think of this problem in two ways. Similar
to before we can define this system in terms of a psuedo-lattice of size L with a local Hilbert-space of dimension Q.
Each state on site j will connect to one state on site j + 1 and for open boundary conditions the system Hamiltonian
will actually split into exactly Q different unconnected sectors each corresponding to a single-particle problem with
an effective hopping J. Indeed numerical calculations in the restricted Fock-space also show that the spectrum will
correspond to the single-particle spectrum for J with a Q-degeneracy for each energy. We can consider these sectors
as corresponding to different pseudoflavors. Periodic boundary conditions complicate the picture, however, as they
will connect two different pseudoflavor sectors pairwise. For periodic boundary conditions, however, we can define
the equal superposition state in the same way as we did for the N = Np case. The pairwise connections between
pseudoflavors then simply leads to a standard periodic boundary condition for the single-particle Hamiltonian that

FIG. $1. The numerical spectrum for the restricted Fock spaces corresponding to the holon (a) and doublon (b) models for

can be written in terms of the matrix-elements of these superposition states. The exact same argument using the
basis of Fourier transforms leads to this being an unconnected sector and for periodic boundary conditions we expect
Qn

that the groundstate spectrum is given by —2Jcos(p) with p= “-* where n =0,1,...,2—1.

$.1.2. Holon restricted Fock-space representations

In this section we give a few more details on the representation of the L = Np +1 one holon restricted Hilbert-space.
This is much simpler than the doublon-case and there are no specific cases which we have to consider separately. In
this case the number of possible ways to have a holon on one site is as follows: After choosing the holon site there

will be (a) ways to place one flavor (oN) ways to place the next flavor etc. which leads to

_ Np —jNp\ _ Np!
e~ 0 ( ) ~ (pl) ee

We can once again think of the system in terms of a pseudolattice with L sites and local Hilbert space size Q. As for
the SU(2) doublon case each state on site j will connect to one state on site j + 1 and for open boundary conditions
the system Hamiltonian will split into exactly Q different unconnected sectors each corresponding to a single-particle
problem with an effective hopping J. This is also corroborated by numerical ED calculations. Periodic boundary
conditions will again introduce hopping between two pseudoflavors, but by taking the equal superposition state of
all possible holons on one site i a standard single particle Hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions can be
written in terms of their matrix elements. This sector will once again be disconnected by the same arguments as
presented previously and we once again expect that the spectrum will be given by —2J cos(p) with p = 20m where
n=0,1,...,£—1. Again we emphasize that this is true for any N and and Np which means that holons will never
have any speedup, similar to the bosonic case.

S.1.3. ED calculations in the restricted Fock-spaces

Finally we show a few full exact-diagonalization (ED) calculations for the restricted Fock-space sectors. This is
both to corroborate the above results and to investigate the doublon case for N > 2, Np > N, where we do not know
the precise nature of the spectrum because we heuristically estimate the matrix element K of the doublon hopping
under the assumption of the equal superposition of each doublon configuration. Note that the dimension of the total
Hilbert space corresponding to the restricted spaces grows exponentially with the the system size as D = LQ, where

the main text, AE based on —2K cos(p) with p = BE where n = 0,1,..., 2 — 1 and AE based on exact diagonalization are

shown.

Q is given by Eq. (S3) for the doublon model and Eq. (S8) for the holon model. The largest systems for which we
can calculate the full spectrum is therefore limited to Np = 9 for SU(3) and Np = 8 for SU(4). This means that
finite-size effects have a strong influence.

In Fig. S1, we show the numerically obtained spectrum for the SU(3) Np = 9 doublon (LZ = 8) and holon (L = 10)
models. Note that these spectra has a large number of energies due to the large Hilbert-spaces, but the width of the
spectrum AE = Emax — Emin is indeed determined by a separable sector with —2J cos(p) for the holon model. For
the doublon model on the other hand, we do not know what the exact width should be as Np > N. It is however
interesting to compare with a naive model which considers the k = 0 equal superposition and a corresponding spectrum
determined by —2K cos(p) with p = enn where n = 0,1,..., —1. We expect that this might give us a qualitative
indicator of the behavior as K contains the information about the ratio of states that connect to two adjacent sites
vs one adjacent site.

In Table S1, we compare the numerical values of AE, K and analytic values AEx corresponding to the naive
model. For N = Np, the prediction of the naive model becomes exact as per the arguments in Sec. $1.1.2 and this
is borne out by the numerical results. For Np > N, the naive model consistently underestimates AE. Nonetheless,
qualitatively the naive model has a similar behavior to the numerical results. Particularly the relative values of AE x
between different values of Np has the same ordering as for AP.

$2. Generic equivalence between the ground-state properties of SU(N) fermions and Np bosons when N > Np

In the previous section, we investigated the one doublon and one holon restricted excitation subspaces describing
them in terms of an effective free Hubbard Hamiltonian and showed that the ground-state subesector of the SU(V)
free Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian was equivalent to the bosonic Hamiltonian when the number of flavors exceeds the
total particle number. This is in fact a special case of a more general equivalence between the ground state sector of
SU(N) fermions and single-component bosons for N > Np in the 1 particle per flavor (1PF) subsector. In this section
we will show that the matrix elements of the SU(N) symmetric k-reduced density matrix (k-RDM), ie.,

N k

bau) (litem sme) = STP a4, [Pema (S9)
jal

a1,.04=1 j=1

will contain the matrix elements of the bosonic k-RDM as an embedded subsector corresponding to the states obeying
SU(N) symmetry in the 1PF sector. This means that any standard Hamiltonian which obeys SU(N) symmetry such
as the two-body Hamiltonian

Hyun) = S2 So hyn pak + ¥> SO Vjnimal Gh gu 34m, (S10)
a jk a8 jklm

will similary have the bosonic Hamiltonian embbeded as a separable subsector corresponding to the states obeying
SU(N) symmetry in the 1PF sector. As the ground state of any Hamiltonian with SU(N) symmetry obeys SU(N)
symmetry, the ground state therefore belongs to this bosonic subsector.

We consider a system with N = Np fermionic flavors in L sites/modes. In particular, by considering the one
particle per flavor (1PF) sector, Nj = N2 =... = Ny = 1, the problem can be reinterpreted as N copies of a single
fermion of each flavor occupying one of the L sites. To establish the equivalence with bosons we are interested in
mimicking the bosonic Fock-space. This can be done by considering all combinations of fermionic flavor Fock states
that lead to a given total number of particles on each site. That is, we consider |n1,..., nL) F where np = a Nk
(it is allowed for nj, to be zero). Any such set contains numerous different Fock-space combinations denoted by the
11

index f (for example, a value of 2 on a site can be obtained by two particles AB, AC, BC, AD etc.). The number of
states corresponding to a given sum of particles on each site can be found using elementary combinatorics. First, we
chose n, flavors out of N. Next, we choose ng flavors out of N — 1 , etc. Each state within these sets is orthonormal,
and we can define their spans as the local Hilbert spaces for that particular number combination, with a dimension
given by the number of states in the combination

Bong = a (su)
ja nj!

Another set of orthonormal basis states can be obtained by taking the Fourier transform of these states, i.e.

So PRET Pla, cayman) p (S12)
f=0

As in the previous section the p = 0 state corresponds to a uniform superposition, now of all states with a given total
particle number on each site, i.e.

(S13)

This uniform superposition state is invariant under the exchange of any two flavors and therefore obeys the SU(N)
symmetry.

Our goal is to show that the matrix elements of the bosonic k-RDM and hence standard number-preserving Hamil-
tonians are embedded as a disconnected symmetry sector in the collective k-RDM defined in Eq.(S9), that is we need
to evaluate

(1, oes ML loPsucN) (lay es Ley M1; oy MR)|MAy os ML) p

We consider the case where an annihilation or creation operator is never used on the same site more than once first.
We will explain how allowing for multiple creation or annihilation operators on a single site would change the result
afterward. To proceed, we must evaluate the matrix elements inside the sum.

Non-zero matrix elements are unambiguously only obtained when n1, =m, +1, my, = Mm; — 1 and ny = ng where
q#mzj,l; for all 7. Any other combination would give zero due to the orthonormality of the Fock states. Additionally,
we see that an annihilation operator of a given flavor is always paired with a creation operator of the same flavor.
For any Fock state which has Nm; total number of particles on the site m,, there are exactly Mm; flavors represented
on the site and the same flavor cannot be present on any other site due to the 1PF sector restriction. Any of these
pairs of creation and annihilation operators of the same flavor therefore leads to exactly nm, candidates for non-zero
matrix-elements, each with a value of 1. From this, the sum over f’ for any matrix-element is given by Ts Nm;
These can then be taken outside the f sum since this value is solely determined by the total number of particles on
each site, which is always the same for a given choice of |n1,...,nz) and the specific indices of the k-RDM. This allows
12

us to evaluate the sum as

Here we know that ny = nq for any index q 4 m,,1;, which means that these terms cancel out in the fraction. This
means that only terms connected by the k-RDM remain in the fraction, and they can be evaluated as

This only holds if there are no multiple applications of creation/annihilation operators on the same site otherwise the
result is trivially modified. If there are k’ annihilation and/or k’ creation operators used on the same sites s and/or
r, respectively, the non-zero elements are now given by the restriction n/. =n, +k”, n’, =n, —k’, leading to a similar
update of the Kronecker delta. Additionally, once the annihilation operator has been applied once to a given site s
the created n, states each have the new occupation value n,—1, and this updated value must be used when the n, — 1
states are created by the next application of the annihilation operator. In this way, the expectation value is modified

If multiple s

‘es have the application of more than one creation or annihilation operator, the same modification has
to be made for each of these. In all cases, the p = 0 Fourier state leads to the same matrix-elements, obtained from
13

the equivalent bosonic k-RDM in the standard Bosonic Fock-space |n1,...,nz) and (nj, ...,n/,|. They obey the SU(V)
symmetry due to being a uniform superposition of all combinations. Additionally, we see that the k = 0 sector forms
a disconnected symmetry sector and any SU(N) fermionic Hamiltonian will therefore have the same energies in this
symmetry sector as the single-component bosonic Hamiltonian.

$3. Numerical representation of SU(N) utilizing matrix product states and tensor networks

In order to numerically investigate the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard model we utilize the ITensor library (See Ref. [48] in
the main text). Within the standard library the representation of spinless fermions and spinful electrons on a lattice
is already efficiently implemented. We therefore build on top of this and represent the N-component Hubbard model
in terms of these building blocks. For even N we utilize the two-component electron representation build into the
library with distinct sublattices corresponding to different flavors. For example the SU(6)-model is represented by
the one-dimensional Hamiltonian

where ji, pu’ =t,,. If we name the sublattices A,B,C the flavors correspond to A}, Aj, By, By,C,C,. The SU(4)-
model can be represented in a similar way, but is simpler as only two sublattices are required.

For the SU(3) calculations we utilize a system of spinless fermions with 3 sublattices that is the Hamiltonian is
given by

with the flavors corresponding to the A, B,C’ sublattices.
In order to efficiently apply the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition to the MPS representation of the wavefunction as a
series of gates Tj ;1 we use use fermionic swap-gates to exchange neighboring sites.
