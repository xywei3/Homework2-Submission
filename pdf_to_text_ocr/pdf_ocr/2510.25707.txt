Abstract

Hydrogen hydrates (HH) are a unique class of materials composed of hydrogen molecules
confined within crystalline water frameworks. Among their multiple phases, the filled
ice structures, particularly the cubic C2 phase, exhibit exceptionally strong host-guest
interactions due to ultra-short H7-H20 distances and a 1:1 stoichiometry leading to two
interpenetrated identical diamond-like sublattices, one comprised of water molecules, the
other of hydrogen molecules. At high pressures, nuclear quantum effects involving both
hydrogen molecules and the water lattice become dominant, giving rise to a dual-lattice
quantum system. In this work, we explore the sequence of pressure- and temperature-
driven phase transitions in HH, focusing on the interplay between molecular rotation,
orientational ordering, lattice symmetry breaking and hydrogen bond symmetrization.
Using a combination of computational modeling based on classical and path-integral
molecular dynamics, quantum embedding, and high pressure experiments, including
Raman spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray diffraction at low temperatures and high
pressures, we identify signatures of quantum-induced ordering and structural transfor-
mations in the C2 phase. Our findings reveal that orientational ordering in HH occurs at
much lower pressures than in solid hydrogen, by inducing structural changes in the water
network and enhancing the coupling of water and hydrogen dynamics. This work provides
new insights into the quantum behavior of hydrogen under extreme mechanochemical
confinement and establishes hydrogen-filled ices as a promising platform for the design
of hydrogen-rich quantum materials.
The rotational dynamics of guest gas molecules confined in porous materials are
profoundly influenced by their local environment [1]. In large, nearly spherical cages, guest
species often behave as nearly free rotors [2-4]. In contrast, low-symmetry or anisotropic
environments impose steric constraints that hinder rotation, leading to librational motions
or even complete orientational freezing [5-7].

Such effects have been extensively studied in clathrate hydrates, where the host-guest
potential not only quantizes the center-of-mass motion but can also induce partial orien-
tational ordering at low temperatures and high pressures [5, 8-10]. Zeolite frameworks,
with their inherent anisotropy and stronger host-guest interactions, exhibit similar be-
havior: small guest molecules often display restricted rotational freedom and develop
orientational preferences within the channels or cages [11-15]. Endohedral fullerenes
offer a particularly clean example of quantum confinement: molecules such as Hy and
CH, confined inside C¢o exhibit discrete quantum rotational states that are exquisitely
sensitive to cage symmetry and weak van der Waals interactions [6, 16, 17]. These sys-
tems provide compelling evidence of how confinement and symmetry shape quantum
rotational behavior across a wide range of host architectures.

In gas-filled ice structures under high pressure [18], the extreme confinement imposed
by the ice hosting lattice leads to the suppression of molecular rotations even at high
temperatures, enabling the onset of orientational ordering of guest molecules [19-21]. In
certain cases, this ordering is accompanied by molecular distortion [20], and can even
trigger symmetry-lowering transitions in the host lattice itself [22, 23]. These phenomena
underscore the unique interplay between quantum confinement and structural flexibility
in filled-ice systems—an interplay rarely observed in classical porous materials.

Among these, hydrogen hydrates (HH)—where hydrogen molecules are encapsulated
within an extended water lattice—stand out as a particularly rich system for exploring
host-guest interactions under extreme thermodynamic conditions. HH comprises five
well-characterized phases. The first, i.e., the clathrate structure sII, contains hydrogen
molecules trapped in large polyhedral cages within a hydrogen-bonded water network
[3, 24]. The other four—C0, C1, C2, and C3—are filled-ice structures in which hydrogen
molecules occupy interstitial voids within compact ice-like frameworks. Specifically, CO
adopts the open-channel ice XVII topology [25], Cl corresponds to the layered ice II
structure [26], while C2 and C3 are based on the cubic ice (Ic) framework [27].

While sII is only stable at cryogenic temperatures, both C1 and C2 persist at room
temperature under high pressure. C1 is stable between 0.9 and 2.7 GPa (and metastable up
to 5.2 GPa), whereas C2 stabilizes above 2.7 GPa and transforms into C3 at temperatures
above 670 K and pressures above 30 GPa. C3 remains stable up to at least 90 GPa and can
be recovered metastably down to 7 GPa [23].

Among these phases, C2 is particularly intriguing. It adopts a topology analogous
to that of ice VII, consisting of two interpenetrating but non-interconnected diamond-
like sublattices. However, unlike ice VII—where both sublattices are composed of water
molecules—in C2, one sublattice is entirely formed by hydrogen molecules. This breaks
the structural equivalence, lowers the overall symmetry, and results in a unique dual-
framework architecture. Remarkably, C2 exhibits the shortest known Hj-H)0 distances
among hydrogen hydrates, and its 1:1 stoichiometry gives rise to exceptionally strong
host-guest interactions.

Under such extreme densities confinement effects predominate, affecting not only
the hydrogen molecules within their sublattice but also the protons constituting the ice
framework. As pressure increases, the distinction between host and guest progressively
diminishes, and the system is more appropriately described as two equivalent, interpene-
trating quantum lattices of distinct species: Hz and H20.

The rotational dynamics of hydrogen in hydrogen-filled ices are strongly pressure- and
temperature-dependent. Increasing pressure and lowering temperature progressively
restrict guest rotation, inducing stepwise orientational ordering [28], analogous to effects
seen in solid methane [29, 30] and solid hydrogen [31-33], where intermolecular inter-
actions produce roton band splittings. Similar but stronger effects occur in hydrogen
clathrates [10].

In the C2 phase, first-principles calculations predicted a pressure-induced cubic-to-
tetragonal distortion at low temperature via hydrogen alignment along the c-axis [34],
confirmed in D20-D» by XRD peak splitting and roton band splitting above 20 GPa at 10 K
[35]. Additional high-pressure phases (HH-HP1 at 40 GPa and HH-HP2 at 60 GPa) involve
further orientational ordering and possible hydrogen-bond symmetrization [35-37].

Our recent work refined this phase diagram: we observed tetragonal distortion of C2
above 30 GPa at room temperature, amorphization above 60 GPa, and transformation to
C3 upon laser heating [23, 27]. We also determined that hydrogen-bond symmetrization
occurs at 26 GPa—much lower than in ice VII—due to shorter O-O distances in the cubic
ice Ic framework [38].

In the present work, we go beyond these macroscopic observations to elucidate their
microscopic origin: we demonstrate that hydrogen-bond symmetrization in the water
lattice triggers the nematic alignment of the H» sublattice, and that this collective orienta-
tional ordering, in turn, drives the tetragonal distortion of the host framework. By disen-
tangling this sequence of coupled events, we establish the microscopic mechanism linking
proton symmetrization, guest orientational order, and host lattice deformation in C2. We
probe these phase transitions via combined ab initio simulations, low-temperature Ra-
man spectroscopy, and synchrotron XRD [39-43], highlighting how enhanced host-guest
coupling under pressure suppresses rotational freedom and stabilizes orientational order
at much lower pressures than in pure hydrogen.

Results and Discussion

Figure 1 presents the pressure-temperature phase diagram constructed from our com-
bined computational and experimental approaches, with the thermodynamic paths probed
experimentally summarized in Table 1. Within the C2 phase, Hz exhibits three distinct
regimes, dictated by temperature and the degree of coupling with the surrounding water
lattice.

At high temperatures and pressures below 30 GPa (above the dashed line) the Hz
sublattice in Hy hydrate realizes a quantum plastic crystal. In this state, the Hy molecules
are ordered on a diamond-type lattice, defining well-localized translational equilibrium
sites, yet their orientations remain dynamically disordered [44]. Each Hz behaves as a
nearly free quantum rotor, i.e., the rotational degrees of freedom are not frozen but
remain active down to relatively low temperatures due to quantum fluctuations. This
combination of translational order and orientational quantum mobility is the defining
feature of a quantum plastic phase. In contrast, the water sublattice is proton-disordered
but not plastic, since the orientations of HzO molecules are constrained by the ice rules
and do not undergo free rotational dynamics. The overall symmetry of the crystal is cubic,
consistent with previous DFT predictions and experimental observations [23, 27, 34].

Upon crossing the dashed boundary, either through temperature reduction or com-
pression, Hz molecules undergo orientational ordering. At high pressure this results in a
phase where Hy are aligned along the c axis of the crystal. This ordering transition can
be quantified by the orientation factor S (See Methods) computed based on our quantum
embedded calculations as described in the following, and visualized as a color gradient in
Fig. 1. The factor S, which ranges from 0 (complete orientational disorder) to 1 (perfect
alignment), measures the collective alignment of the hydrogen molecules along the c axis
of the crystal, capturing both the orientational order imposed by the lattice geometry and
the intrinsic thermal quantum fluctuations encoded in the density matrix.

Within the orientationally ordered phase—occurring below 30 GPa and 100 K—H2
molecules adopt a herringbone-like arrangement, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1. This
configuration favors alignment along the crystalline c axis. The tilt angle of the molecules
relative to the c axis varies continuously with pressure, reflecting the energetically favor-
able response to lattice compression at low temperatures. As pressure increases, the tilt
angle gradually decreases, approaching full alignment along the c axis, i.e the nematic
phase. This progressive reorientation is also captured by the pressure dependence of the
orientation factor S in Fig. 1.

The low-temperature, high-pressure phases (< 50 GPa) of Hz and D2 are unique molecu-
lar systems in which free rotations are governed by both quantum effects and temperature
[45]. Molecular hydrogen occurs in two nuclear-spin isomers, both partially occupied at
ambient conditions. When the proton spins couple to the singlet state with total nuclear-
spin quantum number J = 0, defined by J = J, + do, where J, = do = ¥ are the proton
resolved nuclear spins, the resulting para-hydrogen possesses an antisymmetric spin
wavefunction and, to satisfy overall fermionic antisymmetry, its spatial part is restricted
to even rotational quantum numbers |. Coupling the same proton spins to the triplet state
(J = 1) produces ortho-hydrogen, whose symmetric spin wavefunction permits only odd |
values.

At low pressures, Raman spectra of solid hydrogen and clathrates [4, 10, 27, 46, 47]
display free-rotor peaks with energies E, = rl +1) where I is the moment of inertia of
the rotor and / the angular momentum, with selection rule Al = +2. In the free molecule,
rotational levels are (21+ 1)-fold degenerate, and the main gas-phase Raman bands are
So(0) (l = 0 > 2) (354 cm!) and So(1) (1 = 1 > 3) (587 cm™4) [46, 48]. In the clathrate
phase and in low-pressure filled ice CO and C1 phases, the rotor bands remain close to
the free-rotor values and their degeneracy is preserved. In the high-pressure C2 phase,
however, the anisotropic crystal field lifts this degeneracy and shifts the main ortho-para
transition band by 4 meV—about 30% of its value [49]. With increasing pressure, these
bands broaden, making individual rotational levels increasingly difficult to resolve.

Figure 2a,b shows the evolution of the Raman intensity distribution among the S,(0)
transitions in a gas-loaded hydrogen hydrate sample (see Methods) as a function of temper-
ature and pressure. XRD confirmed phase-pure C2 after gas loading, whereas cryo-loaded
samples contained 83 mol% HO due to decomposition of the sII substrate (6:1 H20:H2
stoichiometry).

At low temperatures, the S9(2) and So(3) bands weaken and vanish below 150 K due
to thermal depopulation of higher rotational levels; in pure hydrogen, these disappear
at 120 K (3 GPa) [50]. In the compressed hydrate, the Raman evolution is more complex:
a sudden broadening and asymmetry around 30 GPa suggest a change in the rotational

state of encapsulated Hy [46, 51], likely driven by modifications to the crystalline field
from the surrounding water framework during its transition to a less compressible phase
[23]. The instability of C2 above 20 GPa toward decomposition into ice VII and molecular
hydrogen [37] may also contribute to inhomogeneous Raman signals from free H2. The
intensity oscillations reported near 20 GPa [37] were not observed here; spectra were
consistently collected from the same spot after each pressure step, with a 30-minute
equilibration, ensuring that the observed increases in the So(1)/S9(0) intensity ratio upon
cooling (14.7 GPa) and compression (300 K) reflect enhanced ortho-para conversion. Both
high pressure and low temperature are known to facilitate this process in solid hydrogen
[46, 51].

XRD measurements reveal that either cooling below 150 K at 2.45 GPa or compress-
ing above 27 GPa at RT induces peak splitting (Fig. 2c—h), signaling a cubic (Fd3m) to
tetragonal (14,/amd) transition. Although the splitting pattern is similar in both cases, it
is markedly sharper and an order of magnitude larger under compression. The pressure-
driven transition begins abruptly at around 30 GPa, coinciding with the onset of Raman
anomalies—evidence of coupling between H) rotational dynamics and framework distor-
tion. In both scenarios (cooling and pressurization), the c axis stiffens while the orthogonal
directions contract (Fig. 2i,k). The distortion, quantified as c/\/2a, increases smoothly,
reaching 0.5% at 30 K (2.45 GPa) and 4.6% at 48 GPa (300 K) (Fig. 2j,1).

To probe the molecular-scale mechanism linking proton alignment to the lattice
distortions seen in XRD, we performed simulations of a crystal-embedded H» molecule by
solving the Schrédinger equation with an effective potential corresponding to the crystal
field generated by the water framework and surrounding H2 molecules. Figure 3(a-b)
shows the evolution of Hy density isosurfaces with temperature and pressure, along with
the angular component P;,, (8, ) of the external potential Vext(r, 0, &) = R(r) + P;(8, b)
at the equilibrium H» bond length r = req. 0 and ¢ are respectively the polar and azimuthal
angles of the molecular orientation in a cubic lattice reference. As described in Methods
and Supporting Information, densities at a given T are obtained from the para and ortho
thermal density matrices mixed together with a fixed 1:3 para-ortho ratio.

At low pressure (P = 3 GPa, panel 3(a)), the external angular potential exhibits minima
that force the molecules into a herringbone-like arrangement. As T increases within the C2
stability range, para- and ortho-wavefunctions mix and the density approaches spherical
symmetry. With increasing pressure, intermolecular interactions intensify and potential
barriers rise, while the minima shift toward 0 = 0 [7], ultimately favoring full nematicity.
At room temperature (panel 3(b)), the density evolves from nearly spherical shells at 10
GPa—characteristic of the quantum-plastic phase—to well-defined lobes aligned with the
c-axis at 50 GPa.

The eigenvalue evolution shown in Fig.3(c) demonstrates how the anisotropic crystal
field in the C2 phase lifts the free-rotor degeneracy and induces a pressure-dependent
giant splitting, in agreement with earlier findings [49]. This quantum mechanical picture

gap between the fundamental para state (/ = 0) and the three ortho states (1 = 1, Ay, Az, A3)
enables thermal mixing above ~100 K, yielding nearly spherical densities. Increasing
pressure drives a sharp rise in the splitting between A, and A2 3, bringing the A level close

producing a nematic density distribution. The fixed 1:3 para-ortho ratio further enhances
the statistical weight of A;, stabilizing orientational order up to ~500 K (Fig.3d-e).

From these computed eigenvalues, we can determine the Stokes rotational transitions
So(0) and So(1), plotted in Fig. 4(a) as orange and blue curves, respectively. The comparison
with the experimental Raman data in the same panel shows good agreement, particularly
in the pressure evolution of the main features, thus validating the simulation framework.
The pronounced change in slope of both Sp(0) and So(1) near 30 GPa coincides with the
cubic-tetragonal distortion observed in XRD and with the calculated onset of dominant

driven by a pressure-induced orientational ordering of the guest molecules.

a D»-hydrate (wp,). At low pressure, the ratio remains close to the free-rotor limit of 2,

tion relative to the host cages. As rotational freedom is quenched, the excitations acquire
librational character and the ratio approaches the harmonic mass-scaling limit \/2, char-

acteristic of an oscillator with frequency « m2

. A qualitatively similar evolution has
been reported for pure solid hydrogen and deuterium at much higher pressures (above
~140 GPa) [46, 48], and a direct comparison between the dispersion curves for the hydrate
and for the elemental solids is provided in the Supplementary Information (Fig. A6). In
analogy with the dense elemental phases, if the hindering potential in the hydrate is
sufficiently anharmonic — i.e. weaker than purely harmonic at large angular displace-
ments — the ratio can transiently overshoot below V2 before converging, reflecting an
enhanced softening of the librational mode. Notably, the roton-libron crossover in the hy-
drate occurs at pressures an order of magnitude lower than in pure hydrogen/deuterium,
highlighting the much stronger orientational constraints imposed by the host lattice. The
observed trend thus constitutes direct spectroscopic evidence for the progressive locking
of the guest-rotor orientation due to the strengthening of H2/D2-H2O coupling under
pressure.

This progressive hindering of the guest rotations revealed in panel 4(b) has a direct
counterpart in the behavior of the intramolecular H-H stretching mode, since changes in
rotational freedom modify the coupling between rotational and vibrational degrees of
freedom and thus the vibron pressure dependence. Consequently, from the analysis of
the H-H stretching mode in Fig. 4(c) comparing Density Functional Perturbation Theory

(DFPT) calculations with experimental Raman frequencies it turns out that both simulation
and experiment display a clear change in slope near 30 GPa. This is consistent with the
signatures seen in the rotational modes and further linking the vibron behavior to the
onset of pressure-induced orientational ordering predicted by our quantum embedded
model.

The structure of the C2 hydrogen hydrate at low pressure is shown in Fig.5(a). The
two interpenetrating hydrogen and water cubic sublattices are fully orientationally disor-
dered: the protons in the water framework are randomly distributed between equivalent
hydrogen-bond configurations, and the Hz molecules adopt random orientations within
their cages. Panel 5(b) reports the evolution with pressure of the positions of the two
oxygen atoms closest to a given water proton Hy—the intramolecular oxygen covalently
bound to Hy and the oxygen of the neighboring molecule to which Hy is hydrogen-
bonded—shown in blue, as extracted from our Path-Integral Molecular Dynamics (PIMD)
trajectories (see Methods). With increasing pressure, these two nearest oxygen atoms
approach to each other and their corresponding distances to Hw converge at ~26 GPa
[38], indicating proton symmetrization and the formation of symmetric O - H---O bonds.
The first peak position of the oxygen-oxygen (0-0) radial distribution function is shown
in black, while the background color encodes the orientation factor Spyyp of the Hz
molecules, computed from path-integral molecular dynamics as an ensemble average
over beads and time steps, as defined in Methods. This quantity implicitly incorporates
both the geometrical arrangement of the molecules and their thermal-quantum fluctua-
tions relative to the c axis. Before symmetrization, compression primarily shortens the
hydrogen bonds, with little ordering of the Hz sublattice. Proton symmetrization abruptly
stiffens the O— H---O network, producing a sharp increase in the bulk modulus B [23, 27]
and making the ice sublattice much less compressible. Beyond this point, further isotropic
compression is energetically disfavored; instead, it becomes more favorable to reorient
the Hz molecules with their bond axes parallel to the c direction [panel 5(c)], reducing
the volume along a and b owing to the increased compressibility along these axes. This
collective alignment of the Hy sublattice drives the tetragonal elongation of the H,0
framework and produces a second, more gradual rise in B [23, 27]. In other words, the
lattice first complies with increased pressure through hydrogen-bond rigidification in
the water network, and then through anisotropic reorientation of the hydrogen network,
rather than by further reducing the O - O separation. Figure 5 thus reveals a two-stage
process in which the quantum-mechanical behavior of the water and hydrogen sublattices
becomes tightly interlocked, their structural and dynamical degrees of freedom evolving
in unison and merging into a single quantum lattice.

Our results demonstrate that C2 hydrogen hydrate undergoes a pressure-driven, two-
stage transformation in which the hindering of the rotational dynamics of the hydro-

11
gen sublattice becomes intertwined with the distortion of the ice sublattice. The first
stage—proton symmetrization in the host lattice—abruptly stiffens the hydrogen-bond
network, while the second—anisotropic alignment of the Hz molecules—relieves further
compression and induces a tetragonal distortion. This collective alignment is directly man-
ifested in the structural transition of the lattice, marking the point where the guest reorien-
tation and host deformation proceed in lockstep. The coupling is evident across structural,
elastic, rotational, and vibrational observables, linking the roton-libron crossover of the
guest molecules to the proton ordering of the host. In this regime, the motions of the
host lattice and the guest molecules become strongly interconnected, forming collective
quantum modes rather than distinct subsystems. This provides an exquisite example of
coupled nuclear quantum dynamics in a crystalline solid, with potential implications for
other hydrogen-rich materials under high pressure.

Methods

Experimental Details

Samples were prepared in two different ways, depending on the specific experiment,
cryo-loaded or gas-loaded in the diamond anvil cell (DAC). In the first case, polycrystalline
hydrogen hydrate samples with the sII clathrate structure were prepared by exposing
H20 ice (Ih) to gas Hz at 0.28 GPa for 20-30 min, following the method described in ref.
[3]. The ice was made of spheres with typical diameters of a few tens of micrometers.
After preparation, the samples were recovered at ambient pressure and stored at liquid
nitrogen temperature. Then, a small amount of sample was loaded at liquid nitrogen
temperature into a diamond anvil cell partially immersed in a liquid nitrogen bath and in
an atmosphere saturated with nitrogen vapor to avoid water or oxygen condensation on
the culet. The loaded samples were then compressed to pressures of a few GPa before
being warmed to room temperature. This is a similar loading procedure to what we
had previously done for methane hydrate [20, 22]. This procedure inevitably produces
a mixture of C2 hydrogen hydrate and excess pure ice, due to the difference in molar
ratios between the clathrate sII phase and the C2 phase. Clathrate sII samples prepared
following our method have a molar ratio H2O:H2 between 4 and 5, as we have verified by
neutron diffraction in the past [3], and the C2 phase is characterized by a molar ratio of 1.
Two samples were prepared directly in the DAC by loading room-temperature liquid H20
and high-pressure Hp using a gas loading setup. Briefly, liquid water was loaded together
with an air bubble, consisting of approximately 70% of the sample chamber volume. The
air bubble was replaced with 99.99+% Hy» at 1400 bar, and the DAC was subsequently
pneumatically closed and pressurized. These samples were measured by both Raman
spectroscopy and by XRD. Some of the cryoloaded samples contained a small amount of

12
pure N» and/or pure Op, both of which can easily be identified from their respective vibron
Raman peaks. They were trapped in the sample chamber during cryoloading and would
have acted as a pressure-transmitting medium. In the gas-loaded samples, Hp itself was
acting as the pressure transmitting medium. Culet diameters ranging between 200-500
um for the Ilas quality diamond anvils were used. Re-foil gaskets were used to contain the
sample whilst ruby and/or gold spheres were used as pressure calibrants in Raman and
X-ray experiments respectively.

Angle-dispersive X-ray powder diffraction patterns were acquired at ID15b at ESRF
(Grenoble, France) using a monochromatic X-ray beam (A=0.41 A) and an Eiger 2 9M CdTe
flat-panel detector, with a typical acquisition time of a ten seconds.[43] The beam spot
size was 6x6 um, and the DAC was rocked 5° during the acquisition. The 2D diffraction
patterns were treated to mask the Bragg peaks of the diamond anvils, then integrated
into one-dimensional patterns, and a smooth polynomial background was subtracted.
Le Bail refinements were performed using Topas Academic version 6 [52]. In the XRD
measurements, the pressure was determined using the equation of state of gold from ref.
[53]. Raman spectra at ambient temperature were acquired using a commercial Horiba
Jobin-Yvon LabRam HR800 Raman spectrometer in a backscattering geometry, equipped
with a COBOLT SambaTM green 532 nm laser, with a nominal power of 1000 mW. Low-
temperature Raman spectra were collected using an Argon laser (120 mW output power)
tuned to 514.32 nm and a Peltier-cooled HR460 spectrograph with 1500 gr/mm grating. The
acquisition time was typically about a minute. Reference spectra were recorded at each
pressure from the gasket close to the sample chamber, and particular care was taken to
check the effect of the background subtraction on the fit results. In the Raman measure-
ments, pressure was determined by the shift of the R1 ruby fluorescence line [54], from
the edge of the stressed diamond signal (above 40 GPa) [55], or from the vibron frequency
of pure solid Hz [56]. A helium cryostat was used for low-temperature measurements.

Computational Details

Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were carried out on a 2 x 2 x 2 super-
cell of the C2 phase (space group Pna2 ) over a grid of pressures from 3 to 50 GPa and
temperatures from 25 to 300 K. Calculations employed the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof
(PBE) exchange-correlation functional [57] and were performed with both VASP [58] and
Quantum Espresso [59, 60] packages. The Path-Integral molecular dynamics approach
(PIMD) [61-65] was used to efficiently sample nuclear-quantum effects under the desired
thermodynamic conditions. Simulations were conducted for temperatures above 25 K, by
using the Path-Integral Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Dynamics (PIOUD) algorithm implemented
in Quantum Espresso [66]. After performing convergence tests on both the virial and prim-
itive estimators of the quantum kinetic energy, the number of beads (N;) was set to 40 at

13
300 K and increased to 160 at 25 K for PIMD runs. For both AIMD and PIMD, a plane-wave
cutoff of 100 Ry and a 2 x 2 x 2 k-point mesh were sufficient to achieve convergence in the
DFT solution of the electronic problem. Trajectories were obtained with a time-step of 0.5
fs and a total duration of approximately 10 ps for each (P, T) condition.

Spin isomers such as ortho- and para- hydrogen are not taken into account in molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations. Indeed, to access the true low-temperature physics of the C2
phase while retaining quantum effects and accounting for spin isomers, we solved the
Schrodinger equation at 0 K for an Hy molecule in an effective potential modeling the
induced interactions between H» and the water lattice. As detailed in the Supplementary
Information section A, going beyond previous studies [67-70], we evaluated the full, non-
separable potential Vext(r, 8, @) by performing self-consistent DFT calculations (Quantum
Espresso, 300 eV cutoff, 5x4x5 k-mesh) for each configuration generated on a dense spher-
ical grid of bond lengths and orientations [70]. These 0 K DFT energies directly capture the
interaction of Hy with the water lattice. We used several exchange-correlation functionals
and their comparison is shown in Fig. Al. For consistency with the MD calculations, the
main results are obtained using PBE.

The Schrodinger equation has been solved using a basis set of the form 1p"(r, 0, @) =
xn(7)¥7"(0, &), where x;,(r) is the radial basis of the Morse potential and Y/"(0, p) are
the spherical harmonics. This approach can be viewed as a mean-field model, in which a
single Hy molecule is embedded in the field generated by the surrounding water lattice.

The spatial density at finite temperature T was obtained by treating the two nuclear-
spin manifolds of Hy independently. Assuming that ortho (J=1) and para (J=0) popula-
tions do not interconvert on the time scale of the simulation, the total density reads

—B (Ej-E})
foe Phi -£) foe jE
et) = 2 hh) pl) P
icortho jepara P
where
Z=- > eB (EE) B= >d eB (Ej-BG)
icortho jepara

Here B = (kgT)~}, |p|? and Ep are the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues obtained from
the Schrodinger equation evaluated in the relaxed hydrate lattice; E} and ES are the ortho
and para ground-state energies, and f p: f. =1:3 is the fixed statistical spin ratio. This
approach neglects cage deformation effects, as the potential is evaluated using the relaxed
lattice geometry. A key advantage of the embedded quantum model is that it naturally
incorporates the correct ortho/para mixture of Hy. In contrast, PIMD simulations describe
only the para state (the ground rotational state), while in reality the ortho species is more
populated than the para one in a 3:1 ratio. Because the ortho states are more localized than
the para state, this difference has a major impact on orientational properties, particularly

14
at the lowest temperatures. Accounting for the ortho/para mixture is therefore essential
for a quantitatively accurate description of the orientational regimes and phase transitions.
Another clear advantage of the quantum embedded model is the possibility to explore low-
temperature regimes at constant computational effort, compared to PIMD whose effort
increases dramatically as temperature is lowered. We therefore adopted the quantum
embedded model as viable approach to study the quantum phase diagram of hydrogen
filled ice as a function of pressure and temperature.

To characterize the three distinct orientational regimes for Hy (quantum plastic,
herringbone-like configurations, and nematicity [27, 34]) from the quantum embedded
model, we introduce the orientation factor S as follows [71, 72].

In analogy with diffraction theory, where the scattering amplitude can be factorized
into a lattice contribution and a local form factor, we define the orientation factor as the
product of a collective geometric term and an intrinsic quantum factor:

(1) S(P, T) = Sg(P) Sq(P, T).

The geometric contribution S¢ is evaluated on the 0 K equilibrium geometry obtained
from DFT calculations at a given pressure P. It is defined from the orientation of each
molecule i, through the angle 0; between the crystallographic c axis (preferential axis
of alignment) and the molecular axis. Its definition coincides with the nematic order
parameter [73, 74]:

i1N2  o,. 1
2 S, =—) a a?
(2) & wala 1 5)

This factor thus encodes the collective orientational arrangement of the atomic sites. By
construction, Sg = 1 when all Hz molecular axes are perfectly aligned along the crystallo-
graphic c axis, while Sp = 0 corresponds to a completely random, isotropic distribution of
the molecular orientations in the simulation cell.

We then apply a quantum dressing to this geometric factor, obtained from the probability
density of the quantum embedded model at pressure P and temperature T. For this purpose,
we define the alignment tensor

(3) Q,= 5 [ o(t) uur de 51,

where ur is the unit vector along r, and p(r) is the diagonal part of the thermal density
matrix. We define the quantum contribution S, as the largest eigenvalue of Q,. By construc-
tion, Sg = 1 when the quantum distribution of the Hz molecular axes is perfectly aligned
along a given direction while Sg = 0 corresponds to an isotropic quantum distribution.
This quantum dressing ensures that the final orientation factor incorporates both the

15
orientation linked to the underlying geometry (Sg) and the intrinsic thermal quantum
fluctuations encoded in the density matrix (Sq), in the same way as diffraction separates
lattice geometry from the internal structure of the scatterer.

With this definition, the orientation factor S(P, T) can be mapped across the phase
diagram, as shown in Fig. 1.

S(P, T) can also be computed from PIMD simulations at pressure P and temperature T,
whenever available, instead of the quantum embedded model. In this case, the orientation
factor reads Spy = f dX p(X) NN; Sea 3 cos? 0;(X) - 3), where the integral runs over
the path configurations X, and the sum runs over all N Hp molecules and the beads. Here,
p(X) denotes the normalized configurational probability density sampled during the
path-integral molecular dynamics, so that the integral represents an ensemble average
over beads and time steps. Notice how the latter equation contains implicitly both a
geometrical contribution, given by the orientational arrangement of the Hy molecules in
the supercell, and thermal-quantum fluctuations, provided by the path-integral formalism.
The orientation factor obtained from the PIMD simulations Spyyp at 300K is plotted in
Fig. 5, by neglecting spin isomers effects and relying on the similar density distribution of
the J = 0 and J = 1 states at room temperature.

To locate the transition between the quantum plastic and orientationally ordered
phases, we employ a complementary global order parameter Miot. It is defined as a
structure-factor measure of orientational coherence, constructed from angular phases
chosen such that symmetry-related orientations (phase/antiphase configurations, e.g. in
the herringbone pattern) interfere constructively. Randomly oriented Hy molecules then
cancel out (Miot ¥ 0), while herringbone or nematic Hp molecules add coherently (Mtot *
1). The precise mathematical definition, including the angular cumulative distribution
function transforms and rank-m order parameters, is given in Section B of the SI. In
molecular dynamics trajectories sampled over the (P, T) grid, orientational transitions
are identified by the vanishing of Mtot, which signals the loss of orientational order in the
Hp sublattice. For each pressure, the temperature at which Mtot vanishes is referenced as
the transition point.

Since Mtot cannot be evaluated within the quantum embedded model, which describes
individually embedded Hz, we instead compute the global order parameter from clas-
sical MD simulations. At the classical transition points, we evaluate the corresponding
orientation factors, where this time thermal quantum fluctuations in Eq. 3 are replaced
by a thermal average performed over the classical canonical ensemble in the simulation
cell. Within the approximation of dominant electrostatic effects, the resulting ensemble-
averaged value of S at the classical transition points provides a threshold, sth, for the
critical value of S computed with the quantum embedded model. Within the embed-
ded framework, the transition temperature Tp at pressure P is then obtained from the

16
condition
S(P, Tp) = st

Plotting Tp as a function of pressure gives the points of the white dashed transition line
shown in Fig.1. The error bars on Tp are obtained by propagating the uncertainty in sth: we
evaluate the inverse relation at the two bounds S = S“ + ae, The temperature uncertainty
is then defined as AT = 2\Thigh ~ Trowl) Where Thigh (Tyo) Corresponds to the temperature
extracted from the inverse map at the S‘* + ot! (st — ot?) bound (see Fig. A4 of SI).

Finally, because Sg is computed with respect to the c axis in Eq. 2, the orientation factor
also provides direct information on the nematic orientation of the system, the largest
values of S being taken in the nematic aligned phase.

The phonon spectrum and Raman cross section of the system were computed using
density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) as implemented in the Quantum ESPRESSO
package [75, 76], employing a unit cell and a 4x4x4 k-point grid. This is the only calculation
performed entirely within a classical nuclear framework, as no implementation currently
exists for computing Raman cross sections from PIMD trajectories.

To investigate the relationship between Hp orientational order, HyO-Hy interactions,
and proton symmetrization within the water sublattice, the radial distribution functions
g(r) as a function of pressure were computed from our MD trajectories for Hw-O, H,-0,
and O-0 pairs. Here, Hw denotes protons belonging to the water sublattice, H;, refers to
protons from Hz molecules, and O represents oxygen atoms.

Supplementary Information A. Quantum solution of the embedded H>
molecule in the crystal field

Building upon the method described in the Supplementary Material of Ref.[70], we evalu-
ated the full, non-separable external potential Vext(r, 8, @) and solved the corresponding
Schrédinger equation for the quantum embedded H» molecule where r is the Hz molecule
elongation, 0 is the polar and ¢ the azimuthal angles describing the molecule orientation
(see Fig. A2).

Quantum embedding leads to a system of quantum rigid rotor in an effective potential
representing an isolated Hz in the C2 phase. The associated Schrodinger equation reads:

ve - -
(-E + Vexe) WC) = ey(F),
2u
where p = ode! is the reduced mass, with my the mass of a hydrogen atom. Since

: , we
Vext # 0, the energy levels deviate from those of a free rotor, given by E; = apt 1), where

I = 1 R? is the moment of inertia and lis the angular momentum quantum number.

The external potential takes the form Vext = Vprr(7) = V(r, 9, ) = R(r) + P;(0, o).
The potential has been computed numerically from the DFT-relaxed structure of the C2
hydrogen hydrate, using several DFT functionals reported in Fig. Al. A script generated
all configurations on a spherical coordinate grid with a fixed center of mass, varying the
bond length r and orientation angles 0 and ¢. The grid used has dimensions n, x ng x Ny =
64 x 32 x 32.

As in Ref.[70], a self-consistent DFT calculation was performed in the primitive unit
cell for each configuration. Since the simulations are carried out at OK, the resulting total
energies represent the potential experienced by the Hz molecule around the classical
equilibrium geometry. These calculations were performed with Quantum Espresso [59, 60],
on a k grid of 5x4x5 and a plane-waves expansion cut at 300 eV.

The radial part of the potential R(r) is fitted using a Morse function, while the angular
component is interpolated linearly between the computed data points. After having deter-
mined numerically the effective potential Vext, we solved the corresponding Schrodinger
equation numerically using the Lanczos algorithm in shift-invert mode, following the
approach of Ref.[70]. At variance with Ref.[70], in the present case we took into account the
full 3D potential in a non-separable form, by developing the Hamiltonian matrix elements
on a basis set of the type wn(r, 0, b) = xn(r) ¥7"(8, ). Here, xn(r) are the eigenfunctions
of the Morse potential obtained by solving the one-dimensional Schrodinger equation for
the fitted radial part, and yi"(0, #) are spherical harmonics, which form a complete basis

24
set for the angular part of a free quantum rotor.

Ap mtm(1), where the angular coupling coefficient is defined as:

Apmiim(?) = [ AQ. Yf"* (8, ) Pr(8, b) ¥7"(8, 0).

All matrix elements can be computed numerically based on the evaluated potential
and the chosen basis. The angular integrals Ay ,1,,(r) are evaluated on the r-grid and
interpolated accordingly.

Our method is compared to that of Ref. [70] in Fig. Al. When the full, non-separable
potential is taken into account, the energy level splitting is reduced compared to the
separated approach (PBE separated vs. PBE), where the radial and angular parts are
integrated independently. This difference is due to a more accurate treatment of the
interaction potential in the present formalism.

We also investigated the impact of the exchange-correlation functional within our
method. The use of vdW-DF leads to results that are in better agreement with experiment
than those obtained with PBE for DFT energy estimation, consistent with previous findings
[77]. Since vdW-DF tends to slightly overestimate the lattice parameters, we computed
the eigenvalues using the experimental volume at 3 GPa. As expected, a slight increase in
the splitting is observed compared to the standard vdW-DF calculation. This is consistent
with the pressure dependence of the splitting, as shown in Fig. 3 (c).

Next, we evaluated the influence of proton disorder on the eigenvalues. To do this, we
generated external potentials for a set of proton-disordered configurations that satisfy the
ice rules. These potentials exhibit significant variations in magnitude. For each configura-
tion, the corresponding eigenvalues were computed and the average is obtained using an
arithmetic mean. As shown in Fig. A1, this leads to a substantial reduction in the energy
level splitting, bringing it closer to the experimental values. This reduction is attributed
to the decrease in anisotropy of the effective potential when proton disorder is included.

Incorporating all these effects—namely, the use of vdW-DF and averaging over multiple
proton-disordered structures—significantly increases the computational cost. In this work,
our aim is to provide insight into the orientational transitions and the coupling between the
Hy and H20 sublattices, as well as to highlight the role of quantum effects. Furthermore,
since both the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and path-integral molecular dynamics
simulations were carried out using the PBE functional due to computational cost, all

quantum embedded calculations shown in the main paper have been performed with the
same functional and in the proton-ordered configuration (i.e., the ice VIII sub-lattice) for
consistency and direct comparison.

Supplementary Information B. Order parameter

The orientational order of the H sub-lattice is monitored through a global order parameter.
Figure A2 (c) displays a representative two-dimensional histogram of the polar angle 0
and the azimuthal angle ¢ gathered along a T = 50 K, P = 20 GPa molecular-dynamics
trajectory. Eight bright spots appear, revealing the eight symmetry orientations available
to an Hz molecule in the herringbone phase. As discussed in the main text, increasing
pressure forces the sticks, representing the Hz geometry, to align; in the fully ordered
regime, i.e. nematic, the eight spots collapse into two. Since @ is not well defined for 0 = 0
we see in practice two bands as shown in A2 (b).

P =3GPa(d).

Although eight maxima are visible, only two physically distinct orientations remain
once crystalline symmetries and the head-to-tail indistinguishability of the sticks are
taken into account:

(i) Polar symmetry. Because the colatitude of an unoriented stick is defined modulo
inversion, the two spots at 8; and 82 = 7 - 8; correspond to the same configuration.
(ii) Azimuthal symmetry. In the longitudinal direction one has $2 = ¢ + 7; the pair

(1, 62) therefore describes a single molecular orientation. The remaining spots at

3 = 1- fb; and #4 = 27 - 1 are likewise equivalent to each other.

Accordingly, at any pressure the eight histogram maxima partition into two families
of four spots, leaving only two genuinely different orientational states in the herringbone
phase. The quantum plastic case, with no orientational order, is shown in A2 (d).

27
B.2. Global order parameter

As explained in the Methods section, we define the order parameter to locate the transi-
tion between the quantum plastic and orientationally ordered phases. This parameter
is designed to capture the orientational coherence of the Hy» sublattice. It is constructed
as a structure factor, which vanishes when the Hz molecules are randomly oriented in
the quantum plastic phase, and interferes constructively when the molecules are in the
herringbone or nematic phase.

The global order parameter, Mtot, can be separated into two components: Mg, which
characterizes the order in 0, and Mg, which characterizes the order in :

Mtot = \/ Mg + Mj.

These components can be written individually as:

Mo =(hbo(t)I):, My = (hbo (t)]), +

Here, tpg(t) and q(t) are the rank-m order parameters with mg = 4 and my = 2 at
time t. They are defined as:

bo(t)= = x elmer" (t) ‘Bae = x gig 00 (1)
oe NG , 0) = de ,

The sum runs over the N Hp molecules in the system (= 1,..., N). The angles 0/0"
and $;°"" are the polar and azimuthal angles of the H molecules, corrected to give the
same phase in symmetrically equivalent configurations, as discussed in the previous
section. The goal is to have an order parameter that vanishes when the molecules are
disordered and equals 1 when the molecules are perfectly aligned, following the structure
factor concept.

For each molecule, the bond vector r,, is expressed in spherical coordinates (ry, 01, Pu)
in the crystal frame:

Ou = arccos(#) , oy = arctan 2(z, x.) €[-7, 7.

In order for the symmetric configurations mentioned above to yield the same phase in
the herringbone-like situation, one possible estimator for the 0 angle is sin 8. We flatten
the distribution of sin 0 via the cumulative distribution function (CDF) transform:

ore = 5 (1- cos @,,) € [0, x[ |.

28
This transformation ensures that, for an isotropic rotor, the phase exp(i0{°") is uni-
formly distributed on the circle, allowing the terms to cancel out statistically.

A similar approach is applied to ¢, since symmetric configurations have the same
phase when using | sin $|. Then, using the CDF to obtain a continuous uniform distribution,
we have:

Oyo" = Zaresin (| sin b,|) € [0, 27[ |

Baseline. To account for the finite size of our simulation (both in time and length), we
subtract a baseline: the same order parameter computed for a system of identical size
and the same number of time steps, but with completely random H) positions.

We show in Fig. A3 the evolution of the global order parameter as a function of temper-
ature for different pressure values. For example, at 3 GPa, we observe that Mtot vanishes
at 100 K.

Since Mtot is a global parameter, it cannot be evaluated within the framework of the
quantum embedded model, as it describes a single embedded Hp. As shown in the Methods
section, in the quantum embedded model, the appropriate parameter is the orientation
factor S. Thus, to predict the transition line between the disordered and ordered phases
in the quantum embedded model, we need to find a suitable criterion, i.e., the critical
value of S, that can indicate the transition from quantum plastic to ordered phases.

To do this, we compute the orientation factors S at the transition points predicted by
Mtot from molecular dynamics simulations at different pressures. This provides a criterion
to locate the phase transition in terms of S in the quantum embedded framework.

In practice, to evaluate S from molecular dynamics runs at the transition point (for
example, at 100 K and 3 GPa, as shown in Fig. A3), we need an estimate of Sz as defined
in Eq. 3 in the main paper. In the quantum embedded model, Sq is defined using the
alignment tensor involving the thermal density matrix, which is not obtained in the
classical molecular dynamics (MD) runs. Under the approximation of dominant charge
distribution effects via electrostatic interactions, we can replace thermal quantum effects
by classical thermal fluctuations, and estimate the critical value of S, for the quantum
model as a thermal average performed over the classical canonical ensemble in the
simulation cell at the classical transition point. Since the effective potential Vex: of the
quantum embedded model is obtained from the classical geometry at zero temperature,
the geometric contribution Sg to the orientation factor is the same for both quantum
embedded and classical MD frameworks. Thus, finding the threshold for S, is sufficient.
Moreover, we found that within the pressure and temperature resolution of our classical
MD simulations, Sq at the transition can be safely taken as pressure independent. By
averaging the obtained estimations of S, at the transition point over pressure (see Tab. Al),

Supplementary Information C. Free Rotor to Quantum Oscillator

Figure A5 is a visualisation of how the rotons of Hy — HzO and Dz - D20 change as the
pressure is increased to 40 GPa at 300 K. In panels A5(a) and (b), the So(0), So(1), So(2)
and S9(3) rotons are shown with incresing Raman shift frequency, from left to right,
respectively. The S(1) is the most intense. The intensity of all the rotons decrease as the
pressure is increased, whilst the peaks significantly broaden.

The evolution of the rotons of D2 — D20, shown in panels A5(c) and (d), is different
since the Raman spectrometer that was used for the experiments could not well resolve
the So(0) roton, and they were exceedingly weak in comparison to the Hz - HO case as
well, as indicated in the intensity scale of the different panels. Nonetheless, the So(1)

roton was clearly seen and traced in pressure. This peak broadens significantly more than
the equivalent HH So(1) roton.

Figure A6 shows the general broadening of the S9(0) and So(1) rotons in Hy - H2O and
Dz —- DO as pressure is increased to 40 GPa at 300 K. The rotons were modelled with three
components, referring to the So(x)o, So(x)1 and So(x)2 modes (x = [0,1]). These were
iteratively fitted, using the previous fitting to ensure that the peaks evolved naturally from
pressure to pressure, and that there were no sudden changes to the fitting regime. As can
be seen, our measured experimental data has been compared to the the experimental
data of pure Hy and D2 as reported by Pena-Alvarez et al. [48]. The rotons of HH shows a
good agreement with the rotons of pure Hp or Do.

Note that the Sp(1) roton progression in pressure is not shown for D2 - D20. Again, this
is due to the fact that the Raman spectrometer that was used did not have a good enough
resolution below 180 cm7! to determine the weak roton from the large background from
the elastic line.

Figure A7 compares the Centre of Mass’ of the Sg(1) rotons for Hy - H2O and D2 - D20
in pressure. The ’Centre of Mass’ of the peak was determined by fitting a single peak to
the data, instead of the three components of Sp(1)9, So(1)1 and So(1)2. The grey band
indicates the region where we observe the change in regime from a free roton to a quantum
harmonic oscillator potential, and the enclathrated Hy moves from a herringbone-like
arrangement and the excitation of the molecules adopt a librational character.

FIGURE A5. Raman shift for Hp - HzO and D2 - D2O as pressure is increased to 40 GPa at
300 K, visualised in a 3D-surface plot and a 2D-heat plot. Panels (a) and (b) show, with
increasing frequency, the four So(0), So(1), So(2) and So(3) rotons of Hy - H20 in pressure,
whilst panels (c) and (d) only show the weak So(1) roton of D2 - D320.

FIGURE A6. High-Pressure Raman measurements of the rotons of Hy — HO and D2 - D0.
The different roton components So(x)0, So(x)1 and So(x)2, are shown by the blue, orange
and magenta branches respectively. Open triangles represent measurements of pure Hy
or D2 as reported by Pena-Alvarez et al. [48], filled circles represent measurements of
Hp - H20 or Dz - D20 up to 40 GPa, and the thick grey line represents the position of the
’Centre of Mass’ of the entire So(x) peak. Panel (a) shows the So(0) roton for Hy — H 0,
panel (b) shows the S9(1) roton for Hy—H 0 and panel (c) show the So(1) roton for D)—D 0.
