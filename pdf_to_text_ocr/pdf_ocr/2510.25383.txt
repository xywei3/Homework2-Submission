ABSTRACT

Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have begun to reveal a sur-
prising morphological diversity in galaxies within the first billion years after the Big Bang, including
indications of structural maturity previously thought to arise much later. These findings raise fun-
damental questions about when and how well-known structural components of galaxy morphology,
such as bulges and disks, first emerged. However, directly identifying and resolving such structures at
z > 6 remains challenging due to limited spatial resolution and sensitivity. In this work, we present
a clear and robust morphological analysis of a sample of 190 galaxies at z > 6, demonstrating that
distinct bulge and disk components were already beginning to emerge during this early epoch. Using
multi-component light profile fitting, we model the radial brightness distributions of a subset (20) of
galaxies with an inner spheroidal (Sérsic) component and an underlying exponential disk. These sys-
tems exhibit high bulge-to-total (B/T) light ratios (~ 0.47) and central stellar mass surface densities
(~ 2.82x108 Mokpe~?) - values close to those of nearby quiescent galaxies. Combined with their
intense central star formation rate surface densities (~1.26x10! Moyr~!kpe~?), our results indicate a
rapid building of inner stellar mass and bulge assembly within these young systems. We propose that
these early bulge-disk galaxies represent progenitors of massive star-forming and quiescent systems
observed at lower redshifts. Their subsequent evolution may proceed through physical processes such
as disk growth, compaction, quenching, or bulge-disk co-evolution, driven by both internal dynamics

and external interactions.

1. INTRODUCTION

The origin of the rich morphological diversity ob-
served in present-day galaxies remains a central chal-
lenge in galaxy formation and evolution (Blanton &
Moustakas 2009; Conselice 2014; Somerville & Davé
2015; Naab & Ostriker 2017). Observations from the
Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Atacama Large Millime-
ter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and now the James
Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have pushed the redshift
frontier, revealing galaxies actively assembling their key
components. A significant fraction of massive galax-
ies up to z ~ 6 already exhibit regular, disk-like mor-
phologies, with nearly 20% showing prominent central
bulges (Huertas-Company et al. 2024). However, the
ACDM framework tends to over-predict both the abun-
dance and mass of bulges (Brooks & Christensen 2016),
a discrepancy often referred to as the “over-cooling prob-

lem’. Conversely, the discovery of bulgeless, pure-disk
galaxies at z ~ 1 (Sachdeva & Saha 2016) raises ques-
tions about the processes that suppress bulge formation
while preserving disk structure. Feedback mechanisms
are thought to play a key role: stellar feedback can mit-
igate over-cooling, while AGN feedback at high redshift
is a likely driver of bulgeless disks in simulations (Gover-
nato et al. 2007; Okamoto et al. 2008; Choi et al. 2014).
Still, the presence of evolved features - such as bulges
and spiral arms - within the first Gyr after the Big Bang
challenges the standard ACDM paradigm and highlights
the need to better understand the formation and evolu-
tion of these structures (e.g., De Lucia et al. 2011).
Stellar
the centers of both early- and late-type galaxies. More
than half of present-day spiral galaxies host a central
bulge (Fisher & Drory 2008; Gadotti 2009; Kormendy
2016). Although they resemble scaled-down elliptical
systems, bulges differ significantly from ellipticals when

ulges are spheroidal components located at

kinematic properties are considered (e.g., Dressler &
2 BorRGOHAIN & SAHA

Sandage 1983; Davies & Illingworth 1983; Kormendy &
Kennicutt 2004; Fisher & Drory 2008; Gadotti 2009).
Photometrically identified bulges are broadly classified
into two types - classical and pseudo—based on their
evolutionary characteristics (Drory & Fisher 2007; Kor-
mendy & Kennicutt 2004). Classical bulges, more com-
monly found in early-type galaxies, share several prop-
erties with elliptical galaxies: redder colors, older stellar
populations, dynamically hot and dispersion-supported
kinematics, and high Sérsic indices (n > 2, typically
~4) (Kormendy & Illingworth 1982; Zoccali et al. 2006;
Lecureur et al. 2007; Kormendy & Kennicutt 2004;
Fisher & Drory 2008; Gadotti 2009). They also follow
the same scaling relations and lie on the fundamental
plane of ellipticals (Falcén-Barroso et al. 2002; Driver
et al. 2007; MacArthur et al. 2008; Fisher & Drory 201
In contrast, pseudo bulges are more prevalent in late-
type galaxies (Thomas & Davies 2006), and exhibit disk-
like properties such as bluer colors (indicating ongoing
star formation and younger stellar populations), rota-
tional support, and lower central light concentrations
(n < 2) (Drory & Fisher 2007; Fisher & Drory 2008;
Gadotti 2009; Fisher & Drory 2011).

The formation of stellar bulges is a key process in
galaxy evolution, closely linked to the quenching of star
formation in galactic disks (e.g., Sachdeva et al. 2019;
Lang et al. 2014). Observationally, about ~60% of mas-
sive galaxies (IM, > 10° Mo) in the Local Volume host
a stellar bulge, while the remainder are either bulge-
less or in the process of forming one (Fisher & Drory
2011). Although the fraction of bulge-hosting galax-
ies declines with increasing redshift, evolved bulges and
signs of quenching have been detected as early as z ~ 6
(e.g., Whitaker et al. 2012; Barro et al. 2017; Sachdeva
et al. 2019; Lelli et al. 2021; Huertas-Company et al.
2024; Jain & Wadadekar 2024; Xiao et al. 2025), suggest-
ing that bulge formation and the associated suppression
of star formation can occur rapidly, and more efficiently
than predicted by standard models for young galaxies.

Current theories identify two broad formation chan-
nels: Classical bulges are thought to have formed
through rapid, violent processes such as monolithic col-
lapse (Larson 1974) or major mergers within a Gyr
(Hernquist & Barnes 1991; Aguerri et al. 2001; Mihos
2004; Springel et al. 2005), often accompanied by in-
tense starbursts or AGN activity (Mihos 2004; Okamoto
2013). These systems can later rebuild their disks via
gas accretion (Brook et al. 2004). In contrast, pseudo
bulges form gradually over longer timescales (2 Gyr)
through secular processes such as bar-driven gas inflows,
intermittent central star formation, and internal disk in-
stabilities (Combes et al. 1990; Courteau et al. 1996; Ko-

rmendy & Kennicutt 2004; Saha & Cortesi 2018). Addi-
tional mechanisms like radial migration, minor mergers,
or dynamical rearrangement of the disk can also con-
tribute to the bulge growth (Springel & Hernquist 2005;
Rogkar et al. 2012; Johnston et al. 2012; Guedes et al.
2013; Morelli et al. 2016). Faster bulge formation is
also possible via the coalescence of massive star-forming
clumps—driven by dynamical friction or through strong,
centrally concentrated gas inflows, both acting over a
ew hundred Myr (Noguchi 1999; Bournaud et al. 2007;
Elmegreen et al. 2008; Mandelker et al. 2017; Saha &
Cortesi 2018). These rapidly evolving systems may ap-
pear as compact, star-forming “blue nuggets,” which
have been observed across cosmic time (Dimauro et al.
2022; Lapiner et al. 2023).

It is challenging to explain the assembly of massive
bulges within a short span of time (less than a few hun-
dred Myr) after the Big Bang. A complete census of
bulges at the earliest epochs will help constrain the in-
erplay of mechanisms that can act within a Gyr such
as rapid gas inflows, violent disk instabilities and mas-
sive clump migration (Dekel et al. 2009; Bournaud et al.
2014; Conselice 2014; Saha & Cortesi 2018). This has
ong been limited by the small sizes and low surface
brightness of bulges at these redshifts and insufficient
spatial resolution. With the unprecedented resolving
power of JWST, we can now probe such structures in
detail in the primordial galaxies. Also, JWST’s abil-
ity to probe rest-frame optical and bluer wavelengths
in high redshift galaxies enables us to trace the ongoing
stellar mass assembly. In this study, we aim to develop a
comprehensive picture of when and how quickly galactic
bulges emerge and evolve.

Throughout this paper, we use a flat A CDM cosmol-
ogy with Hubble constant, Hp = 70 km s~! Mpe~! , Qn,
= 0.3 and Qa = 0.7. We quote all magnitudes in the
AB magnitude system (Oke 1974).

2. DATA AND SAMPLE SELECTION

In this work, we focus on galaxies that assembled
at z > 6. We select sources from the GOODS-North
and South fields with spectroscopically confirmed red-
shift measurements (Zspec) from the publicly available
JWST surveys and associated catalogs - JADES (Eisen-
stein et al. 2023a,b; Rieke et al. 2023; Hainline et al.
2024; Bunker et al. 2024; D’Eugenio et al. 2025) and
FRESCO (Oesch et al. 2023; Meyer et al. 2024; Covelo-
Paz et al. 2025). Our initial sample comprises of 335
objects, which we cross-match with the (point-spread
function) PSF-matched catalog of Merlin et al. (2024)
and acquire multiband PSF-matched photometry. As
emphasized in previous studies, accurate broadband col-

ors are crucial for estimating unbiased stellar masses and
star-formation rates (SFRs) (e.g., Sawicki 2012; Merlin
et al. 2024). This yields a downsized sample of 301 ob-
jects with consistent, multiband photometric fluxes. We
then construct and model the spectral energy distribu-
tions (SEDs) as described in the following section.

3. SPECTRAL ENERGY DISTRIBUTION
MODELING

We use the Python-based SED modeling code
CIGALE (Boquien et al. 2019; Burgarella et al. 2025)
to derive the stellar masses of our galaxy sample. In
that, we use the PSF-matched photometric fluxes from
Merlin et al. (2024), which provide unbiased colors over
multiband observations. The fluxes are measured over
16 broadband filters from the HST-F435W to F160W
and JWST-FO90W to F444W. We correct all the fluxes
for foreground Galactic extinction using dust maps from
the NED database (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011). For the
SED modeling, we use a Chabrier (Chabrier 2003) ini-
tial mass function (IMF) with BC03 (Bruzual & Charlot
2003) stellar population models and assume a delayed
star-formation history with a recent burst of star for-
mation. To model the attenuation, we use a modified
Calzetti extinction law (Calzetti et al. 2000) and dust
models from (Draine & Li 2007; Draine et al. 2014). We
present a detailed information on the CIGALE configu-
ration file in Table 1.

4. 2D MODELLING

In this work, we are interested to study the morphol-
ogy of the galaxies as traced by their younger stellar
population - to track the ongoing assembly. In that,
we utilize those broadband JWST images that probe
the rest-frame U (~3200-4000A) and B (~4000-5000 A)

emission. This allows us to maximize the redshift cov-

erage in the optical regime. In cases where multiple fil-
ers probe these ranges, we use the one that with which
here is a higher overlap. We prepare the galaxy sample
‘or modeling their 2D light distributions using GALFIT
(Peng et al. 2002, 2010) by obtaining cutouts of 2.5x2.5
arcsec. We mask all neighboring objects prior to mod-
eling, by using the segmentation image obtained from
he JADES archive. We note that full coverage of all
sources across all the JWST filters is not available and
hus not every galaxy in the sample has imaging in the
desired filters. For example, an object may be present
in the FRESCO or JADES catalog, but no imaging in
et’s say, the F356W filter. Additionally, we do a visual
inspection and discard further objects from the sample
because they are too faint or irregular to model. The fi-
nal sample consists of 222 galaxies for which we perform

he morphological analysis.

4.1. Single component fit

We begin with a single Sersic function to model the
galaxy sample. Here, the intensity at a distance R is
given by

I(R) = fest (z)" -1|} (1)

where, I, is the intensity at the half-light or effective
radius R,, n is the Sersic index and b,, is such that
T(2n) = 2y(2n, b,). During the modeling, we take the
PSF of the appropriate JWST filter into account, so
that we obtain the intrinsic structural parameters. We
apply conservative bounds on the parameter ranges for
stability and to avoid unphysical results as follows: 0.2
<n<5.0 and 1.5 < R, < 10 pixels. The lower limit for
R, is chosen so that it is not smaller than the PSF of the
image (~ 3 pixel FWHM). An upper limit on Re =10
pixels (0.3 arcsec) is used which is equivalent to ~1.7
kpe at z ~6; and 1 kpc at z ~ 18.

4.2. Double-component fit

We perform a visual assessment of the residual-maps
from the single component models along with the 1D
residual profiles. Based on this, we discard a few of the

galaxies with clear unrealistic fits, leaving a final sam-
ple of 190 galaxies. Among these, we select 20 candidate
galaxies for which a single Sersic model is insufficient to
model the observed outer light distribution. Addition-
ally, we check if the surface brightness profiles (SBPs)
of these candidates extend beyond the radius enclosing
~80% of the PSF flux. For these galaxies, we explore the
possibility that the extension of the outer light distribu-
tion is due to the presence of an underlying stellar disk.
We note that the decision to include another component

is non-trivial. However, based on our assessment of the
residual profiles and the extent of the SBPs as compared
to the PSF, we rerun GALFIT on these objects by in-
cluding an additional exponential disk component. For
an exponential disk, equation 1 is modified accordingly
for a value of n=1. Two of the candidates, despite being
smaller than the 80% PSF light radius could also be well
fitted with a two-component model. We note that it is
quite challenging to distinguish multiple components at
such high redshifts due to the PSF as highlighted in pre-
vious studies (see Meert et al. 2015; Lange et al. 2016).

In our two-component modeling, we use the best-fit
parameters from the single-Sersic fits as initial guesses
and use the same parameter bounds except for Re. Here,
we explore the possibility of an outer stellar disk and not

in place during our 2-component analy which is in

tive example of two-component morphological decom-
position is shown in Figure 1. The fals

of a few best cases of two-component galaxies are shown
in Figure 2

We assess the limitations and accuracy of our GAL-
FIT modelling for these high-z systems by creating mock

galaxies using a combination Sersic and exponential disk
components. We find that there is a higher accuracy in
the recovery of true parameters when a galaxy extends
beyond the size enclosing 80% of the PSF light. We pro-
vide further details of this test in the Appendix of the
paper. To assess the requirement for a two-component
model for our candidate galaxies, we make use of the
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC, Schwarz 1978). It
is a statistical criterion which helps to decide if a com-
plex model should be preferred over a simple one (e.g.,

embly. This is important because of

Paulino-Afonso et al. 2019). It is given by:
BIC =x? +kxIn(N) (2)

where \? is the goodness of fit value from GALFIT,
k is the number of free parameters of the model and N
is the number of datapoints used during the modeling
(number of pixels). We measure this quantity for the
single-Sersic (BICs) and Sersic+exponential (BICsz)
model and compute the difference to obtain an estimate

ABIC as follows:
ABIC = BICsz — BICs (3)

To ensure that a complex model is better than a simple
model, ABIC < -10 is used (e.g.,
2019).

5. RESULTS

We compare the structural properties of the galaxies
at Cosmic Dawn, obtained from single Sersic modeling,
to their local counterparts in the CANDELS fields (Di-
mauro et al. 2018) as shown in Figure 3. A clear trend
with stellar mass is apparent, wherein the z > 6 galaxies
are compact (median R, = 0.52 kpc) and exhibit lower
Sersic indices (median n = 0.97) at a given stellar mass
(median M,/Mo = 8.45). This provides an indication
that the galaxies are steadily growing in mass via star-
formation. The low-z (0 < z < 3) counterparts have

7.60 kpe ( = 5.64 kpc), n = 1.25 ( = 3.14) and M,/Mo
= 9.68 ( = 10.43) for star-forming (quiescent) galaxies.

We now bring our attention to those galaxies that host:
a bulge and an underlying disk component. Previous
studies of bulge properties and their evolution in the low-
z Universe (e.g., Sachdeva et al. 2017, 2019) highlight
z ~ 2 as an important period of bulge assembly within
disks, or of disk growth around pre-existing spheroids
(Sachdeva et al. 2019). Previous studies observe that
the fraction of galaxies that host a stellar bulge and a
disk increases from 46% at 2 < z < 4 to 70% at 1.5
< z < 2 (Sachdeva et al. 2019). As we extend this
census to z > 6, our results show that the mechanisms
driving such morphological transformation may already
be in place at very early times. We find that ~10%
of the galaxies in our sample host a bulge and a disk.
We present the distributions of their stellar mass den-
sity (Ure), galaxy star-formation timescale (Ts) and
star-formation rate surface density Usrr in Figure 4.
These galaxies occupy the extreme ends of these dis-
tributions when compared to their low-z counterparts.
These z > 6 galaxies exhibit high Up. (median Up. =
2.82x 10° Mokpe~?) and intense star formation as re-
flected in their low tsp (median tgp = 0.04 Gyr) and
high Ssrr (median Ssrr = 1.2610! Moyr~tkpe~?).
These findings point to a rapid inner stellar mass as-
sembly, which is expected in the inside-out scenario of
galaxy growth. Moreover, multiple studies have shown
that increasing central stellar mass density can act as a
driver of quenching (e.g., Fang et al. 2013; Lang et al.
2014). The high central densities that we measure in our
z > 6 two-component galaxies are similar to some of the

densest stellar systems known in the nearby Universe
(Hopkins et al. 2010).

5.1. Bulge size vs galaxy stellar mass

We investigate whether the extreme star-formation, as
indicated by the above results, contributes significantly
o bulge growth at Cosmic Dawn. For that, we examine
he bulge size (Re,bulge) in relation to the total galaxy
stellar mass as shown in Figure 5. It shows that the
high-z bulges are more compact for a given galaxy stel-
ar mass and their sizes increase with increasing stellar
mass. However, Bruce et al. (2014) find that, at later
epochs (1< z <3), stellar bulges have similar sizes in
both star-forming and quiescent galaxies. This is also
evident in the CANDELS galaxies as shown in the fig-
ure. This finding at z > 6, in which massive galaxies
host larger bulges, points towards the possibility that
bulge growth occurs, primarily due to star-formation.
These bulges are then likely to evolve into their low-z
counterparts via subsequent dynamical processes. Ad-
ditionally, as highlighted in section 1, we also expect dy-
namical processes acting over short timescales to play a
significant role in early bulge assembly.

5.2. Evolution of Bulge size and bulge-to-total light
(B/T)

We present the bulge sizes and bulge-to-total light ra-
tios (B/T) for the two-component galaxies in our sample
in Figure 6, and compare them with those of low-z sys-
tems. We use the PSF-corrected GALFIT model magni-
tudes of the Sersic and exponential disk components to
estimate the B/T values for our sample. We crossmatch
the morphological catalog of Dimauro et al. (2018) with
3DHST catalog (Brammer et al. 2012; Momcheva et al.

exist at such epochs. The high B/T values observed for
our z > 6 galaxies, comparable to those of low-z qui-
escent galaxies (median B/T = 0.49), and shorter Ts 7
(Figure 4) provide further evidence that a rapid build-up
of their bulges is happening in the early Universe. Their
elevated stellar mass densities also imply that the drivers
of quenching were already in place within the first Gyr.
Previous observations have identified quenched galaxies
at z > 4 with compact and dense bulges that lead to
their quenching in less than a Gyr (Barro et al. 2013;
Dekel & Burkert 2014). The increasing number of such
quenched galaxies at high-z, as revealed by newer ob-
servations (Tanaka et al. 2019; Nanayakkara et al. 2025;
Antwi-Danso et al. 2025) also suggest an early onset of
quenching, which is crucial to explain the emergence of
quiescent galaxies at these epochs.

Figure 6 reveals two apparent sequences in the B/T
values as a function of z, corresponding to star-forming
and quiescent galaxies. It shows that quiescent galax-
ies have higher B/T ratios (median B/T = 0.49) than
star-forming galaxies (median B/T = 0.24). Although

we don’t find an evolution of
escent galaxies (lo scatter = 0

Figure 6 shows that galaxies at z > 6 exhibit high

with the formation of bulges within the first Gyr. Such

Burkert 2014; Zolotov et al. 2015). This is likely to be
accompanied by inward migration of massive clumps,
rapid gas inflows or major mergers within timescales <1
Gyr (Noguchi 1999; Dekel et al. 2009; Hopkins et al.
2009; Ceverino et al. 2010; Tacchella et al. 2016). Sub-
sequently, the halo gas or accreting gas can settle into
stable rotating disks. As the stellar bulge quenches
and the disk continues to form stars, the B/T ratio de-
creases along with the decrease in the relative bulge-
Alternatively, intense star
AGN activity in young bulges can exhaust, expel, or
ionize the pristine halo gas. This thereby suppresses
subsequent disk growth or quenches the system com-
pletely, resulting in high B/T ratios observed in quies-
cent galaxies or potentially evolve into elliptical galax-
ies. This dual evolutionary pathway is consistent with
theoretical expectations (Dekel & Burkert 2014; Zolo-
tov et al. 2015; Tacchella et al. 2016), and is supported
by studies of “blue nuggets” and their quenched descen-
dants at z 2 2 (Barro et al. 2013; van Dokkum et al.
2015). It is interesting to note that the Re puige/Redisk
ratio of quiescent galaxies, based on the HST observa-
tions of CANDELS galaxies, does not evolve over a wide
range of z. The B/T ratio also appears to be constant
with the exception of an outlier value at z ~2.5. This
indicates a possible co-evolution of the bulge and disk
components in these systems, which will be explored in
a future work. We do not rule out this possibility for
star-forming galaxies also, due to the fact that only a
mild evolution is observed in their Re puige/Re,disk Ta-

5.3. Galazy main sequence at z > 6

We examine the star-forming main sequence (MS) for
our galaxy sample at z > 6 and compare it with the re-
lation in the local Universe (Salim et al. 2016, 2018), as
shown in Figure 7. Here, we select only the star-forming
galaxies with specific star-formation rate (sSFR) > -11
yr~! (Salim et al. 2018). As predicted by simulations,
the MS relation is already in place during Cosmic Dawn,
driven by highly efficient and self-regulated star forma-
tion. Such high efficiency is expected to result from high
gas fractions, short depletion timescales, merger-driven
starbursts and/or clumpy gas accretion (Ceverino et al.
2018; D’Silva et al. 2023). However, some models also
suggest that the assembly of the first massive galax-
ies may deviate from this expected scenario (e.g., Qin
et al. 2023). We find that the majority of galaxies in
our sample agree well with the MS predictions at high-z
(D’Silva et al. 2023), exhibiting high sSFRs as compared
to present-day sys

We also identify the morphologies of our sample in
Figure 7. A major fraction of the galaxies are disk-like
(n <1.5), as probed in the rest frame optical B-band
emission. This finding is consistent with previous ob-
servations at high-z, that report a high fraction of disk-
like galaxies (e.g., Ferreira et al. 2023; Kartaltepe et al.
2023). A smaller fraction of galaxies (log M/Mo S9.5)
have higher sersic indices (n >1.5), which we categorize
as spheroid-like. As these galaxies evolve, the disk-like

galaxies may build their stellar bulges or conversely, the 6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
spheroid like galaxies may build their outer disks at later
times (e.g., Sachdeva & Saha 2018). However, at this
stage there is no clear dichotomy in morphology with
stellar mass, and both the disk and spheroid-like pop-
ulation are well mixed. This is expected of galaxies at
these epochs as they are still in the process of assembly.
We note that all the galaxies in the sample that contain
a bulge and an exponential disk have stellar mass log

In this work, we have studied a sample of spectro-
scopically confirmed galaxies that existed when the Uni-
verse was less than a Gyr old. We perform broadband
SED modelling of the galaxies to gain insight into their
star formation properties. Subsequently, we performed
a morphological analysis of the sample using GALFIT
and found a subset that hosts a growing stellar bulge.
The key findings of our work are as follows:

information is based on rest-frame B-band emission for our sample and SDSS-g band for local galaxies. Different main-sequence
relations obtained from observations and predicted from simulations is shown by different curves. Black dashed curve represents
the observed main sequence relation for high-z galaxies from Thorne et al. (2021). The green dotted curve represents the
predicted relation for high-z galaxies from the FLARES-JWST simulations (D’Silva et al. 2023). The solid gray curve represents

the observed relation in the local Universe(Renzini & Peng 2015).

galaxies have rapidly grown their cores and reach
stellar mass densities as high as ~ 10'° Mokpe7?.
With high B/T ratios (~0.47), it is evident that
heir stellar disks are yet to form and they will
evolve into their low-z counterparts.

e The onset of quenching due to bulge formation and
high stellar densities is indicated by low SFRs in a
subset of galaxies (at z > 6), which lie below the
redicted MS relation for galaxies at these epochs.

The presence of dense stellar bulges at these early
times can provide key insights into the existence of quies-
cent galaxies at high redshift. These compact structures
may also create favorable conditions for the early growth
of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) (e.g., Dubois et al.
2012). We do not investigate the environment of these

galaxies, but dense environments could also play a role
in the accelerated assembly of bulges through frequent
interactions and mergers, as suggested by simulations
(Lapiner et al. 2023). The rapid growth of bulges that
we observe at z > 6 implies that the dominant processes
must be highly dissipative and efficient, consistent with
wet mergers and compaction-driven channels. As these
systems evolve, they may separate into star-forming or
quiescent populations of galaxies depending on whether
their disks are able to stabilize and continue to grow
via sustained gas accretion, or whether feedback mech-
anisms quench further growth. In either scenario, our
findings of bulge and disk components in galaxies at
z > 6 provide crucial evidence for rapid central mass
assembly and the onset of inside-out quenching during
Cosmic Dawn.

B. RESULTS FROM GALFIT RUNS ON MOCK OBJECTS

In the challenging regime of morphological decomposition at high redshift, it is essential to understand the limita-
tions and accuracy of our modeling. Given the compact nature of the objects, the modeling is highly susceptible to
parameter degeneracies and assumptions. To validate and check the accuracy of our double-component decomposition,
we generated mock galaxies with a Sersic + exponential disk component for n = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.5. The mean half-
light radius values, R, for each case are 2 (o=0.5), 5 (o=1.0), 8 (*=1.0) and 15 (7=1.0) pixels. The mean scale-length
values of the exponential disk, R, for each case are 4 (o=0.5), 7 (7=1.0), 10 (o=1.0) and 20 (o=1.0) pixels. The value
of I. = 0.05 and Jp = 0.04 was fixed for all the mock objects. There are 500 objects each for every value of n. We fi
the mocks using GALFIT in the same manner as explained above in section 3.2.2.

The exercise shows that:

e For mean R, = 2 pixels, the values of n except for R., Rs, and B/T are highly unreliable. Across all values of
n, the sizes and magnitudes are recovered well. We observe that the accuracy increases with larger sizes of the
components. Please note that we did not inspect the variation with changing magnitudes.

e We look into the 1D radial surface brightness profiles of the mocks and find that if the outer extent (beyonc
which Ap <0.3 mag arcsec?) is larger than the size that encloses 80% of the PSF flux, the model value of n is
closer to its true value.

e Thus, the level of noise (and hence the observed size) plays a crucial role in the accuracy of the modelle
parameters. As stated above, to make sure that our derived parameters are closest to the true structural
parameters of the galaxy, we select only those objects for two-component decomposition whose outer extent is
larger than the size that encloses 80% of the PSF flux. We present the results of our exercise in Appendix of the

paper.

The results of the exercise, after selecting mocks with sizes larger than 80% PSF-flux size, are presented in a tabular
form as follows:

Table 3. Table showing the true parameters (mean value) to generate the mocks and the recovered parameters (mean value)

after GALFIT modeling, in appropriate columns. The Mock+;,ac represents the number of mocks that have sizes larger than the
80% PSF-flux size. The errors represent the l-o scatter of the distributions.
