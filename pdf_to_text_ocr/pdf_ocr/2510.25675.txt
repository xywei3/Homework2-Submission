Abstract

Due to the wide range of technical applications of actinide elements, a
thorough understanding of their electronic structure could complement
technological improvements in many different areas. Quantum comput-
ing could greatly aid in this understanding, as it can potentially provide
exponential speedups over classical approaches, thereby offering insights
into the complex electronic structure of actinide compounds. As a first
foray into quantum computational chemistry of actinides, this paper
compares the method of quantum computed moments (QCM) as a noisy
intermediate-scale quantum algorithm with a single-ancilla version of

1 Introduction

Actinides play a vital role in a wide range of applications, including energy
generation, medical diagnostics and imaging technologies, nuclear safety, and
catalysis [1, 2]. Despite their significance, experimental studies of actinide
compounds are often limited by their toxicity and radioactivity. Moreover,
actinide-containing materials are typically characterised by strong electron cor-
relation due to the near-degeneracy of the 5f, 6d, and 7s orbitals and significant
relativistic effects due to spin-orbit coupling. These features often render con-
ventional computational methods, such as density functional approximations
and coupled cluster theory, unreliable for accurately describing their elec-
tronic structure. Multireference approaches and complete active space (CAS)
methods provide more accurate descriptions in such cases [3]. However, their
applicability is limited to moderately small systems due to their exponentially
scaling computational costs [4].
n this context, quantum computing has the potential to usher in a new era
in modelling the electronic structure of actinides [5]. Recent advances in quan-
tum computing algorithms for fault-tolerant devices offer near-linear scaling
in the computational cost of CAS methods [6, 7]. This enables large-scale CAS
descriptions providing near-exact solutions for complex and strongly correlated
chemical systems.

This study explores the application of quantum computational techniques
to the investigation of the electronic structure and reactivity of actinide sys-
tems. A particular focus of this foray into quantum computational actinide
chemistry lies thereby on the chemical behavior of prototypical species like
plutonium oxides and plutonium hydrides and their role in hydride-catalysed
oxidation and corrosion reactions. A detailed understanding of such processes
is critical for developing efficient and safe technologies as, for example, hydride-
catalysed oxidation of actinides like plutonium can lead to thermal excursions,
a variety of other hazards, and ultimately a higher risk of containment failure
during storage. [2, 8, 9]

The quantum algorithms used in this work can be grouped into two main
categories. The first category is Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) [10] that
offers an efficient way, given a state with sufficient overlap with the true
wave function, to determine the eigenvalues of a unitary by reconstructing the
unknown phase to a high precision. In quantum chemistry, QPE enables accu-
rate computation of ground- and excited-state energies and, notably, provides

Quantum simulation of actinide chemistry with quantum computers 3

a polynomial-time solution to the full configuration interaction (FCI) prob-
lem [11]. However, the practical implementation of standard QPE is hindered
by its substantial circuit depth and the need for a large number of ancilla
qubits; challenges that are exacerbated further by the limitations of current
and near-term utility-scale quantum hardware. To address these limitations, we
employ a single-ancilla-qubit variant of QPE known as the Quantum Complex
Exponential Least Squares (QCELS) technique [12], combined with a circuit
recompilation strategy, which ensures that the circuit depth remains constant
with respect to the powers of the unitary operator used in phase estimation.

[he other category of algorithms, quantum subspace expansion, is based
on projecting the Schrédinger equation to a subspace spanned by a finite
number of basis states, resulting in a low-dimensional eigenvalue problem
that can be diagonalized classically [13]. In particular, a Lanczos tridiagonal-
ized form of the Hamiltonian can be derived from the expectation values o:
Hamiltonian moments [14]. Measuring these moment expectations quantum

computationally and evaluating the corresponding lowest eigenvalue of the
Lanczos subspace, are the key concepts of the method of Quantum Computec
Moments (QCM) [15]. In this work, we focus on QCM4, the expansion of the
ground state energy in terms of Hamiltonian moments truncated to fourth
order [16]. This approximation describes electron correlation interactions no
accessible by mean-field theories like Hartree-Fock [17].

The algorithms discussed above were applied to various systems containing
plutonium (Pu) using Quantinuum’s H1 and H2 trapped ion quantum hard-
ware and emulators. Where feasible, Complete Active Space Configuration
Interaction (CASCI) and CASSCF (Complete Active Space Self Consistent
Field) calculations were performed to benchmark the accuracy of the quantum
results.

This paper is structured as follows. We begin by describing the two quan-
tum algorithms employed in this work: statistical QPE [18] and QCM4. Next,
we outline the rationale behind our choice of model systems and, then, we
present the results of our simulations, followed by a discussion of the key chal-
lenges encountered during the project. Finally, we conclude with a summary
and offer perspectives for future research.

2 Methods

In this section, we describe the two quantum algorithms employed in this work,
along with key details of the quantum hardware used for their implementation.

2.1 QPE and Hamiltonian Simulation

The canonical QPE algorithm for chemical electronic structure problems uti-
lizes the time evolution operator U(r) = e~*#7 of the Hamiltonian H, where
T is time. If 7 is chosen such that the eigen-spectrum of Hr (phase angles) lies
within [0, 277) the eigenvalues of the unitary and the eigenvalues of H (energies)
have a one-to-one correspondence. The canonical QPE estimates the phase by

4 Quantum simulation of actinide chemistry with quantum computers

applying controlled powers of the unitary time evolution operator, where the
controls are on an auxiliary qubit register. The phase is then read out from this
auxiliary register using an inverse Quantum Fourier Transformation (QFT).
While several methods have been proposed to construct the controlled-unitary
operator, such as Quantum Signal Processing [19], the Trotter-Suzuki decom-
position is the most widely used [20, 21]. Trotterization, as it is commonly
called, splits the exponential of a sum of non-commuting terms into a product
of exponential factors. As particular example, first-order Trotterization can be

r
expressed as e~'7 = ( TT, eit/" | with H = ); Hj, 7 number of dis-

crete Trotter steps. While exact in the infinitesimal case, r + oo, any finite
number of steps introduces so-called Trotter error, which accumulates with
time 7 and depends on the number of terms H; and their magnitude. While
larger values of r reduce Trotter errors, they quickly lead to quantum circuits
of prohibitively large depths for current and near-term quantum computers.
This is exacerbated even more in the Trotterization of the controlled powers
of unitaries needed to obtain the quantum phase with higher precision.

Due to these considerations, we focus on statistical phase estimation based
on Hamiltonian simulation. This variant of QPE uses only a single ancilla
qubit, reducing the canonical QPE circuit to a Hadamard-test circuit [Fig. 1
(al)|. Canonical QPE stores a superposition of many time-evolved states
with evolution times of multiples of 7, and recovers the phase with a QFT,
optimally with a single measurement of the ancilla register. In contrast, the
statistical QPE we consider replaces the entire QFT stage with classical sta-
tistical analysis and requires multiple measurements. At each time step t
we independently prepare the time-evolved state and measure the complex
overlap (w|~(t)) between the initial state |) and its evolved counterpart
|W(t)) = e~“# |). Because only one ancilla is required, the circuit contains
a single controlled time-evolution operator, dramatically decreasing the depth
relative to canonical QPE.

The overall accuracy of this approach relies heavily on the effectiveness of
the classical statistical analysis which is an active area of research [12, 22]. In
our experiments the phase is retrieved by means of the QCELS [12] method,
which performs a non-linear least-squares fit to the overlaps recorded at
multiple times (see Sec. $1 in the Supplementary Information (SI) for details).

2.1.1 Variational compilation

While statistical QPE requires only a single application of the controlled
time-evolution unitary, even a single Trotter step becomes very deep for large
systems. Increasing circuit depth not only extends the simulation time but also
leads to noise accumulation. Tab. 1 shows the typical two-qubit depth of the
single step trotterized time evolution operator for the molecules we investigate.
Because a single Trotter step is usually insufficient for chemical accuracy, the

actual depth of a controlled time-evolution circuit can be orders of magnitude
larger than the numbers in Tab. 1. A practical way to bypass this prohibitive
Quantum simulation of actinide chemistry with quantum computers 5

depth is variational compilation [18, 23-27]. Variational compilation enables us
to prepare shallow measurement circuits and thus demonstrate the potential
performance of statistical phase estimation. The main goal of this prototyping
effort is to evaluate how well such algorithmic combinations work for simple
Pu models.

The workings of the variational compilation method are illustrated in
Fig. 1, panels (a2) and (a3), and additional details are provided in the SI,
Sec. $2. Panel (a2) shows that the ansatz replaces the deep controlled-time-
evolution part of (al), as well as the initial state preparation. Tab. 1 lists the
number of two-qubit gates used in the ansatz for each active space, and the
mean fidelities quantify how successful the compilations are. Here, fidelity is
defined as | (|y)(t)) |?, and its mean is obtained by averaging over t. The vari-
ational compilation is limited both by the expressibility of the ansatz and by
the global optimization procedure.

In general, the computational complexity of variational compilation grows

with the dimensionality of the unitary being compiled, the resulting num-
ber of parameters, and the difficulty of the associated minimization problem.
Consequently, the compilation technique used here becomes impractical for

large active spaces. The insights gained from these tests should motivate the
development of scalable recompilation techniques for future QPE experiments.

of commuting Pauli strings, when commuting sets are used) contributing to Hamiltonian
moments up to n = 4.

2.2 Subspace methods: Quantum Computed Moments

QCM4, the fourth order expansion of the quantum computed moments
method [16, 17], is used as an example of quantum algorithms suitable for near
term intermediate scale quantum computers.

Like variational quantum algorithms, QCM4 relies on the same type of
measurements of expectation values of Pauli strings. However, QCM4 is a
quantum subspace expansion algorithm. As such it does not rely on variational
optimization of a parameterized ansatz to obtain an accurate approximation
to the ground state energy, which can be plagued by barren plateau effects.
Compared to QPE, QCM4 does not require the application of a time evolution
operator and therefore results in significantly shallower quantum circuits.

However, the drawback of QCM4 is its generally large number of mea-
surement samples (also called “shots”) required to obtain accurate results,
especially for large molecules and states. This is due to the need to measure
the expectation values of different moments of the Hamiltonian operator, i.e.
(H) as well as (H?), (H?) and (H+), Investigating the differences between
QCM4 and QPE and their effect on the quantum computed energies for Pu
molecules of different sizes is the main aspect of the algorithmic comparisons
in this paper.

In the QCM4 method, expectation values of powers of the Hamiltonian
operator (H”) are measured with respect to a simple initial guess for the
molecular wavefunction, which we refer to as the QCM4 input state |Yqcma).
An approximation to the ground state energy is then obtained [17] in terms of
these expectation values, using Eq. 1

For Pu2Q3 the input state |Vaoma) is a 2-electron, 2-determinant wavefunc-
tion consisting of the Hartree-Fock determinant plus its closed shell double
excitation, which can be prepared using 3 2-qubit gates [28]. The procedure
for running QCM4 is represented in Fig. 1, panel (b); one such circuit can
be measured for each Pauli string contributing to A” for n = 1,2,3,4. By
grouping Pauli strings into commuting sets, the number of circuits to mea-
sure for moment n is significantly less than the number of Pauli strings L,.
For more technical details on the use of commuting sets to measure Hamil-
tonian moments in relation to QCM4, we refer the reader to works on this
method [15, 17].
To further reduce the quantum resource requirements, a simple truncation
procedure is applied to remove Pauli strings with coefficients below a threshold

value in each H”. This was carried out in the H1-1 experiment for PuzO3 (see
Sec. 3.2.2).

Due to the shallow input state used for QCM4, the main source of error is
likely due to the noise from measuring individual contributions of Pauli strings
Press The latter contribute to the Hamiltonian moments as

Ln

i

To investigate this, and to possibly determine the Pauli strings whose measure-
ment contributes the most to noise, the ideal values of each (Pin) with respect
to |Waoma) are determined classically, to compare the noisy measured result
to its ideal value. We observe that for PuH, and PuHg3 only those Pauli strings
consisting of Z rotations (with no X or Y) were non-zero, likely due to the
high spin multiplicity combined with the state-average CASSCF procedure to
obtain the appropriate spin orbitals within the small active space (discussed
in Sec. 3.3). For PugOs, in addition to the Z strings the following 4 are also
non-zero: (YO X1 X2 Y3), (X1X2Y3Y4), (Y1Y2 X3 X4), and (X1Y2Y3
X4), where X0 denotes an X gate applied to qubit 0, etc. Hence, Pauli strings
that provide no numerical contribution to expectation values with respect to

|Wacma) can be discarded for the purposes of calculating the energy. This
leads to vast reductions in the number of required measurements, reported in
Sec. 3.2.3. We refer to moments with Pauli strings removed by this procedure
as being “Pi, filtered”.

2.3 Quantum hardware, software and emulators

We have performed our experiments on the H1-1 and H2-1 Quantinuum
quantum computers. These computers have a quantum charge-coupled device
(QCCD) ion trap architecture, in which the qubits are encoded as hyperfine
states of electrostatically trapped Ytterbium (3+) ions [29, 30]. The quantum
gates acting on these qubits are implemented via a series of microwave laser
pulses located on specific points of the chip, the so-called gate zones. When-
ever a gate operation is applied to one or two qubits, the corresponding ions

are shuttled to a scheduled gate zone and exposed to the microwave pulse
corresponding to the gate. The main features of this hardware are:

e Allto all connectivity between qubits, which prevents the use of extra SWAP
gates (and extra noise) to implement complex circuits.

¢ Two-qubit fidelities above 99.8%.

e Mid-circuit measurements and qubit reuse.

e Long coherence times for the qubits.

H1-1 and H2-1 Quantinuum devices provide 20 and 56 qubits, respectively.
There are also classical emulators available, called H1-1E and H2-1E, which
can recreate, to high fidelity, noisy experiments of the devices.

All quantum computational calculations were performed using a develop-
ment version of our in-house software suite, InQuanto [31].

3 Results and Discussion

In this section we present and discuss the results obtained from QPE sim-
ulations and QCM4 measurements with emulator (H1-1E) runs as well as
quantum experiments on the H1-1 quantum computing system. But first, we
introduce the atomistic models used in the present study.

3.1 Classical models and reference calculations

We aim to model two hypothetical plutonium reactions; Firstly, the oxidation
of PuH2 in the gas phase (g) as an analogue for the oxidation of plutonium
hydride in the solid state [32, 33].

3 1
3PuH2(g) + 4029) + gPu20s(y) + 2PuHs(q) (4)

We generated a representative set of orbitals for the sesquioxide PugO3 and
the hydrides PuHz and PuHsy (structures depicted in Fig. 2, panel (a)). With
these orbitals, we defined subsets of them (the so-called active spaces or AS)
to balance description of the chemistry of each model with resources needed
to perform the quantum calculations. Each AS is specified by the number of
electrons and the number of orbitals that contribute to the wavefunction of
the chemical model considered.

The second reaction examined in this paper is the dissociation of
physisorbed Oz on a PuHpy surface (s) [34] defined by cuts along the
crystallographic (110) direction

O2@PuH2(110)(s) + 20@PuH2(110)(s). (5)

To this end, we first performed (at the DFT level) the geometry relaxation
of a single O2 molecule (S1, Fig. 2, panel (b)) and two oxygen atoms (S2,
Fig. 2, panel (b)) on top of a periodic crystalline PuH2(110) surface model. We
then truncated the periodic structures to small non-periodic clusters with sto-
ichiometry PusH1202, depicted in C1 and C2, Fig. 2, panel (b), respectively.
This was motivated by the observed weak perturbative effect of the oxygen
adsorption on the electron density of the PuHy, surface, affecting at most the
surface and first subsurface layers (see D1 and D2, Fig. 2, panel (b)). More
technical information about the creation of these models is provided in the
Sec. $3 of the SI.

An analysis of various spin states carried out at the DFT level in the PuH2,
PuHg and PuzO3 fragment models reveals that states with high multiplicity
(6, 5 and 10 unpaired electrons, respectively) are energetically most stable.
Similarly, for the PusHj202 model we found a multiplicity as high as 29 (28
unpaired electrons) most stable. These high spin states require all f-orbitals
of the Pu atoms to be included in the active space, which would require an

active space description of 14 qubits per Pu atom. Clearly, for the Puz2Os

structure and PusHj202 surface model this requirement exceeds our avail-
able quantum hardware resources. In contrast, using singlet multiplicity in our
classical CASSCF simulations (please refer to Sec. 3.4) shows reasonable con-
vergence of the O2-dissociation energy on the PusH)2 model with respect to
the active space, allowing for a description up to 20 qubits, AS(10e,100). To
overcome this issue, we decided to use singlet state results whenever the high-
spin ground states cannot be feasibly computed and the true ground state
results otherwise. This allows us to generate experiments for quantum hard-
ware on all systems considered in this study. In particular, we calculated the
energies of the Pu2O3, C1 and C2 structures in a closed-shell singlet state. In
contrast, we computed the energies of the PuH2 and PuH3 fragment models in
their high-spin ground state (5 and 6 unpaired electrons respectively) as the
presence of a single Pu atom in each of these models allowed us to consider
active spaces that could fit within the constraints of our hardware.

statistically independent device runs (100 resamples). Orange shaded region indicates the
standard deviation of the resampled results.

3.2 Scaling of resources with active space sizes of Pu2O3

In the following, we report the results for the variationally compiled QCELS
and QCM4 algorithms, for the plutonium sesquioxide (PuzO3) fragment in sin-
glet spin multiplicity with different active space (AS) selections. We analyzed
the PuzO3 structure as a proxy for the formation of plutonium sesquioxide
through the oxidation of plutonium dihydride (see Eq. 4 in gas-phase). To
determine a suitable AS for our experiments, we studied the energy depen-
dence of the PuzO3 molecular model with respect to the number of selected
orbitals. This step was performed by means of classical CASCI calculations,
since it allows for smoother energy change with AS size, owing to the fact that
orbitals are not reoptimized and therefore do not change between AS sizes.
In panel (a), of Fig. 3 we show the CASCI energy profile of Pu2O3 (singlet
spin state) as a function of the active space size, going from 2 electrons in 2
orbitals [(2e,20)] until 16 electrons in 16 orbitals [(16e,160)].

12 Quantum simulation of actinide chemistry with quantum computers

Focusing on the two-electron results (blue curve), we noticed that until 4
orbitals, the CASCI energy remains similar to that obtained from 2 electrons
in 2 orbitals, but decreases noticeably between 5 and 6 orbitals to then reach a
plateau until 9 orbitals. The inclusion of additional orbitals beyond an AS size
of 8 therefore does not result in a substantially improved CASCI energy (see
Fig. 3, panel (a)) but causes significantly larger computational costs (classi-
cally and quantum) for the variational recompilation. Hence, execution of the
circuits beyond (2e,80) would become very expensive compared to the gain in
the absolute value of the total energy. For these reasons, we decided to anal-
yse the performance of the statistical QPE algorithm for active spaces up to
2 electrons in 8 orbitals.

8.2.1 Statistical QPE Experiments on H1-1E and H1-1

In this section, we report results for the statistical QPE (with QCELS) algo-
rithm using both emulator and hardware runs; unless mentioned otherwise,
hese results were obtained with 100 shots per circuit (SPC). The measure-
ment circuits were prepared for 33 time steps over a total simulation time
hat includes at least two apparent periods for the overlaps, as can be seen
in Fig. 3 panel (bl). With this choice of time step and total simulation time,
the QCELS energies extracted from the state vector simulation are close to
she CASCI energies as it is shown in Tab. 2. For each of the 33 time steps in
he QPE calculations, we variationally compiled the circuits to prepare mea-
surement circuits for the real and imaginary parts of the overlap. For the
variational compilation we used an ansatz with repeated layers of rotations
and entangling gates (see Sec. $2 in the SI for additional information). Fig. 1,
panel (a3) depicts the first layer of the ansatz for a 2 + 1-qubit system. For
larger systems the structure is similar: each layer consists of single-qubit rota-
ions and a cascade of 2-qubit ZZPhase gates (native on Quantinuum devices)
that sequentially couple the ancilla to the system qubits. We found that this
ansatz works reasonably well up to 11 qubits with the allocated 2-qubit counts,
yielding a mean fidelity, across all time steps, of 96.2% (see Tab. 1). Beyond
11 qubits the mean fidelity drops significantly. However, the errors in the over-
laps, crucial for QCELS post-processing, remain much smaller. Fig. 5 shows
we performed hardware measurements up to 19 qubits.

We initially considered an AS of 2 electrons in 2 molecular orbitals. By
exploiting symmetries such as particle and spin conservation [35], we were able
to reduce the 4 Jordan-Wigner mapped [36] qubits to 2 plus one additional
ancillary qubit (three qubits in total), necessary to perform our experiments
(with the total of 12 2-qubit gates). We prepared our initial state by including
all determinants with coefficients greater than 0.03 in the CI expansion (after
carrying out a CASCI(2e, 20) calculation), to maximize the overlap between
initial and target ground state. For larger active spaces, we used the same 0.03
threshold for the determinant inclusion in the initial state. In all cases the
initial states have larger than 96% fidelity with the exact ground state, which
is sufficient for the QCELS method [12].

The overlap (w|v(t)) measured after 100 SPC on the quantum device is
shown for the real and imaginary parts (red curve) in Fig. 3, panel (b1). We
noticed a good agreement with the state vector (SV) results (blue curve),
with only minor deviations arising from statistical noise of the hardware
measurements.
The agreement with theory is also reflected in the estimated phases
obtained with the QCELS approach (as shown in Fig. 3, panel (b2)) from the
complex time series of the overlap evolution (see Eq. $9 in SI). The phases
correspond to total energies of —187.51989 Ha and —187.51924 Ha for state
vector and hardware, respectively. Our hardware experiments using 100 shots
are thus very accurate. With a deviation only 0.7 mHa from the state vec-
tor energy, we find our quantum experiments to yield results well within the
threshold of chemical accuracy.
We now proceed to analyze results for more complex active spaces. In
Tab. 2 we provide an overview of the different experiments in terms of active
spaces, number of qubits, 2-qubit gates depth, state vector QPE energy, ener-
gies obtained from emulator and hardware runs, and the difference between
emulator (or hardware) and state vector results. We can see that, as the active
space size increases (and therefore the number of qubits and 2-qubit depths
are larger), the differences in energy between state vector (SV) and emula-
tor increase, with the maximum difference being around 6 mHa for the active
space of (2e,80). We attribute this effect to the ansatz that is unable to capture
the full complexity of the exact state, which is also reflected by the deviation
between the SV simulation with the original |W) and variationally compiled
|W(0)) (see Figs. S1 and $2 in the SI).
For the hardware runs, we can see a similar trend as the emulator runs,
namely the differences in energy between state vector and hardware increase
with increasing active space, being around 5 mHa for an active space (2e,80).
For this AS, we find that increasing the number of shots to 500 SPC reduces
the difference to the state vector result back to 3 mHa, indicating the need for
higher statistical averaging in this case (see also Fig. $3 in the SI).

3.2.2 QCM4 Experiments on H1-1E and H1-1

H1-1 experiments for PugO3 were performed using the largest active space
accessible by this method, 2 electrons in 6 orbitals, which translates to 12
qubits.

To measure all Pauli terms required for QCM4, 2412 measurement circuits
are required (after grouping the terms into commuting sets). To reduce this
quantum resource requirement, Pauli strings with coefficients below a thresh-
old are removed after the full set of Pauli strings required for all 4 Hamiltonian
moments is obtained. We find that a Pauli coefficient threshold of 0.001 pro-
vides a good approximation to the QCM4 energy, with error ~0.1 mHa. At
this threshold, the number of Pauli circuits to be measured after grouping into
fully commuting sets (as implemented in TKET [37]) reduces to 516.

The corresponding results are shown in panel (c), Fig. 3. To establish a
standard deviation for our experiments, the hardware result is bootstrapped
to emulate 100 resamples of the same measurement procedure; the resulting
standard deviation amounts to 0.18 Ha (orange shaded region). This error
largely originates from two aspects related to statistical precision. First, from
the large number of measureable circuits that remain even after omitting Pauli
strings below the threshold and grouping into commuting sets. Second, from
the relatively small number of shots (500 SPC).

Furthermore, the Pin filtering procedure (see Sec. 2.2) was performed for
Pu2O3 and this resulted in 2 circuits to measure after also accounting for
commuting sets (see also Sec. 3.2.3). The contributions to the QCM4 energies
can be reconstructed from these 2 circuits, allowing for highly accurate QCM4
energies even in the presence of device noise and measurement sampling error
(10,000 SPC was used for the Pauli filtered QCM4 results for PugO3). This is
shown by 5 independent runs of the QCM4 method on the H1-1 emulator, the
results of which are reported in Tab. 3.

As also highlighted for the hydrides in Sec. 3.3.2, the QCM4 method gen-
erally compares well with statistical (variationally recompiled) QPE, and with
the ideal classical result, once Pauli filtering is used. The low number of mea-
surements and relatively shallow circuits allow for a high accuracy of the
emulated QCM4 experiment. However, when all Pauli terms are measured (no
filtering), measurement noise leads to larger errors in the QCM4 method, where
even for smaller SPC the statistical QPE approach achieves a higher accuracy.
We also note the ability of variationally compiled QPE to reach larger active
spaces, since the number of measurable Pauli terms involved in QCM4 for the
(2e,80) active space becomes too large to be tractable with current methods,
as discussed further in section 3.2.3.

when fully accounting for commuting sets of Pauli terms (Neircuits)- For small active
spaces, note the saturation in the number of Pauli strings for higher moments [38]. For the
(2,8) active space, the QCM4 moments for n > 1 are not calculated due to large
computational overhead, and hence Ly +1 are omitted.

saturate as a function of n [15, 38]. The precise scaling is system dependent
and determined by the commutativity of individual Pauli strings comprising
H and the strings resulting from product terms of H">?. For the QCM4 simu-
lations carried out on Pu2O3, we show in Tab. 4 the specific numbers of Pauli
terms with respect to Nuits and n, along with the corresponding number
of circuits to measure when fully accounting for the commuting properties of
Pauli strings.

The large number of measurements is a major bottleneck in QCM4 calcula-
tions. Even when commutativity is taken into account, the number of circuits
to measure for larger active spaces is prohibitive; for the (2e,80) active space,
Ly is already 5793, which potentially translates into millions of terms for L,s1.
When considering Pauli filtering for the (2e,80) active space, the large number
of Pauli terms translates to a large number of Pauli string expectation val-
ues to evaluate classically, requiring large classical compute resources. Overall,
the overhead caused by the number of Pauli terms required by QCM4 seems
indeed more restrictive than the corresponding QPE simulations. The largest
QCM4 calculation we report in this paper therefore corresponds to the 12
qubit, (2e,60) active space of Pu2O3.

3.3 The molecular hydrides: PuHz and PuHs

Unlike plutonium sesquioxide, we found that, in order to describe the nature
of the correlation of the molecular proxies of PuHg and PuHs, all plutonium
forbitals must necessarily be included in the active space.

A CASCI description of these systems would imply very large active spaces,
beyond the reach of currently feasible quantum experiments. For this reason,
we opted for the state-average CASSCF (SA-CASSCF, with 5 roots) proce-
dure to avoid a poor description of the virtual orbitals at the HF level and
consequently to include an optimised set of f-orbitals within a smaller active
space. We then used these orbitals as initial guesses for the ground states. Since
the fully spin-polarized state is used, only one spin type (spin-up) is included
in the active space, which results in Hamiltonian Pauli strings containing X
or Y rotations having no effect on the energy (maintaining spin symmetry).
Quantum simulation of actinide chemistry with quantum computers 17

As reported in Sec. 2.2, this effect on the Pauli strings continues for higher
order moments of the Hamiltonian, resulting in nonzero expectation values
only for those Pauli strings consisting of Z rotations, for all moments required

for QCM4.

3.3.1 Statistical QPE Experiments on H1-1E and H1-1

The hardware results for PuH2 are reported in Tab. 5. The active space
required for a suitable description of this fragment amounts to at least 6 elec-
trons in 8 orbitals, with a septet spin multiplicity, implying that all 6 electrons
in the active space are spin-aligned. In such a fully spin-polarized AS no oppo-

site spin orbitals can contribute to the electronic structure description. After
removal of these orbitals, we are left with 6 electrons and 8 alpha spin-orbitals,
leading to a total of 9 qubits (8 + 1 ancillary qubit needed for the phase). The
corresponding quantum computational experiment with 100 SPC yields a total
energy of -71.44511 Ha, which is in nearly complete agreement with the refer-
ence energy of -71.44508 Ha from the state vector QPE simulation. Increasing
the SPC count to 500 slightly increases the difference with the theoretical
value, but only by ImHa.
The same strategy was adopted for the experiments of PuH3 on quantum

hardware, the results of which are also shown in Tab. 5. In this case the active
space required to describe the electronic structure of the PuH3 fragment was
5 electrons in 7 orbitals with a sextet spin multiplicity (28+1 with S=5/2).
As before, the fully spin-polarized active space can be reduced to effectively 5
electrons and 7 alpha spin-orbitals, therefore requiring only 8 qubits (7 qubits
for the wave function description + 1 ancilla qubit needed for the statistical
QPE). The state vector QPE energy is -72.00839 Ha, while the hardware run
(with 100 SPC) yields -72.00522 Ha, with an energy difference of about 3 mHa
between the two. The error of this experiment therefore exceeds chemical
accuracy moderately. Increasing the shot count to 500 SPC leaves the result
largely unaltered, with 4 mHa difference instead of 3 mHa with respect to the
state vector result.

8.3.2 QCM4 Experiments on H1-1E and H1-1

In Fig. 4 we show the results of measuring the QCM4 energies of PuHy and
PuH3 using the H1-1 emulator. For these fragments, accounting for commu-
tativity of Pauli terms (without Pauli filtering or truncating) results in 7
quantum circuits to be measured. To investigate the distribution of errors in
the QCM4 energies, the measurement results of the moment expectation values
are bootstrapped to generate ensembles from the original measurement results.
For each SPC value shown in Fig. 4, 500 resamples of the H1-1E measurements
are taken.

The results show a consistently decreasing standard deviation with an
increasing number of measurement shots. For PuH2 and PuHs, respectively,
standard deviations of 1.6 mHa and 1 mHa are obtained at 104 SPC. The

resamples. Blue circles correspond to QCM4 energies averaged over the bootstrapped ensem-
ble, while orange error bars represent the standard deviations. Top: PuH2; bottom: PuH3.

corresponding errors of these experiments amount to 16 mHa and 18 mHa,
respectively.

To obtain QCM4 energies for PuH3 and PuH, from H1-1 hardware, the
Pauli filtering procedure was performed before compiling the measurement
circuits. However, applying this technique resulted in all Pb, containing only
Z strings, for both PuH3 and PuHg. All these Pauli strings commute with each
other, requiring the measurement of only a single circuit. Since only the +1
eigenvalues of the Z operator are required, the result can be trivially extracted
in the computational Z basis (simply taking +1 or —1 according to the Z
string). Hence, the ideal energy is reliably reproduced when Pauli filtering
reduces the moments to Pauli strings containing only Z operators.

To summarize; applying QCM4 without error mitigation or Pauli filtering
techniques to the hydrides PuH2 and PuHsg results in larger errors compared to
statistical QPE (see values in Tab. 5), even at 104 SPC. When Pauli filtering is
used, the QCM4 yields a near-exact energy simply from the eigenvalues of the
resulting Z strings. The energies obtained from Pauli-filtered QCM4 therefore
match the statistical QPE results very well.

3.4 Reaction energy of O2 dissociation on PuHz2 surface

In the previous sections, we analyzed molecular-fragment systems, as their
orbital subspace is easily reduced to a size tractable with quantum comput-
ers. However, a realistic description of the plutonium oxidation and corrosion
processes requires an atomistic modeling of extended surfaces.
n this section, we therefore study the O2 dissociation on truncated and
capped surface models of crystalline PuH2. To this end, we relaxed the
extended surface models of PuH2 (with O2 physisorbed and Op» dissociated)
with a periodic DFT formalism and subsequently converted them into cluster
models containing 5 Pu atoms (C1 and C2 shown in Fig. 2, panel (b)). While
the resulting electronic structures are significantly more complex than the
models previously discussed, they nonetheless remain accessible to electronic
structure calculation.
Based on the analysis of the electronic structure of the fragments PuH2
and PuH3 discussed in Sec. 3.3, we expect a very high spin multiplicity also
for the electronic ground states of the cluster models of the PuH2 surface. As
a quantum computational description of such high-spin polarizations would
lead to qubit counts exceeding available quantum resources, the total energies
and corresponding dissociation energetics of these systems were obtained from
a closed-shell (singlet) description of the electronic structure. Note that this
is analogous to the treatment of Pu2O3, with the only difference that the
electronic structure description is based on CASSCF-optimized orbitals rather
than Hartree-Fock orbitals.
In Fig. 5, panel (a), we show the classically computed CASSCF oxygen dis-
sociation energies on the 5Pu clusters, i.e. AE=E(20@PuH>2)-E(O2@PuHg),
obtained for different active space sizes. We find the resulting AE to converge
to -6.7 eV at an active space of 10 electrons in 10 orbitals.

20 Quantum simulation of actinide chemistry with quantum computers

In Tab. 6 we report the total electronic structure energies for both reactant
and product (C1 and C1 in Fig. 2, respectively).

We compare classical CASSCF results to state vector simulations of QPE
and to quantum experiments (using 100 and 500 SPC). To this end, we also list
the deviation of the quantum computed results from the state vector reference.
All these results were obtained at the active space of 10 electrons in 10 orbitals.

After taking the symmetry of these systems into account and leverag-
ing variational recompilation, the quantum experiments comprise a total
of 19 qubits (18 qubits for the state register + 1 ancillary qubit for the
Hadamard test) and 2-qubit gate depths of 108. To the best of our knowledge,
these experiments are the largest QPE calculations of a realistic electronic
structure problem successfully executed on quantum hardware, surpassing pre-
vious QPE hardware experiments on one-dimensional organic chains of up
to 13 qubits [39]. However, we note that they also performed 33-qubit QPE
experiments for 1-D Hubbard models.

First, we observe the state vector QPE simulations to produce virtually
identical total energies as the classical CASSCF, validating our quantum com-
putational approach. Comparing then state vector simulations with quantum
experiments, we find a difference of around 5-6 mHa, which decreases to 0.9-2.6
mHa (see Tab. 6). This error reduction is a direct result of the higher num-
ber of samples from which the experimental result is obtained. This increased
precision at 500 SPC brings this value very close to the chemical accuracy
threshold of 1.6 mHa.
Finally, we compare the reaction energies resulting from classical CASSCF
calculations with those obtained from our quantum computational experiments
(with 500 SPC). The quantum computational result of -6.69 eV deviates only
by 0.04 eV (1 kcal/mol) from the CASSCF reaction energy -6.73 eV. This
demonstrates the ability of present-day QPE implementation to match the
results of classical approaches in experiments executed on quantum hardware
with chemical accuracy. In Fig. 5, panel (bl), we further report the overlaps
(for both real and imaginary parts) measured after 500 SPC on the quantum
device (red curve), and the overlaps calculated with state vector (blue curve)
for the cluster system 20@PuHy. We notice a general good agreement between
the two curves, with only a few outliers being noticeable. We attribute the
latter to the variational compilation procedure which becomes increasingly
more approximate for higher dimensional Hilbert spaces and deeper circuits;

see Fig. $5 in the SI for more detailed comparisons and information. As the
QCELS method is a statistical approach, the individual data points do not lead
to significant differences in the quantum phases obtained from simulations and
quantum experiments; the total difference in phases amounts to only 0.002,
see Fig. 5, panel (b2).

S1 Energy Estimation via QCELS

For an n-qubit electronic problem we write the Hamiltonian as a sum of
Hamiltonian fragments
H=hol+h >> Hy, (S1)
f
where each Hy is a linear combination of mutually commuting Pauli strings.
The scalings
1 4 7
ho = gn eH), hy= sll ~ hol (S2)

ensure that the reduced operator H:= Ys Hy has eigenvalues in [-3, +3].
If the ground state |) is known,

Z(t) = (bole |abo) =e, (83)
2 SI: Quantum simulation of actinide chemistry with quantum computers
and the ground-state energy is
Eo = ho + hyo. (S4)
however typically the ground state is not known and an initial state is a |w)
for which | (qo|~) | >> 0. Following the QCELS procedure we sample the time
ty, = nt with n=0,...,N —1 and fixed 7. With measuring
Zn = Z(tn) = wlemtn# |), ($5)

we use the QCELS objective

(S6)

whose maximiser 6* yields the energy estimate
EX = hy +d". (S7)
Each Z,, is obtained with a single-ancilla Hadamard test, in which we prepare

|W(tn)) = V2

(10) ® lw) +1) @ U(r)" y)), (S8)

where U(r) = ei” and we measure the real and imaginary parts via
RZ, = (U(tn)|X @1|W(tn)), — TZ = (U(tn)|Y @I|W(tn)). — (S9)

$1.1 Trotterization costs for the time evolution operator

We define the costs as the 2-qubit circuit depth. We approximate the time
evolution operator with a first-order Trotter approximation,

U(r) = eit ny lor", (S10)
f

where the fragments are ordered by ascending operator norm in the Trotter
product, that is, the largest norm is applied to the reference first. To prepare
|W(tn)) we would need the controlled time evolution operator for time t,,, that
is we would need to evaluate cost for the circuit of controlled-U(r)”. Since the
cost is proportional to n, we only calculated cost for the circuit of a single
trotter step Il; e-'7 4 For the costs in Tab. 1 of the main text, the circuit
optimizations are performed with pytket, using TermSequenceBox and greedy

optimization, [1] and fully commuting sets determined by largest-first graph
coloring method. [2, 3]
SI: Quantum simulation of actinide chemistry with quantum computers 3

$2 Variational compilation for hardware
experiments

To demonstrate the capability of QCELS on realistic fragments, we first car-
ried out exact time evolution with state vector simulation: we computed each
|W(tn)) state vector and evaluated the corresponding Z,, values for the QCELS
objective function.

For hardware runs we variationally compiled every exact state |W(t,)) into
the ansatz

|¥(o)) =u) " u@. uf] |+) @ |0..0) (S11)

where stot ~
ofl = TL weton) aos) x2) (s12)

and nd
v= TT Repco), (813)

q=1

and nq is the number of qubits including the ancilla and L is the number
of layers indirectly controlling the circuit depth and the number of varia-
tional parameters. An example of the beginning of ansatz circuit representation
shown for the 2+1-qubit case in panel (a3), Fig. 1 in the main text. The com-
pilation employed pytket—Qujax/InQuanto together with the optax Adam
optimiser for 500 iterations and randomized initial parameters, minimising
the objective |||W(tn)) — |Y(9)) \|’. The variational compilation was performed
independently for each t,,, using the same ansatz, so the circuit-resource profile
is identical across all time steps, while the optimal parameters ¥ vary with t,.

$3 DFT geometry optimization of structures
and periodic systems

Based on previous structural studies on plutonium hydrides [4] and oxides, [5]
for our models of PuH,, with x = 2,3, and sesquioxide Pu2O3, we built an ab
initio model by carrying out simulations in gas phase by using the Quantum
Espresso (QE) Density Functional Theory (DFT) package. [6, 7] We performed
non collinear spin-orbit coupling (SOC) calculations with DFT-D3 van der
Waals dispersion correction [8] for geometry optimization of structures of inter-
est. In all DFT calculations, we employed the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)
GGA exchange correlation functional [9] together with projector-augmented
wave (PAW) pseudopotentials. [10] We used the wave function and charge den-
sity cut-offs of 75 Ry and 600 Ry, respectively, together with a Brillouin zone
sampling at the T point and a Marzari-Vanderbilt smearing of 0.005 Ry. The
number of Kohn-Sham states was increased by approximately 20% to assist
4 SI: Quantum simulation of actinide chemistry with quantum computers

with convergence of the SOC simulations. At this level of theory, we found a
reaction energy of —9.286 eV.

We also built a supercell (1x2x6) for cubic Fm-3m PuH, (110) periodic
surface, since it was suggested as the most stable reactive surface system by
Smith et al. [11] This model was geometrically relaxed. We then generated
the initial and final states by depositing O2 and 2 oxygen atoms on top of the
surface, respectively (structures $1 and S2, panel (b), Fig. 2 in the main text,
inspired by the most stable model 3P1 found in reference: Shi et al. [12]). The
geometries of the adsorbates and the first two layers of the surface were further
relaxed.

We adopted a DFT setup similar to that used for the simulations describec
at the beginning of the present section. In this particular case, we needed
to correct the PBE functional by applying an Hubbard energy U = 4.88 eV
to the plutonium f-orbitals. The U was derived from scratch by means o
the Density Functional Perturbation Theory (DFPT) tool [13] included in
the Quantum Espresso package and with a non-polarised PBE+SOC DFT
calculation. We finally found a lattice parameter a = 5.380 A in accordance
with an experimental value a = 5.395 A (as reported by Zheng et al. [14
together with theoretical calculations).

Since the entire periodic model was extremely complex to be treated a
the Hartree-Fock (HF) level of theory with the basis set of choice, we studiec
how the electron density of the surface was modified by the presence of oxygen
atoms. In this way, we identified a smaller active region that was cut from the
surface as an isolated cluster of 5 plutonium atoms (structures Cl and C2,
panel (b), Fig. 2 in the main text). The obtained clusters were electronically
relaxed inside the spin-polarised framework to obtained the correct multi-
spin ground state 25+1=29, with a dissociation energy at DFT level Ey;, =
E(C2) — E(C1) = —5.547 eV.

For the whole set of final models, we adopted a cubic box of length between
16 and 20 A and applied the Martyna-Tuckerman correction, [15] in order to
avoid the interaction among the atoms from adjacent unit cells.

$3.1 Classical quantum chemistry methods

The restricted(R)- and restricted open-shell(RO)-HF mean-field calculations
as well as post-HF multi reference calculations (namely CASCI, CASSCF
and SA-CASSCF) have been performed with the CRENBL basis set with
relativistic effective core potential (ECP) for plutonium [16] and oxygen [17]
and 6-311G** basis set for hydrogen, as implemented in the PySCF quantum
chemistry suite. [18, 19] We leave more accurate treatment of relativistic
effects, such as with exact 2-component or 4-component Hamiltonians, to
future work. The Newton solver (Second-order SCF solver) has been used in
all calculations.

divergence due to approximation in the recompilation procedure; ii) between recompilation
and hardware experiments represents divergence due to noise in the quantum measurements.
Values of the standard deviations over the hardware measured overlaps due to shots sampling
