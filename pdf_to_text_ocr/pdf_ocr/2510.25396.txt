Abstract

In this paper, we consider the Euclidean partition function of charged and uncharged AdS black

hole geometries in d+ 1-dimensions. It is seen that the partition function can be reduced to a one-

dimensional integral, which can be investigated using methods of Picard-Lefschetz. The saddles

of the system correspond to either naked-singular geometry, thermal-AdS, small-, intermediate-

or large-sized black hole for different ranges of

parameter space. These are solutions of Einstein’s

equation, which are dominant saddles in the partition function in various regimes of parameter

space. A naive analysis of the partition function involving these saddles would lead to conflicts

with the standard understanding of black hole t'

hermodynamics and also with AdS/CFT. However,

when the partition function is analysed using Picard-Lefschetz, it is seen that naked-singular ge-

ometries don’t contribute. The saddles corresponding to them are irrelevant, aligning well with the

Cosmic Censorship hypothesis. Saddles corresponding to negative specific heat are either small-

or intermediate-sized black holes. Although they are relevant in the partition function but are

sub-dominant. They also drop out under homology averaging. Saddles corresponding to only

non-negative specific heat contribute to the Eu
allowability of these complex geometries using

I. INTRODUCTION

Thermal partition function given by Z7(3) which is a weighted sum of energy eigenstates,
is wonderfully described by Euclidean path-integral for non-gravitational systems. If the
system has a Hamiltonian H that is bounded from below then one has

Z(8) =Tre*", (1)

where the trace Tr is defined as the summation over all the energy eigenstates. In the case
of gravity, in a sense the same is true as pointed out long ago by Gibbons and Hawking
[1], where the gravitational path-integral 7(/3) is defined as path-integral over some class
of metrics with Euclidean signature boundary St x Y where S* has proper length {. It is
well-known that path-integrals get dominant contribution from saddle configurations, which
are configurations satisfying equation of motion of the action describing the system. This

2
thing works well in non-gravitational cases where the saddles correspond to configuration
with least energy. In gravitational systems, things are not so straight forward.

Euclidean gravitational path-integral suffers from conformal factor problem, where the
path-integral over the conformal factor is unbounded from below [2]. This issue arises even
before one can address choice of integration contour. A simple treatment proposed earlier
was to rotate the contour of integration of the scale-factor, which although is adhoc but does
the task. This procedure has been utilized by several authors giving physically satisfying
results [3}9] where the choice of contour is adhoc lacking justification from first principles.

A better proposal is to deal with the Lorentzian path-integral where one doesn’t hit
the conformal factor problem directly in the sense that the path-integral is defined over
Lorentzian geometries with the contour of integration taken to be defined by real Lorentzian-
signature metrics. The notion then is carefully scrutiny the possible deformation of integra-
tion contour in the complex plane to come up with an equivalent “Euclidean” path-integral
which right from beginning comes along with a specific integration contour where meaning-
ful computation can be performed. This approach has been considered by various authors
in both continuum and discrete formulation of path-integral of gravity [TO}21].

The benefit of using a Lorentzian formulation of path-integral for gravity is that it is
not ruled out for obvious reasons like un-boundedness or blowups happening in Euclidean
path-integral of gravity. This is because the Lorentzian gravitational action Igya, for smooth
real Lorentzian metrics is purely real, hence implying that integrand of the path-integral
exp(iJgrav) is a pure phase leading to an oscillatory integral! Is there a way to define the Eu-
clidean path-integral 7(,---) (where the (---) represent charges, angular momentum, etc.)
via Lorentzian path-integral by some transformation? This was investigated in [22], where
the author proposes to consider Lorentzian path-integral as path-integral over all Lorentzian
metrics including co-dimension-2 singularities, and uses a smearing function fs(T’) to covert
the Lorentzian path-integral to a “Euclidean” one. The smearing function is defined by

[arity em =e, (2)

for all w above the ground state of Hamiltonian. This immediately gives that the Euclidean
partition function can be written as

Z(8) =Tre*# = / ” ar fe(T) Tre” , (3)

where Z,(T) = Tre~™” can be thought of as one parameter family of path-integral over
Lorentzian metrics [22]. If the Euclidean path-integral involves Black hole as saddles, then
the Lorentzian path-integral must allow inclusion of co-dimension-2 singularities in the path-
integral. If these co-dimension-2 surfaces are denoted by 7, then

z(t) = f as 2,(T:5), (4)

where S = Area(y)/4Gy and Z;(T; S) is the path-integral over Lorentzian metrics of fixed
S' (or fixed area of the co-dimension-2 surface y). Saddle configurations of Z,(T; S) then
becomes constrained-saddles of the Z,(T'). These constrained saddles can become relevant
depending on the integration contour and can contribute non-trivially in the path-integral
once the integration contour is deformed using Picard-Lefschetz methodology [22} [23].

3
In the saddle point approximation, Z,;(T;$) gets dominant contribution from the co-
dimension-2 surface which is the saddle of the action Ig,,,. These correspond to blackhole
geometries of fixed area. This implies

Z1(T; S) ag eilerav = gr es) (5)

where E(S) is the energy for the BH saddle of fixed S [22) [23]. Plugging this back into
eq. (4. we get an expression for the contribution of the black hole saddle in the Lorentzian
path-integral to be
Z,(T) = | ds eS TES) | (6)
0
Using the smearing function this can be integral transformed following eq. to obtain the
black hole contribution to the Euclidean path-integral to be

Z(B) = | dS dT fs(T) e& “TES = | ds eS PRS) | (7)
0 0

where it is understood that the T integration has to be performed first before the integration
over S. The same expression can be obtained from the trace, if one notices that e* can be
identified as the density of states corresponding to a system with energy E(S). In the case
when there is charge the above becomes two dimensional integral

Z(8,®) = | “as / dQ cS 8#25:2) with Eo(S,Q) = E(S)— 6Q. (8)

The essence of this procedure is that we donot deal with the conformal factor problem of the
Euclidean path-integral, instead uses Lorentzian path-integral to define a Euclidean one via
an integral transform, which for the case of black hole geometries reduces to known partition
function.

Once we have comfortably defined the Euclidean partition function Z(G) for the case of
black hole geometries, we proceed to study it in detail for the case of AdS-Schwarzschild
non-charged and charged black holes in arbitrary dimensions. Our starting point in this
study is eq. and eq. @®). This is a one/two-dimensional integral which can be evaluated
by analysing it in complex plane. As this targets geometries which correspond to black hole
solutions, it is worth exploring what are the possible saddles of the system and what do
they correspond to. Furthermore, it is crucial to investigate which saddles give dominant
contribution to the partition function for various values of parameter 6 (and charge Q in
case of charged BHs) and whether they are compatible with the known results of AdS/CFT
for various dimensions.

It may happen that certain saddles which are dominant in the path-integral for a range of
external parameters (3 and charge q (or chemical potential ©), need not be compatible with
the known wisdom of AdS/CFT. In such cases it is worth asking whether such saddles become
“relevant” in the partition function when the integration mentioned in eq. is performed in
the complex plane using Picard-Lefschtz methods (Morse theory). An interesting situation
seen in the recent work [24] [25] that there are “relevant” saddles not contributing in the
partition function. Contributions from such saddles are noticed to drop out in the partition
function due to homology averaging. This paper investigates such situations in more detail
for the case of charged and un-charged black holes in d+ 1-dimensions.

The outline of the paper is as follows: In Sec. we revisit the puzzle and findings
reported in [24] for asymptotically AdS Schwarzschild spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions.
Here, we discuss the implementation of Picard Lefschetz and homology averaging for generic
complex saddles, along with associated thermodynamic stability analysis. In Sec. we
extend this study to the charged AdS case, considering arbitrary dimensions for the grand
canonical ensemble (fixed potential) and some specific dimensions for the canonical ensemble
(fixed charge). Sec. [IVjis devoted for the analysis of weaker verison of KSW criterion and its
compatibility with the puzzle raised in the earlier sections. Finally, summary of our findings
and conclusions are presented in section

II. SCHWARZSCHILD ADS BLACK HOLE IN d+1 DIMENSION

We first consider the case of AdSq,, Euclidean Schwarzschild black hole with the bound-
ary 55 x S41! (d > 3) at a given inverse temperature 8. Such a black hole has a line
element

dr?
ds? = f(rdr? + Fy + Pda, rw rep,
. —_ (9)
f(r) =14+ 5 - > 0.

This is solution to equation of motion following from Einstein-Hilbert action with appropri-
ate surface terms and counterterms to cancel the large volume divergence [26]. For ps = 0,
it describes a thermal AdS solution without any horizon. However, when p > 0, we get a
horizon at r+, which is the largest positive real root of f(r,) =O andr, <r<o.r>ry
ensures the existence of a timelike killing vector everywhere outside the horizon, regularity
at the horizon enforces 3 to be 47/f’(r;). The entropy S and Energy F as function of ry

are given by
d-1 d

S — Wht E _ a2, T+) 10
(=, mer) EE (ue (10)
where w is the area of (d—1) dimensional unit sphere, and given by w = 27“/?/T'(d/2). In eq.
(ZO), we omitted the zero-point Casimir energy Eo(d) of empty AdS and set E(r, = 0) =0,
as it plays no role in what follows. The exponent in the integrand in eq. takes the
form Z(r4) = S(rz) — BE(r+). The measure dS becomes a measure over r+ with range
of integration 0 < ry < co (the Jacobian generated in the transformation can be ignored
as we are working in the saddle-point approximation). The Euclidean partition function
mentioned in eq. reduces to

& writ Co oe x6
Z(B) ~ | arsexp | ia Bee (ns +) -| dr yet) | (11)

where 3 is any arbitrary positive parameter. A similar setup is also considered in the liter-
ature [24], where the authors specifically study in d = 4 and briefly comment on arbitrary
dimensions. Studies along these lines were also taken in 27| in d = 3. The saddle configura-
tions can be determined by considering the exponent in eq. and extremizing the Z(r,).
This gives the saddle-point equation

This is an algebraic equations whose roots can be found easily. These are given by

The root appearing at r; = 0 correspond to thermal AdS solution which exists for all £.
The other solutions re correspond to real black hole saddle geometries for 8 < Bmax, with

For 6 > Bmax, these rt saddles becomes complex. For 3 > Bmax, T+ = 0 (thermal AdS) is
the only real saddle. When 6 = Bmax both saddles merge. For later convenience, we will
write the above saddle configurations in terms of Snax. These are given by

It is worth highlighting that the regularity condition is satisfied for all 8 and is not restricted
only to 8 < Bmax Where we have real black hole solutions.

If one computes the Kretschmann scalar (see appendix [A). then for such configurations
we have

where we define

d(d—1)?(d— 2)? , 2d(d +1)

K(r) = » where p? = roy + a)’. (17)
From eq (17). it is evident that at r = 0, K(r = 0) blows up in d > 3, signifying the presence
of curvature singularity irrespective of whether r; is real or complex (which happens for
B> Bmax). For B > Bmax, these saddle configurations are singularities without a horizon, a
naked singularity. Such naked singularities are solutions of Einstein’s equations.

In the following subsections, we will study the partition function for various regimes of
2, analysing the saddle configurations, their dominance and relevance, and compute the
partition function using the methods of Picard-Lefschetz. To do so, we will need to compute
study the argument of the exponent in eq. at the various saddles. Z(r;) at various
saddles is given by

L(ry = 0) =0,
Z(ry = rt) = = 2 excp{t(d — 18} [-1  (d— 1) tanh 9] 8)

4G. d(4+1)/2

From here we see that for thermal-AdS saddle Z(r, = 0) =0. For 8 < Bmax, Z(r4) at other
two saddles re is purely real as @ is purely real. For 8 > Bmax, 6 —> i6, becomes purely
imaginary quantity with 6 being real, leading to complex I (r4) at the two complex saddles
which correspond to naked-singularity.

and hence don’t contribute to the partition function.

A. Z(8) for 8 > Bmax

In this regime, we have one real saddle and two complex saddle configurations. The real
saddle corresponds to thermal AdS geometry, while the complex-conjugate saddle correspond
to naked singular geometries. As noticed in 24], these complex saddles give dominant
contribution in the partition function for certain range of values of 3, as can be seen by
computing Z(r,). Naively, it will be expected that being dominant saddles, they are the
ones whose contribution will be most important in the classical limit. However, the situation
changes if such saddles, despite being dominant becomes irrelevant in the computation of
the partition function using Picard-Lefschetz methods. This situation was analysed for the
case of d = 4 in [24]. In our paper we examine the situation in arbitrary dimensions.

In order to compute the partition function for 8 > Bmax, we start by analysing Re(Z(r+))
at various saddles. It will indicate the saddles which will become dominant as ( varies. It is
seen from eq. that for arbitrary d, Z(r;) for thermal AdS is always zero. For 3 > Bmax,
the other two saddles rt are complex conjugate and correspond to naked singularities. For
them Z(r,) is complex as seen from eq. (18). To analyse the dominance, one needs to
extract the real part of Re{Z(r4)| for each of these complex saddles. If the Re[Z(r+)| > 0 for
certain values of 6, then these naked singularities become dominant over the thermal-AdS
saddle, which will be in conflict with the results of AdS/CFT. For 8 > Bmax, the Re[Z(r=)]
is given by

It is easy to see from here that for certain values of 3, say for example large-3 (3 — oo),
cos((d — 1)@) = 0 or +1, while sin((d — 1)@) = +1 or 0 (depending on the dimension
d), respectively. In the case when it is —1 (for example, d = 4), then naked singularities
are dominant in the partition function! More generically, for large-G, when d = 4n,n €
(1, 2,3, ..), Re[Z(r=)] ~ +(8/Bmax) > 0 thereby claiming dominance over thermal-AdS. This
was already noticed in 24] for AdSs(n = 1). When d = 4n —1, for large-8, Re{Z(r=)| < 0
(independent of 3) and thermal-AdS remains a dominant saddle. However, for d = 4n + 1,
Re[Z(r=)] > 0 and is independent of 6, thereby again dominating over the thermal-AdS
saddle. For d = 4n + 2, Re[Z(r=)| ~ —(8/Bmax) for large-8 thereby making thermal-AdS
dominant saddle. We summarize this in the table[]] On doing a numerical plot of Re[Z(r=)]

as a function of arbitrary 8 > Bmax, we notice from fig. the values of 3 for which naked
singularities give dominant contribution in the partition function.

From this discussion, it is clear that for certain values of ( for the case of 3 > Bmax, naked
singular geometries, which are complex saddles, are dominant. Naively, one would expect
that they would control the nature of the partition function in the classical limit, as they are
most dominant, though they correspond to complex metrics (r+ being complex implies ju is

8
complex). Occurrences of complex metrics are not new in the literature. They have shown
up in studies of quantum cosmology and black holes [17] [19] 271{35] and real-time holography
as well [36}{38], where they have lead to physically meaningful results. However, in our case
if they are to be considered, then our findings will be in tension with the understanding of
black hole thermodynamics. Furthermore, if these additional saddles are considered, new
phase transitions will occur among these complex saddles. This will also be in conflict with
AdS-CFT, where it is well understood that thermal AdS reproduces results consistent with
the dual CFT in the low temperature regime [39}/41].

This is the puzzle first raised in the note [24], where naive computation of the partition
function based on saddle dominance lead to tension with AdS/CFT. However, if the partition
function is computed carefully, making use of Picard-Lefschetz methods and tools from
Morse theory, then the puzzle is resolved on its own, as was noticed in [24]. In this paper,
we study this situation for generic dimensions and analytically show that complex saddles
corresponding to naked-singular geometries become irrelevant in the path-integral and hence
don’t contribute.

In the next subsequent section, we analyse the partition function stated in eq. using
Picard-Lefschetz methods for the case of 8 > Bmax-

1. Complex saddles and their relevance for B > Bmax

After defining the starting integration contour D € [0, 00) and determining all the saddles
(Zo) of eq. (LI), we proceed to find the relevant saddles which contribute to the integral
utilizing the Picard-Lefschetz method. According to this method, we analytically continue
the real r, to a complex variable r, = rf +ir{. When r, is complex, the exponent
T(r.) becomes a holomorphic function of r, with real (h) and imaginary (#) part: Z(r4) =
h(r+) + tH (r+). The direction of steepest descent/ascent (7,/K,) in the complex r+, plane
are given by the equation

Ort Oh(r?, v4 Or’. Ob(r*, 4
+> 5( a a) and a b( 1 +) (20)
Or Ore. Or or’.
where is the real parameter along the curve. — sign corresponds to the steepest descent

and + sign corresponds to the steepest ascent. Along these curves H remains constant. i.e.,
dH/d\ = 0. At the saddles, one satisfies Or§./OA = Or /OX = 0. Note that as Z(r+) is
purely real when r, is real, the Morse function satisfies h(r4.,—r4.) = 6(r{,7r'L) and hence
the flowlines are invariant under (74,74) — (r4.,7r4). In the complex r-plane, the flowlines
are symmetric around the real axis (ri = 0), see appendix |B] for more details. The real
integration contour (D) can be deformed to a new contour (C), which is the summation of
steepest contours (7)

C= > NgJo, No = Int(D,K,), (21)

o€saddle

where Int(, ) determines the intersection between two curves. n, can take values 0, +1. The
sign depends upon the orientation of the thimbles. n, = 0 will imply the saddle is irrelevant
and doesn’t contribute to the integral. Any non-zero value of n, will imply the saddle is
relevant and hence contribute to the integral.

Hence, in order to determine the n, for complex saddles (r=), one needs to see if the
steepest ascent flow-lines from these saddles intersect the real integration contour (D). To

9
find it, we note that to start with, Z(r;) is purely real along the integration contour, and
hence, (Z(r4))* = Z(r}.), where (.)* is complex conjugation. A necessary condition (not
sufficient) for the thimbles (,) from these complex saddles to intersect the real axis is that
H(rt) = 0. It is simply because, on the real axis H = 0 and H is conserved along the
flow-lines. The expression of H(rz) can be read out from eq. and it is given by,

w 2(d — (d-1)/2 _
Hrd) =4+55 (=) {sin(a 1)u) a sin((d 2a), (22)

where, u = arctan(/82/2,,, — 1). To see if H(r=) = 0 directly from eq. is not possible

analytically for arbitrary 6 > Bmax and d. However, in the regime of 8 >> Bmax, we can write

H(rz)

B>Bmax AGd d d—2 Bates 23)

dcos () +0 (2=)}

which can never vanish for arbitrary dimensions. It is easy to convince oneself that the
same will hold for an arbitrary 8 > Bmax, by observing that the integral along the real axis
is absolutely convergent, and hence the steepest ascent flow-line of any saddle not lying on
the real line can never intersect the real line. Hence, n, for complex saddles is always zero
making such complex saddles irrelevant in the computation of partition function. Hence, the
partition function receives contributions only from the thermal-AdS for 6 > Bmax thereby
giving

Z(B > Bmax) ~ exp [Z(r+)] = Le (24)
thermal—AdS thermal—AdS

This result reveals two important facts: one recovers the AdS-CFT conjecture and the
standard thermodynamic perspective, according to which thermal ads should only contribute
to the partition function. Secondly, since the complex saddles are naked singularities and
don’t contribute to the partition function for any value of 8 > Bmax, despite being dominant
saddles for certain regimes of (, this shows that the results are compatible with the cosmic
censorship hypothesis, which states that naked singularities are unphysical. Indeed, Picard-
Lefschetz cleanly discards these complex saddles even though they are solutions of Einstein’s
equation and are even dominant saddles for certain regimes of (.

B. Z(B) for B< Bmax

In the high temperature regime (when 3 < Bmax), all the saddles are purely real as can
be seen from eq. (15), consequently @ is also real. This gives

— »thermal—AdS = +
O0=r, <7 SP. (25)

This implies that the action Z(r;) at various saddles is also real as can be noticed from eq.
(18). As range of 6 is 0 < 6 < Bmax, this implies that 0 < @ < oo (6 > o correspond
to 8B — 0. From eq. it can be immediately inferred that we have Z(r,) < 0. The
action at saddle rt is always greater than the action at saddle ry: Z(ry) < Z(rt). Z(rf)

10
changes sign depending on 8 and dimensions. If tanh@ < 1/(d— 1), then Z(rf{) < 0;
and for tanh@ > 1/(d— 1) one has Z(r{) > 0. In the language of 8 this means that for
B < 2ln/(d—1), we have Z(r{) < 0, while for 8 > 2lm/(d— 1) the action Z(rft) > 0. This
is the Hawking-Page transition [42]. Summarizing it, we have

L(rz)<0 VO<B< Bmax

L(rt)<0 V0<B<

2l
Dep >0 VI EBS Bina: (26)

For these saddles, the action Z(r;) being always real implies that their imaginary part triv-
ially vanishes. This means that the steepest ascent emanating from them always intersects
our original integration contour D, which lies in the range 0 < rz < oo. If we now look at
the imaginary part of Im(Z(rq)), which we define as H, we notice that H = 0 for all the
saddles, the saddles lie on a Stokes ray. In such situations where the steepest ascent thimble
of a saddle intersects the steepest descent thimble of another saddle, the Picard-Lefschetz
method breaks down. To find out n, unambiguously and hence the relevance of saddles, one
needs to resolve such degeneracy. As the Stokes ray lies on the real axis (r. = 0), which
is the axis of symmetry of the flowlines, to resolve the Stokes ray, one needs to break the
symmetry; see Appendix |B] for more details. There are various ways one can break the sym-
metry, for example, by complexifying £, as in [43]. It can also be achieved by complexifying
Newton’s constant (G = |Gle",|e| < 1)PI] 24]. Choosing either sign of ¢, we find tha
all three saddles are relevant by the Picard-Lefschetz, see fig. (3). We also note that such
complexification of parameters often modifies the asymptotic convergence, and it could be
a threat to the convergence of the integral in general minisuperspace (as seen in [21] [44]).
However, in the present case, as long as || < 1, the integral in eq. remains convergen'
and well-defined.

Although the contributing saddles are the same, as one tunes € from 0* to 07, one
observes a homological jump in the thimbles/intersection numbers [4447], and as a result,
the deformed integration contours are different for € > 0 and € < 0, see fig. [3] The resultan
homological jump can be expressed as

I> K+ 45, ni re + D> ming, (27
i#i i#i

where i refers to the saddles participating in the Stokes jump. o;; and 7; are identically zero
whenever there is no Stokes jump. Also, oj = ii = 0, and they are elements of nilpotent
matrices. Whenever Stokes jump happens, smoothness across the jump requires

oj + yi + SO miFmj =0, ViFj. (28)

To be concrete, let’s consider the example of the AdS Schwarzschild black hole. In this case,
we observed Stokes ray among thermal a.d.s, small black hole (s.b.h) and large black hole
(.b.h) saddles when 8 < Bmax. To proceed, let us fix the orientation of the thimbles: we take
the orientation to be positive (+1) from left to right for 7(a.d.s) and 7(Lb.h). And from
down to up for J(s.b.h). For the reverse orientation, we assign (—1). With this convention,

Steepest ascent from all the saddles intersect the real line (for either sign) and hence contribute to
the partition function. Note that due to the degeneracy of the ads saddle in AdS¢, there are three
descent /ascent lines emanating from the saddle. However, only the branch lying on the positive
axis participates in the Stokes jump.

J(s.b.h) |} >| 010 J(s.b.h) fore7 +e. (29)
T(L.b.h) 011) \ zapn)

The matrix in the above equation encodes all the elementary jumps of each thimble. The
jump in eq. (29) is also expected by realizing that Morse function §(s.b.h) is always sub-
dominant that §(a.d.s) and (1.b.h). However, the dominance between h(a.d.s) and (1.b.h)
changes at Hawking-Page transition. Since the integral over 7(s.b.h) is exponentially smaller
than both J(a.d.s), and J(1.b.h), the thimble 7(s.b-h) can’t jump multiple of 7(a.d.s), and
J(Lb.h). Also, the jump matrix remains unchanged across the transition. Comparing the
transformation in eq. with eq. (7, we get the jump matrix for the thimbles (7,)

010
[oly =| 900), [o7his = (Ole. (30)
010

Clearly, the jump matrix is a nilpotent matrix of order 2.

To ensure the smoothness across the jump, ie., to ensure n,(a.d.s) 7(a.d.s) + n,(s.b.h)
J(s-b.h) + n,(Lb.h)7(1-b-h) to be continuous across the jump, one requires the condition
eq. (28) to hold. From it, one can compute the jump matrix for the intersection numbers

12
(nz), which reads
000
(Mis =| —L 0-1], [els = Oli. (31)
00 0
Similarly, the jump matrix (7) is also a nilpotent matrix of order 2. With the 7 matrix
as given in eq. (31), we conclude that n, corresponds to the a.d.s and 1.b.h saddles don’t
change. Only the n, corresponds to the s.b.h changes to account for all the changes in J
across the Stokes ray. Explicitly, one obtains

n,(a.d.s) > ng(a.d.s),  ng(1-b-h) > n,(1-b-h),

2
no(s.b.h) + —n,(a.d.s) — n,(1-b-h) + n,(s.b.h). (a2)

With the given orientation of the thimbles, the real line R € (—oo, +00) can be deformed
in two homologically different ways for « > 0 and € < 0, as (in d = 4),

R=/J(a.d.s) — J(s.b.h)+ J(Lb.h) fore >0

=J(a.d.s) + J(s.b.h) + Z(Lb.h) for e <0. (88)

Remembering that the integration contour was initially defined from 0 to oo, one should
put $7(a.d.s) in eq. to account only half of the thimble, [24] [25]. For d > 4, we
encounter a degeneracy of order (d — 3) for the thermal a.d.s saddle. The presence of
degeneracy for a.d.s saddle wouldn’t spoil the above analysis, but demands additional care.
The appearance of degeneracy implies the existence of multiple steepest-descent thimbles
(J(a.d.s)) emanating from the saddle (precisely (d — 2) directions, as explained below in
sec. [ITB 1). Only the part of the thimble lying on the positive-real axis participates in the
Stokes jump, and the other thimbles show no qualitative change (see fig. [3). However, eq.
is still applicable, as the contribution from the extra thimbles automatically drops out
while moving along the flowline. Hence, one can use the same argument and take wi (a.d.s).
Since n, is computed using Int(D,K,) and n, remains unaffected for a.d.s and |.b.h saddles
in the homology jump, ,’s corresponding to these saddles don’t change. Now, since the
integration over each of the thimbles 7’s are convergent, in the saddle point approximation,
one can compute the partition function eq. (4) in the high temperature limit,

1
Z(B < Bmax) = 5 / dry — / dry +/ ar,| exp(Z(r4)) fore >0

2 J (a.d.s) J(s-b.h) J (Lb.h)

From eq. (34), we note that the partition function is different for « > 0 and e < 0 due to
the sign difference in the second term and also not real. However, in the limit of vanishing
€ (Real G), one gets the real answer from either side. These can be done systematically by
taking the “homology average” of these two contours. By taking such averaging, one drops
the contribution from the subdominant saddle [24], and one gets

When 8 = Bmax, one encounters Stokes ray between thermal ads (r; = 0) and the

in the thimbles, see fig (4). Having obtained the intersection numbers(n,), the partition
function can be computed in a straightforward way by going to the cubic order (see, [17 for
a related scenario).

As one crosses 3 = Bmax, one also observes the homological jump in the Lefschetz thimbles
structure as the nature of saddles changes. Such situations are often referred to as singu-
larities, and the Stokes ray always passes through them. To see how the thimble structure

changes as we move through the singularity, we define a new variable ¢ = 1 — Z —., following

for orientations of thimbles for e < 0 and ¢ > 0, respectively.

1. Direction of steepest descent near saddles

In this section, we will briefly analyse the direction of steepest descent curves (7), which
gives information about local minima near the saddle. To find the direction of descent near

14
the saddles, we expand Z(r,) around the saddles (r§.) as

s OL OL
T(r4) -—L(rs) = tO

a) are a (38)

To ensure there is a minimum along the real and positive r; axis, one requires the first
non-vanishing term in the r-h.s. in eq. (88) to be negative definite. For the real black hole
saddles (Euclidean instanton) analyzing the second derivative of Z, we get

PT (d-VoPr saa], 2 B

Hence, at the large black hole (rf), it is negative, while at the small black hole (rz), it is
positive. Such behaviour is expected as a small black hole is known to be thermodynamically
unstable, whereas a large black hole is stable. Since these are real saddles, the direction of
minima is along the real axis only. While a small black hole is unstable along the real axis,
it admits a direction of steepest descent when analytically continuing r; to the complex
plane, see fig (3). At 8 = Bmax, one encounters degeneracy as the right-hand side in eq.

where, — sign signifies the presence of steepest descent along the real-positive r, direction.
Interestingly, there are also two different steepest descent directions in the complex r;-plane,

Now consider the case of the thermal AdS saddle at r, = 0 of degeneracy d—3. Presence
of degeneracy implies

(41)

For d = 4, the saddle is non-degenerate, while for higher d, degeneracy appears. In the
presence of degeneracy, the saddle point approximation breaks down, and one needs to go
into higher orders. The partition function when evaluated at r, = 0 saddle gives

Since the integral is convergent along the real r, axis, there is a steepest descent along this
direction. When d > 4, there are other curves (apart from the real r; line) in the complex
r+ plane along which the integral also converges. To see this we write r, = |r,|e’”, near the
saddle convergence remains unaffected if cos(y(d—2)) = 1. When d = 4, there are only two
directions (y = +7, along the real line) along which the integral converges. However, for
d =5 the directions (near the saddle) along which the integral converges are yp = 0,+27/3,

15
see fig. (3). Similarly, for higher d, there will be multiple paths in the complex r+ plane
along which the integral converges absolutely apart from the real (y = 0) contour, precisely
a total of (d— 2) J,’s. Explicitly, the directions emanating from the saddle at r = 0 are

2mm

n=0,1,2,--- ,(d—3). (43)

C. Thermodynamic phase-transition and instability

Discontinuous changes to the orientation of Lefschetz thimbles/intersection number are
related to the phase transition and thermodynamic instability of the black holes. To justify
the statement, let us examine the behaviour of specific heat (C), which is given by

Utilizing the expression for entropy S given by eq. and the temperature given by the
regularity condition of black hole T(r) = f’(r+)/(47), the specific heat for the black holes
with regular horizon r+ is given by:

(d= tr! T(r)

w
C(r4) = IG Tr) (45)
The specific heat at the black hole saddles is
d—1)Binax(r)4-2

AG 4/(Bmax)? — B?

At high temperatures (8 < Bmax), the specific heat C', of small black holes (r{) is neg-
ative, while for large black holes (rt) it is positive. This indicates the large black hole is
thermodynamically stable, while the small black hole is unstable. We also observed that
the thimbles (K(s.b.h)) emanating from a small black hole exhibit a jump in orientation
across the Stokes ray, resulting in a discontinuous change in the intersection number (n,).
This turns out to be true for the charged case as well, where a negative specific heat saddle
corresponds to a jump in ng, (see sec. and [IIIB 4). As a consequence, their contri-
bution to the partition function drops out upon homology averaging. At low temperatures
(8 > Bmax), C becomes complex, signifying the solutions describing complex black holes or
naked singular geometries. A slightly related conclusion is also mentioned earlier in [22].

Let us also point out that the specific heat diverges (dictating continuous phase transi-
tion) when T’(r) = 0, which happens when the saddles coalesce at 6 = Bmax. As discussed
earlier, when one crosses this point, the orientation of the Lefschetz thimbles (7) changes
discontinuously, see eq. (37). Hence, we observe that any discontinuous jump in the orien-
tation of thimbles is associated with unphysical behaviour of specific heat.

Ill. CHARGED ADS SCHWARZSCHILD BLACK HOLE

partition function in some cases gets eventually discarded in the Picard-Lefschetz analysis of
path-integral and small size sub-dominant blackhole geometries despite being relevant drops
out from the path-integral due to homology-averaging.

These geometries, which correspond to black hole solutions, consist of inner and outer hori-
zons at r_ and r,, respectively. These can be found using f(r) = 0, smaller positive real

geometries in the path integral, one requires
d

to be satisfied by a real positive r;. The inequality in eq. also ensures the positivity
of 8 at the horizon, see fig (6). We point out that violating eq. [52] will immediately give
a naked singular geometry; however, satisfying it doesn’t guarantee the absence of a naked
singularity. For instance, a negative saddle or a generic complex saddle can satisfy the
condition (62). However, they all correspond to a naked singularity, which is in conflict with
the cosmic censorship. We will address this issue more systematically by investigating such
naked singular geometries that appear as dominant saddle geometries of the gravitational
path integral in the semiclassical limit. We analyze the partition function for the charged
case in two different settings. The first corresponds to fixing the inverse temperature § and
the electrostatic potential ® at spatial infinity, known as the grand canonical ensemble. The
other case is where a fixed charge of the spacetime and asymptotically fixes the temperature,
known as the canonical ensemble.

A. Fixed Potential - Grand Canonical Ensemble

When fixing the Potential (®) at infinity, the grand partition function is given by:

where ga (a P 5

18
Similar to the AdS-Schwarzschild case, it will be convenient to switch from (S,@Q) to the
(r4,q) variables and perform the saddle-point analysis. Ignoring the Jacobian, we get

2(8,®) = [ dr.dg exp (Zonas) (55)

where, the region of integration (D) spans 0 < ry < 00 and —00 <q < +o with ry =q=0
point included and the action is given by

Tonas = <= [arr — (a—1)8 (rt? 4 4 © — aga 56

CAS = TEG TY (d-1)6 [ro pT Yq . (56)
In region D, the integrand has no essential singularity. To start with, we allow all possible
charges and take the integration contour for q to run from —oo to +00, as there is no
classical instability present (unlike the rotating solutions [48]). However, as we explain
below at saddles, g and r, get constrained and satisfy eq. (52). The integral in eq. isa
two-dimensional integral. However, since the argument inside the exponent is quadratic in q¢
(and hence, there is only one saddle for it), one can first perform the integration over q¢ and
retain the leading order term in G, reducing to an effective one-dimensional integral, which
is appropriate to do for our analysis in the semi-classical limit. The effective one-dimensional
integral for r; is then given by:

00 d-1 ;

Note that after performing the integration over q, the partition function eq. (57) admits
® — —® symmetry. As expected when ® = 0, eq. (57) reduces to eq. (Ei). We now
proceed with the Picard—Lefschetz analysis, which follows in the same manner as in the AdS
Schwarzschild case. The dominant contribution to the charged partition function is given
by saddle points, which are computed using the following equation:

with a two more saddles denoted rj. and rt. These saddles have the following expression

with associated charge qt = (rt). This can be obtained from the regularity condition

These saddles in eq. (62) share the same structure as the saddles for the AdS Schwarzschild
case, given in eq. (15) with the only exception that 6°,, can become imaginary depending
on ®. These saddles are regular for all 6 and &. The Kretschmann scalar for these saddle

geometries can be computed as before (see appendix [A, and it is given by

where we define

up for all saddle geometries. If @ becomes complex, which happens for real 8%, (© < ®max)

with 6 > 6%,,, the saddles r{ become complex. These saddles lack horizon exposing the
singularity at r = 0. These correspond to naked-singular geometries. Real solutions for r+

Similar to the AdS Schwarzschild case, the spacetime geometries at the charged saddle points

rt are regular, ie. 6 = 47/f'(r+) is satisfied, implying there is no conical singularity at the

horizon. When rE is a positive saddle, utilizing g = (rt), one satisfies the condition
for the no-naked singularity given in eq. (52).

Similar to the AdS—Schwarzschild case, one encounters a similar puzzle in the grand
canonical ensemble as the complex saddles dominate at extremely low temperatures, 6 >>
Be sss for ® < ®yax. The analysis proceeds analogously to the Schwarzschild case, with Bnax
replaced by 6°... Furthermore, for the grand canonical case, in the regime ® > ®yax, there
exists a negative saddle. At extreme low temperatures 3 — oo, it remains subdominant with
respect to the positive black hole saddle. However, its dominance relative to the thermal
AdS varies with the dimension: the negative saddle dominates over the thermal AdS in even
d, while in odd d, the thermal AdS phase remains dominant. Similar to earlier case, we
now proceed to analyze these saddle points to determine their contributions to the partition
function across different parameter regimes of § and ®, as summarized in the table. (I),
utilizing Picard-Lefschetz (PL) methods.

1. Complex saddles - 8 > B®... and ® < ®max

When © < ®yax and 2 > 6%... (low temperature), we obtain thermal-AdS along with two
complex saddles, similar to the AdS-Schwarzschild case. In a similar argument discussed in

21
sec. these complex saddles, although sometimes dominant, do not contribute to the
partition function, according to the PL method, see fig [I] It can be quickly understood as
follows: in the low-temperature regime, the complex saddle points yield a nonzero value of
H(rx, *) and fails to satisfy the relevance condition H(r¢, 6*) = 0 in any dimension d > 3.
Only the thermal saddle contributes as it lies on the integration contour. This implies that
the complex saddles corresponding to naked-singular geometries, despite being dominant,
fail to become “relevant” saddles as the deformed integration contour, according to the PL
method, doesn’t pass through them.

and B > Be ax: For illustration, we choose the parameters as: | = 1,® = ®yax/2, 6 = 10 — and
G = 1 with ®p,x. = V3/ 2 and Bo x = (2/30 . The steepest ascent associated with the Empty
AdS saddle (square box) intersects the original integration contour, making it relevant, while the
steepest ascent (red dotted curve) corresponding to complex saddle/naked singularities (blue dots)

doesn’t intersect, thereby irrelevant to the partition function.

2. Negative real saddle - ® > ®nax

When ® > ®nax, at any temperature, we have thermal AdS, a real positive (r{) and
a negative saddle (rj). The positive saddle corresponds to a black hole with a horizon.
However, the negative saddle corresponds to a naked singularity. Since all the saddles lie on
the real axis, we have H(r%_) = 0 for each of them and hence saddles lie on a Stokes ray. In a
way similar to the AdS-Schwarzschild case, we complexify the Newton constant (G = |Gle*)
and perform the PL analysis (see fig. [9). In the regime ® > ®max, we find that both the

22
thermal-AdS saddle and the positive black hole saddle are relevant for either sign of €, while
the negative saddle doesn’t contribute since the associated steepest ascent doesn’t intersect
the original integration contour. Hence, we reach the same conclusion that naked singular
geometries do not contribute to the partition function.

3. Positive real saddles - 8 < B®

max

and ® < ®nax

For ® < ®yax, at high temperatures (3 < Bmax), one obtains two real black hole saddles
along with the thermal AdS. Since H = 0 for all the saddles, the saddles lie on a Stokes
ray. By complexifying G, one can lift the Stokes ray and perform the PL analysis, as shown
in fig. The analysis is similar to the AdS-Schwarzschild case with 8 < Bmax; therefore,
we don’t repeat it. In a similar way, the contribution from the small black hole drops out
from the partition function after homology averaging. Only thermal-AdS and large black-
hole contribute. When 8 = 6%.,,, the black hole saddles coalesce into a single degenerate
saddle at rf = ry = 27l?/(d6®.,..). For such situation PL analysis is similar to the AdS-
Schwarzschild case with 8 = Bmax, see fig.

4. Extremal case - ® = Omax

For the extremal case, one finds the saddle solutions are the thermal AdS saddle (now
with the degeneracy factor of d— 2, as one of the black hole saddles coincides with thermal
ads) and a black hole saddle with horizon at ry = 47l?/(d8) which exists for all temperatures
(0 < 8 < co). Since saddles are real, they lie on the Stokes ray, and as before, one can
complexify G and proceed with PL analysis (see fig. [10).

5. Thermodynamic instability and homology jump

Similar to the AdS Schwarzschild, we examine the specific heat (Ce) of a charged black-
hole at constant potential (®) and susceptibility (yg) and analyze how the unphysical
behaviour of them is related to the discontinuous change in the orientation of the thim-
bles/intersection number. The specific heat of the black hole at constant potential (®) is

small black hole is unstable. At low temperatures 6 > B®, and ® < ®yax, Co becomes
complex, signifying that the corresponding solutions describe complex black holes or naked
singular geometries, which are unphysical. This scenario has been demonstrated in the fig.
(11@)p. The specific heat (Cs) diverges, when 8 = 8%... For the small black hole branch,
it diverges to —oo while for the large black hole branch, it diverges to +00. As discussed
earlier, as one crosses the critical point 8 = 6%,,, the orientation of the Lefschetz thimbles
changes discontinuously.

Similar to the AdS-Schwarzchild, charged small black holes are always subdominant than
ads and the large black hole, and hence always suffer from the Stokes jump. The Lefschetz
thimbles associated with small black holes undergo a homology jump across the Stokes ray.

24
Hence, upon taking the homology average, their contribution is eliminated from the parti-
tion function. Similarly, in the regime ® > ®,,,x, the specific heat Co associated with the
positive black hole saddle remains positive, indicating thermodynamic stability. In contrast,
the negative black hole saddle exhibits a negative specific heat for odd d and a positive
specific heat for even d. When d is odd, the negative saddle is subdominant to both the ads
and the positive saddle and hence shows a similar homology jump in the Lefschetz thimbles.
As discussed earlier, the negative saddle corresponds to a naked singular geometry and,
according to the Picard—Lefschetz technique, does not contribute to the partition function.

FIG. 11. This figure shows the behavior of specific heat capacity and susceptibility AdS; black
holes for ® < ®max in the case of grand canonical ensemble at various temperatures. For illustration
we choose 1 = 1,G = 1 and 6 = 0.96). with ®nax = V3/2.

Let us now briefly examine the behaviour of another thermodynamic quantity- suscepti-
bility. The susceptibility is given by:

0Q
=|. 69
v9 = 58, (69)
The susceptibility at the saddle points is given by:
w(d — 2)r4-3 d(d — 3) Br? + (2d — 5)rPr,. + BI? (d — 2)?
xa(r+) 4nG dpr, — 2nl2 (70)

It is easy to see from the above equation for d > 3, at high temperatures, the susceptibility
for the small black hole ry < 27/?/(d@) is negative, while large black holes r= > 27l?/(d8)
is positive. This indicates again that the small black hole is thermodynamically unstable,
while the large black hole is stable. The susceptibility diverges when both black holes
coalesce to one with horizon radius r+ = 27l?/d8, which corresponds to 2 = 8%, where Co

also diverges. This situation is illustrated in the figure |11(b)| While at low temperatures,

25
the susceptibility at the complex saddle solution is complex. However, the susceptibility of
negative solution alter sign as we go through different dimensions. To see this explicitly,
utilizing the saddle equation for negative saddle r, = —|r,|, one can recast the xg in eq.

as:

qu(d — 2)|r,|03 dblr4?? + 2a? |r| + BYP (d — 2)?6?
4nG B|r4| + 2rl? ,

xa(r+) = (-1) (71)

which manifestly shows the susceptibility of negative saddle is negative when d is odd and
positive for d even, similar to the behavior of specific heat.

B. Fixed charge: Canonical ensemble

We now focus on the situation where we fix the charge of the black hole instead of the
electrostatic potential at infinity, a.k.a the canonical ensemble. For the fixed charge case,
the partition function is given by

Z(8,q) = | ” aS exp(S — BE), (72)

an

where S(r,) and E(r;,q) are entropy and energy of the charge spacetime, given by the
relations in eq. (54) respectively. In terms of r; variable (ignoring Jacobian), we get

2(8,4) = f drs exp(Tenas(rs)): (73)

The integration contour D runs along 0* < r, < oo, that excludes the r; = 0 point, as it
corresponds to the essential singularity of the exponent when g 4 0, which also denotes a
physical consequence that empty AdS (r, = 0) is no longer a solution of Einstein’s equation
in the presence of non-zero charge. The exponent for the canonical ensemble is given by

> Ww d-1 d—2 re ¢
+

The dominant saddle configurations that extremizes the exponent Toaas(r+) of the integral
in eq.(73) are given by the saddle equation:

d pod-2 dn p2d-3
(d—2)12 * (d—2)8 *

pet? = 0, (75)

It is worth pointing out that in an arbitrary dimension d, any positive solution to the above
equation corresponds to a regular, no-naked singular black hole. Since, at these positive
saddles, the regularity condition 6 = 47/f’(r,), indeed the saddle point equation itself and
the no-naked singularity condition

are satisfied. While, a negative saddle r; = —|r;|, although satisfies regularity condition, it
corresponds to a naked geometry, as

the no-naked singularity condition is violated, and the same goes for the complex saddle
points. Computing the analytic expressions of saddles in an arbitrary dimension d is im-
possible as eq. becomes a higher-order polynomial. In the following, we focus on the
d = 3 (AdS,) case, and d = 4,5 in the extremely low temperature limit 6 —> 00, where some
analytic traceability is possible. Furthermore, we employed the Picard-Lefschetz technique
to determine the relevance of saddle points.

1. AdS4

We now proceed to analyze the canonical ensemble for Ad, for which the saddle point
equation reads as
36r4. —4nPrh + BP ry — BPP =0. (78)

The above equation is quartic in nature and can be solved explicitly to determine the saddle
points. However, significant insight about the nature of the saddles and their relevance can
be obtained by simply analyzing the discriminant without explicitly computing the saddles.
For convenience, let us introduce two variables, namely:

I 3
fe=Z and Be= ve (79)

which correspond to the critical point satisfying the conditions 08/0r, = 0°6/0r?, = 0. We
rescale the charge and inverse temperature parameters as q = aq, and 8 = b f,, respectively.
The discriminant of the saddle eq. in these parameters is given by:

A(a,b) = —Ca?b?q2?B8 [b*(a? + 3)? — 8b?(3a? + 1) + 16a , (80)

where C is a positive real number. In the following, we analyze the nature of the roots for
different parameter regimes of a and 8, see fig.

For |a| > 1, the discriminant remains negative for all values of b 4 1, (see figure [12),
indicating the presence of one positive real saddle point, one negative real saddle point, and a
pair of complex conjugate saddles. According to the Picard—Lefschetz method, the complex
conjugate pair of saddles—corresponding to naked singular geometries— are irrelevant and
do not contribute to the path integral, as they fail to satisfy the necessary condition, H(r4.) =
0.The negative real saddle (also naked singularity)— and the positive saddle, both satisfy
the necessary condition, H(r§.) = 0. However, for this regime it doesnot lead to any stokes
degeneracy (see figure[I3) [13) for 0 < b < 1, but does for 1 < b. Similar to the earlier cases, we lift
the stokes degeneracy by com lexifying the Newton constant. After complexification lifting
the degeneracy and noticing that the negative saddle lies outside the defining contour, as a
consequence its dual/steepest ascent to the thimble does not intersect the original integration
contour, it is also irrelevant and does not contribute to the path integral. Meanwhile, the
positive real saddle satisfies the necessary condition and lies on the defining contour, making
it a relevant saddle according to the Picard—Lefschetz prescription. Therefore, for |a| > 1 at

all temperatures the partition function gets contribution from only the regular and no-naked
singular geometry. This situation is being illustrated in the figures and (14).

For |a| < 1, the discriminant can be positive or negative depending on b (see fig [12).
Particularly, one notices that when 0 < b < b_ or b > bz, the discriminant remains negative,
leading to the same conclusion as in the |a| > 1 case. The quantities b, are the roots of the
discriminant A, given by

with the associated temperatures defined as: 6. = b4(.. Here, 0 < b_ < 1 and 2V/2/3 <
bz <1as0< |al| <1. At the critical point |a| = 1 and b = 1, or equivalently g = |gq.| and
3 = 6., where A vanishes, we have a positive triply degenerate saddle solution r,, given by

ro=l/v6, (82)

and one negative real solution rneg = —1/ (3V6). Applying PL analogous to the earlier case,
we obtain that the negative saddle is irrelevant as it lies outside defining contour. Whereas
the triply degenerate positive saddle satifies the necessary condition and lies on the defining
contour as shown in the figure (I6). Therefore, the triply degenerate positive black holes is
relevant and contribute to the path integral. Similarly, along the curves b = b; or b = b_ with
|a| < 1, the discriminant vanishes. However, in these cases, unlike the critical case, one finds
areal negative saddle, a real positive saddle, and a doubly degenerate positive saddle. All of

Newton constant G = e*. The parameters for this plot are as follows: a = 1/2,b = b_ = 0.6456.

Picard Lefschetz analysis for b = b_ is shown in the figure (15). For b_ < b < by, one can
convince themselves from the plot that A > 0, implying that the equation admits four real
saddle solutions—either one positive and three negative saddles, or three positive and one
negative saddle, depending on the value b takes. However, according to Descartes’ rule of
signs, which states that in a regime where all the roots are real, it can have only one negative
saddle and three positive saddles, one finds that the latter case occurs. Again we encounter
the Stokes degeneracy, which is resolved by complexifying the Newton constant. Let ry

TABLE III. Various ranges of the free parameters (q,3) and the corresponding nature of the
solutions in case of canonical ensemble.

To summarize, we find that in various regimes of (q, 3), as mentioned in table. [I] com-
plex/negative saddles describing naked singularity are always irrelevant by PL and don’t
contribute to the partition function. Only real and positive solution contribute to the par-
tition function.

In the limit 8 — oo the odd term me in the saddle equation given by can be
dropped, that excites for an analytic understanding about the saddle geometries of AdSs
and AdS¢ for arbitrary q. In this limit, the saddle equation reduces to

2 5 :

antr-¢ =0 and spre tm 7 =O. (85)
for d = 4 and d = 5 respectively. Defining a new variable x = ris these equations can be
made cubic and quartic in x given by:

ae +a?-q=0 and a! +223-(@=0. . (86)
for d= 4 and d= 5 respectively. Similar to the AdS4, we proceed with the same approach
of analyzing the discriminant of the above equation, which serves as a good candidate to
identify the nature of the saddle point solutions (The nature of the saddles for arbitrary
8 > 0 with various regimes of q is illustrated in Fig. (18)) for nature of saddle for given with
any value of 6 > 0) . For the quartic equation (the second equation in|86), the discriminant
A is found to be negative for any value of g. This implies that, in the extremely low
temperature limit, i.e., G + oo, AdS¢ has one real positive saddle, a real negative saddle
and the rest are complex conjugate pairs. Implementing the Picard Lefschetz technique, we
obtain that only the real positive saddle is relevant and contributes to the partition function.
However, unlike AdS¢ case, the sign of AdS; discriminant depends on the value of charge q.
To be precise, the discriminant of the cubic equation A (first equation in 86) is given by:

Axe (tt — 2707) /4. (87)

For @? < [?/27, the above discriminant is negative, while for g? > [?/27 it is positive and
vanishes for q? = 17/27. Irrespective of the discriminant sign, there always exists one real
positive saddle, one real negative saddle, and the rest are complex conjugate saddles. The
nature of Among these, only the real positive saddle is the relevant and contributing saddle
to the path integral. These situations are illustrated in the figure (19).

3. Homology averaging of Lefschetz Thimbles

Similar to the earlier case, in this section we discuss about the Stokes jump and homology
averaging for the canonical ensemble. We notice when one fixes the charge; for the range of
parameters |g| < gq. and G_ < 6 < 64, there are four saddles, specifically: one negative (rj )
and three positive solutions (r}. <r? < r3). Picard-Lefschetz analysis reveals the existence
of a Stokes line among these saddles. To break this Stokes degeneracy, we complexify
G = |Gle* which leads to the discontinuous jump in the thimbles for « > 0 and € < 0 as
shown in the figure (i). The homology jump in thimbles associated with the saddles can

33
be expressed as

(rh) > (02) for eT +e (88)
T (ri) T(rt)

Since the negative saddle rj is irrelevant and doesn’t contribute to the integral cycle, we
refrain to consider the lower 3 x 3 matrix in eq. which is exactly the same as mentioned
in eq. (29). Also note that J(r%.) remains unchanged across the jump, hence the analysis
will proceed same as in the case of high temperature AdS Schwarzschild case. Therefore,
the contour of integration D € (0*,0o) can be expressed homologically two different ways
as

=F (r!) +I (r2) + T(r?) fore <0. ()

It is important to note that there is no 1/2 factor in front of J(r4,) as we consider the

compared to the other saddles.

entire thimble associated with Ths This difference comes because of an essential singularity
at r; = 0 in the action when q 4 0 and the thimble ends there. As explained earlier, upon
doing the homology average, the contribution from the r?, saddle (sub-leading) drops out.
Furthermore, we find other stokes degeneracy situations: |g| <q. and 8 = 64 or B= (i,
where we observe the merging of saddle points. The homology analysis for this case, goes
exactly similar way as explained in Sec. (IIB). One finds the Lefschetz thimbles undergo a

34
discontinuous change in their thimble structure across the degenerate point. However, for
either choice of complex deformation angle we find all the positive black hole solutions are
relevant.

4. Thermodynamic stability analysis

Similar to earlier cases, we examine the specific heat at fixed charge to analyse the
thermodynamic stability of black holes. The specific heat at constant charge for the black
hole saddles reads as

Cyl 5 Ped.
a" IG d(d—l pr — In(Qd—3)Pr, + (d—2P-2B

(90)

Analogous to the grand canonical ensemble, the specific heat at fixed charge becomes com-
plex when r, is complex, corresponding to unphysical naked singular geometries. For real
positive black hole saddles, the sign of the denominator determines thermodynamic stabil-
ity: a positive denominator yields C, > 0, corresponding to a stable black hole, whereas
a negative denominator leads to Cy < 0, indicating instability. The C, diverges when the
denominator vanishes, which happens for the critical point |q| = q and 6 = (..

Meanwhile for real negative black hole saddles, r, = —|r,|, the specific heat at constant
charges becomes:

qu(d—1)r Plr,|4

G=(-V) 2G d(d— 1) B|r4|? + 2x(2d — 3)P|r4| + (d— 2)2778*

(91)

As we are interested in d > 3, it is evident from the above expression that the negative black
hole saddle exhibits a negative specific heat when d is odd and a positive specific heat when
d is even, analogous to the regime, ® > ®yax in the grand canonical. Particularly, for d = 3,
the expression for the specific heat reads as:

Qnd
wrt fre,

~ G 66r2 — 6rPr, + 2B"

Cy (92)
From the above discussion, it is clear that the specific heat associated with the negative real
saddle point, which appears in various regimes, is negative, whereas the specific heat of the
complex saddles is complex. Now, we proceed to examine the behaviour of specific at the
positive real saddle solutions in various ways by studying the sign of the denominator of C4.

Simply, by examining the nature of saddle solutions and with a little bit of algebra, one
may determine the sign of specific heat at the positive saddle solution. For |gq| > qc, at any
temperature except at the critical temperature and |g| < ge. with either 6 < 6_ or B > Bx,
one finds a positive real black hole that has positive specific heat, indicating thermodynamic
stability and is the sole relevant contributing saddle to the partition function. For |q| < qd
we have three positive black hole solutions with horizon radii rj, r?., and r3, satisfying
ri <r? <r, all of which are relevant. We notice that the specific heat of small rj, and large
rs, black holes have positive heat capacities, while medium black holes rj acquire a negative
specific heat, indicating thermodynamic instability [49] [50]. Nevertheless, the contribution of
r, to the partition function drops out upon performing the homology averaging, as explained
in sec. Hence, we reach the same conclusion as obtained before for AdS-Schwarzschild
and the charged black hole in the grand ensemble.

35
Along the curves 3 = 6_ or B = 8,, with |q| < qc, the specific heat at the non-degenerate
positive saddle is positive, whereas the specific heat diverges at the doubly degenerate saddle
point. Similarly, at the critical case |q| < q and 8 = (, at the triply degenerate positive
saddle C;, diverges. At these points where saddles merge/specific heat diverges, the structure
of Lefschetz thimbles changes discontinuously.

IV. KSW ALLOWABILITY OF COMPLEX BLACK HOLES

In this section, we study the KSW (Louko-Sorkin—Kontsevich-Segal-Witten) criterion
to the generic complex geometry/saddles for the asymptotically AdS spacetimes. We are
interested in seeing whether the this could assists in resolving the puzzle pointed in the
earlier part of the paper. The KSW is a diagnostic tool to identify “allowable” complex
spacetime metrics on which sensible QFTs can be defined [51}53]. While this seems like
a simple requirement, in practice, the KSW puts strong constraints on the metrics which
are physically “allowable” [82\ [54/56]. In the following, we examine the compatibility of
the complex saddles contributing to the partition function with the KSW criterion. The
line-element for the Charged - AdSq,, spacetime is given by:

2
ds* = a t+ f(r)\dr?t+r?dQa1, with rp <r<o, (93)
with f(r) given the relation (48). Let us consider a generic complex curve r(w) in complex
r plane which is monotonically increases along real axis, parameterized by a real parameter
u such that r(0) =r, and r(1) =o. In terms of the u— variable, the line element reads as:

r'(u)?
f(r(u))
Therefore, a charged AdS black hole with horizon radius r; is said to be KSW allowable if
the components of its line element satisfy F]

Since the above criterion is pointwise, it must be satisfied at every point along the contour
parameterized by u. In principle, to determine whether a given saddle is KSW allowable, one
should evaluate the extremal curve test as described in [21] [55]. However, carrying out such
an extremal curve test is technically challenging. Nevertheless, one can still obtain conclusive
information regarding the disallowable black hole geometries by employing the weak KSW
criterion, which corresponds to the non-radial part of the full KSW condition—namely, it
involves only the angular and temporal sectors of the metric while neglecting the radial
component. The weak KSW criterion is given by P}

Yweak(u) = larg(f(r(w))| + (d- 1) |arg(r(u)”)| <a forall we [0,1]. (96)

ds* = du? + f(r(u))dr? + r(u)*dQa1, withO<u<1. (94)

X(u) = + |arg(f(r(u))| + (d= 1) Jarg(r(u)?)| <7 for all. w € [0,1]. (95)

1 This condition remains valid as long as there is no Stokes degeneracy in the system. However, in the
presence of such degeneracy, one must complexify the Newton constant to lift it. As a consequence,
the KSW condition receives a modification that depends on the complex rotation angle 6 of the Newton
constant, leading to the modified criterion [21]: U(u) < m— 20. Nevertheless, for any choice of 6, the real

line is always allowed, hence the real/Euclidean saddles.
? As a consequence of the absolute value in the criterion, if a complex saddle r+ is allowed (or disallowed),

then its complex conjugate r4. is also allowed (or disallowed).

black holes (8 = Bmax/2), respectively, that weak KSW allowed. The purple dots are the weak
KSW allowed complex naked singular geometries at 3 slightly above Bmax, while blue dots represent
the KSW disallowed complex saddles (8 = 108max)-

Moreover, for a spacetime, it is necessary but not sufficient to satisfy the weak KSW for
it to be an allowable. As for any generic complex curve, since the boundary condition
is fixed, if a spacetime violates the weak KSW condition at u = 0 i.e r = rz, one may
therefore conclusively regard that geometry as disallowed. While the weak KSW condition
does not guarantee the allowability of a geometry, it does offer partial information about
geometries that are disallowed. Hence, a generic spacetime with a complex horizon r4 is
KSW disallowed if

Lweak(0) = (d — 1) jarg(r3)| > 7, (97)

that is,

Utlilizing the above condition, the KSW allowability scenario using weak condition is il-
lustrated for Schwarzschild case in figure (21), for grand canonical case in figure and
canonical case in figure (23). The region covered with red dots corresponds to the complex
geometries that violate the KSW criterion, while the region covered with green dots corre-
sponds to points that obey the weak KSW criterion. It is worth noting that the disallowed

Vv. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we explore the issues raised recently in the work [24] where the authors
focused their attention on analysing subtleties of the Euclidean gravitational AdS partition
function. They noticed that such partition function in the saddle-point approximation can
be reduced to one-dimensional integrals which can be analysed using complex analysis and
Picard-Lefschetz theory. An interesting puzzle that was seen was the occurrence of complex
saddles, which can become dominant in the partition function and are naively expected
to govern its behaviour. However, if that is the case, then this would be in tension with
AdS/CFT, which is a serious concern. The authors in [24] then used Picard-Lefschetz
methods to realize that such complex saddles which although become dominant in certain
cases and are in conflict with AdS/CFT, actually either become irrelevant or drop out from
path-integral under homology-averaging, thereby resolving the conflict.

In this paper, we explore these by considering the Euclidean path-integral for the case of
AdSq41-Schwarzschild and AdSq+1-charged spherically symmetries geometries. As Euclidean

38
gravitational path-integrals suffers from conformal factor problem, following the ideas pro-
posed in [22], Lorentzian gravitational path-integral is utilized to define a Euclidean one
via integral transform, which has been seen to reproduce the results of standard Euclidean-
gravitational path-integral at the saddle-points. The thermal partition function is then a
one-dimensional integral, which becomes our starting point. This one-dimensional integral
is then applied to AdSq4-Schwarzschild and AdS_+1-charged spherically symmetries geome-
tries, where it is analysed using Picard-Lefschetz methods.

We first consider the case of AdSg,1-Schwarzschild spherically symmetric geometries,
which follows from the Einstein’s equations. The thermal partition function Z(@) is com-
puted by utilizing the expression of Entropy and Energy of the geometric configuration as
a function of r;, which is the horizon’s radius. The one-dimensional integral mentioned
in eq. (7) over entropy reduces to one-dimensional integral over r; (modulo Jacobians).
This one-dimensional integral is studied in the saddle-point approximation. For the case of
AdSa41-Schwarzschild, there are three saddles: one appearing at r4 = 0 (with degree d— 3),
the other two follow from quadratic equation and are denoted by rt. The Kretschmann
scalar shows that all the saddle geometries associated with non-zero re are singular at
r = 0. It is seen that for all 6, the saddle with r; = 0 correspond to thermal-AdS. For
B > Bmax (low-temperature), the two saddles rt form a complex-conjugate pair and corre-
spond to naked-singular geometries. For 8 < Bmax (high-temperature), rt are real saddles
with r{ corresponding to larger black hole geometry and rj corresponding to smaller black
hole.

We then ask the question about the contribution of such geometries in the gravitational
partition function. A naive expectation would be that all saddles will contribute with the
dominance coming from those saddles with the hightest Re(Z(r+)). If this is the case then
one gets into conflict with AdS/CFT where it well known that thermal-AdS reproduces
results consistent with the dual CFT in the low temperature regime [40]. This puzzle
was tackled in a recent work for AdS; [24], where the authors realized that Picard-Lefschetz
methods when utilized in evaluating the one-dimensional integral stated in eq. (7). helps in
picking only the “relevant saddles”. For the case of AdSg41-Schwarzschild, complex saddles
corresponding to naked singular geometries which become dominant for certain values of
B > Bmax are irrelevant in the path-integral. Small sized black holes which are although
relevant but sub-dominating for 6 < Bmax drops out of the path-integral after homology
averaging. These sub-dominant small-sized black holes also have negative specific heat. It is
seen that methods of Picard-Lefschetz systematically picks the relevant saddles by deforming
the original integration contour to pass along the Lefschetz thimbles of the relevant saddles.

We also showed analytically that complex saddles corresponding to naked singularities
for AdSg41-Schwarzschild always are irrelevant. This is easy to prove as the Im(Z(r+))
is constant along the steepest ascent and descent contours. As Im(Z(r+)) at these sad-
dles is always non-zero, this implies that steepest ascent contours from these saddles will
never intersect the original integration contour lying along the positive real-line, where the
Im(Z(r4)) is zero. This analytically proves that naked-singularities which although are so-
lution to Einstein’s equation and can be dominating in path-integral for certain values of
B> Bmax, are not relevant saddles.

Small-sized black hole saddles for the case of AdSq1-Schwarzschild are always relevant,
as the Im(Z(r,)) = 0. However, making an unambiguous decision regarding their relevance
is not easy, as the flow lines from all the saddles overlap with each other. This is due to
a symmetry mentioned in eq. present in the system. Only after the symmetry is

39
broken and degeneracy is lifted, then a clarity regarding the relevance of saddle is achieved.
Complex deformations of Newton’s constant G = |Gle* is one way to lift the degeneracies,
a process first introduced in I]. Once the degeneracies are lifted, it is seen that steepest
ascent contours from the will always intersect the original integration contour. These small
BHs which have negative specific heat are shown to be always sub-dominating in the path-
integral. The process of lifting degeneracies via complex deformation of G' however show that
the orientation of thimbles in the complex plane changes depending on sign of €. Small-BHs
saddles undergo homology jumps as the sign of ¢€ flips. The contribution from these sub-
dominant saddles having negative specific heat drops out from path-integral in homology-
averaging.

We then studied the case of charged AdSa;; black holes probing the same issues inves-
tigated for AdSq,i-Schwarzschild BHs. We first focus on the grand canonical case. Here,
we observe that complex saddles and saddles with negative real ry correspond to naked
singularities. As before, they are dominating in regimes where ® < ®,,,, and 6 > Bmax
(regime of complex saddle), and for ® > ®ynax (regime of negative real saddle). This is the
low temperature regime. As before, if the path-integral is performed naively, by taking into
account the contribution from all saddles, then we will get into conflict with the AdS/CFT
results. However, when situation is analyzed using Picard-Lefschetz, then it is seen these
saddles don’t contribute in the partition function as they are either irrelevant (which is the
case for complex saddles), or they undergo homology jumps thereby dropping out under
homology averaging. For low temperature, the relevant saddles are either thermal-AdS or
large-BH, which are the only ones contributing to the partition function thereby resolving
the conflicts.

We then discuss the high-temperature phase for the charged-AdS in a similar way. Here
also we notice that in the various regimes of the parameters the saddles are real (there are no
complex saddles in this regime). These real saddles as before have Im(Z(r+)) = 0, thereby
implying the steepest ascent from them intersect the integration contour. However, as all
the saddles satisfy this criterion, there is overlapping of flow-lines making it impossible to
decide upon the relevance of each saddle unambiguously. Here again we need to employ
complex deformation of Newton’s constant G = |Gle’* in order to lift the degeneracy. All
the saddles are relevant once the degeneracy is resolved. Depending on the sign of €, the
thimbles structure in the complex plane undergo a homology jump in their pattern. The
sub-dominating saddle at ry having negative specific heat drops out of the partition function
on homology averaging despite being a relevant saddle.

Moving on to canonical ensemble for the charged-AdS, we notice a similar pattern. How-
ever, due to algebraic limitations, we could only do a study of AdS45,¢. In Ad, case
we analyse the low-temperature and high-temperature regime, but for AdS;,¢ only low-
temperature analysis was possible analytically, beside investigating the regimes based on
critical charge q. (see table for various regimes). Here again we realize that saddles cor-
responding to naked-singular geometries (which are either complex saddles or saddles with
r+ <0) don’t contribute in the partition function despite being either dominant saddles
in these regimes. They drop out either because they are irrelevant. For high temperature,
sub-dominant saddles are relevant. However, they drop out of the partition function under
homology averaging. Only thermal-AdS and/or saddles with positive specific heat contribute
to the partition function

In this paper we studied the Euclidean partition function for various AdS geometries in
arbitrary dimensions and noticed a pattern. Naked singular geometries (which correspond

40
to either complex saddles or saddles with negative r_) despite being solution to Einstein’s
equation and could be dominant saddles in certain regimes of parameter space, drop out of
the partition function. Based on Picard-Lefschetz analysis it is seen that they are irrelevant.
Sub-dominant saddles with positive r; come with negative specific heat. Although being
relevant in the Picard-Lefschetz analysis, they drop out under homology averaging thereby
not contributing to the partition function. Only thermal-AdS saddle and stable-BH are
relevant and contribute to the partition function for the cases investigated in this paper.
We also investigate how these saddles fare in light of the KSW allowability criterion. We
make use of a weaker version of KSW to study saddles allowability. It is seen that complex
saddles which correspond to naked singularities are always disallowed for large enough £3.
Meanwhile, for 8 slightly above B%,,, weak KSW allows these complex saddles. We believe
a more sophisticated version of KSW will make all such complex saddles corresponding to
naked singularity disallowed. Naked singularities corresponding to saddles with negative
real r, < 0 are KSW allowed. Sub-dominant small sized black holes with r, > 0 are
also KSW allowed, despite dropping out from the partition function. Thermal-AdS and
large-sized black holes are KSW allowed. We believe that this allowability of real saddles
corresponding to naked-singularity with negative r+ <0 and small-sized BHs with ry > 0
is an anomaly and suggesting that KSW criterion is an insufficient to rule out such “un-
physical” geometries. Such situations have been witnessed earlier [I], where it has been
noted that there are geometries which are un-physical but are allowed by KSW criterion.
Perhaps a upgraded version of KSW criterion is needed to rule-out such configurations.

Appendix B: Symmetry of flowlines and Stokes Overlap

In this appendix, we will briefly discuss the symmetry seen in the flowlines and its relation
to the Stokes overlap. We start by noting that Z(r;) is purely real whenever r is real. It
implies that when analytically continuing r; to a complex variable, it satisfies

(Z(r4))* =Z(r4). (Bl)

To see what eq. (B1) implies about the structure of flowlines in the complex r;-plane, we
go to the polar coordinate and write r, = Rexp(iO). Substituting it in eq. (BI) and noting
that Z(r_) = h(r+) + iH (r+), we get

h(R,-©) = 6(B, 0), H(R,-0) = —H(R,@). (B2)

To see how eq. (B2) constraints the flowlines in eq. in the complex r,-plane, we write
the steepest descent(—)/ascent (+) thimbles as

OR _ 06(R,9) and 00 ___ 1 Ob(R,9)

dA" OR O'R ae’
where A is a parameter along the flowline and explicitly, h(R,O) and H(R, 9) are given by
(considering AdS-Schwarzschild black hole)

9). Y pre sin S Ald =) sin O} 4 R sin{ dQ
H(R,O) = GR |B {(d— 1)0} i (: {(d—2)0} + Fs (a9})].

42
We use “modulus” in G to indicate that G is real. From the eqs. (B3) and (B4), it is
clearly evident that the flow lines are invariant under 0 — —O change, or equivalently

(r4.,r4) > (r{, —r) transformation

Js > Jo and K, 4 K,, for, O > -0. (B5)
The real axis (0 = 0) is the axis of symmetry along which

FI) 1 46(R, 0)
Plog = =F
HR, le0=0 S| = FR 56 |e,

=0 VRE (0,00). (B6)

Now if saddles lie on the real axis, then eq. immediately implies the existence of a
Stokes ray (provided h(R,© = 0) are different at these saddles, which will always be the
case if the saddles are non-degenerate). We encounter a similar situation when 6 < Bmax.
Hence, the Stokes ray lies along the real axis/ axis of symmetry transformation. A similar
study was also done in cosmology previously in [2]]. As discussed in sec. (TB), presence
of such Stokes degeneracy poses challenges in implementing the Picard-Lefschetz method,
and hence it becomes necessary to resolve them. Various resolutions were considered in
to lift such degeneracy; one of them is to rotate Newton’s constant by a small phase
G = |Gle,|el< P| With this, the Morse function modifies to

be =H +H. (B7)

Now, the modified steepest descent/ascent equation in the presence of the complexified
Newton’s constant becomes

aR a(R,P) , 00 1 06(R, 9)
Dr oR and dv 60” (B8)
which is clearly not invariant under 0 — —O, as
be(R, -©) = h(R, ) — H(R, ©) £H(R, ). (B9)
Hence we conclude
Ii> TF: amd Ki +Ks, for 05-0, (B10)

where the tilde over % and K, indicates that the thimbles are different after the transfor-
mation © — —O, unlike eq. (B5) and superscript ¢€ indicates the flow-lines are computed
with complexified G. Now suppose we have a Stokes ray between two saddles o and o’; then
we will have either J, = Ky or, J,. = K,. However, in the presence of a non-zero phase
(6),

IZ #KS or, me #-KS, (B11)

and hence, it will resolve the Stokes ray. To see it consider the particular flow equation, as

mentioned in eq. (B8)

3 Resolving Stokes degeneracy is also possible by complexifying 8, see [43]. When complexifying 8, saddles
change; however, complexifying Newton’s constant wouldn’t affect saddles. Complexifying 3 reminds us

of using quantum correction for lifting degeneracy, where saddles also receive modifications 21].

Evaluating at © = 0 (direction of Stokes ray), we get

G An 2
In the presence of non-zero €, ge is non-zero at O = 0, implying lifting the Stokes ray.

The quantity Plo-0 is interpreted as follows: as we move along the steepest descent /ascent
thimbles A changes monotonically, now if the change in © (evaluated at © = 0) is non-
zero, it will imply the thimble deviates and no longer lie along the real axis. Hence, it will
necessarily break the Stokes ray. Moreover, since the deviation is proportional to €; changing
e to —e€ amounts to changing the direction of © at O = 0.

Hence, lifting the Stokes ray (which lies along the real axis and hence, is invariant under
© — —O transformation) is intimately tied to the breaking of the 0 — —O symmetry of
the system, [21]. Also note that with the complexified G, one satisfies

b_(R,©) =6.(R,-@) and, H.(R,-0) = —H_.(R, 9), (B15)

where H(R,O) = H(R,O) — eh(R,O) is the phase. Eq. ensures that whenever we
add contours with « > 0 and € < 0 (homology averaging), one always gets a real answer. In
the limit e + 0, Eq. reduces to eq. Ore either side.

Let us also mention that complexifying 3 [43], even complexifying ?, one can resolve the
Stokes degeneracy, which also breaks © + —© symmetry. The above discussion extends
straightforwardly in the case of charged back holes for both grand canonical and canonical
ensemble where the Euclidean action is also real.
