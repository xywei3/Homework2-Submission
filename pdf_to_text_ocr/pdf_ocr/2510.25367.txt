Abstract

Disordered systems subject to a fluctuating environment can self-
organize into a complex history-dependent response, retaining a mem-
ory of the driving. In sheared amorphous solids, self-organization is
established by the emergence of a persistent system of mechanical in-
stabilities that can repeatedly be triggered by the driving, leading to a
state of high mechanical reversibility. As a result of self-organization,
the response of the system becomes correlated with the dynamics of its
environment, which can be viewed as a sensing mechanism of the sys-
tem’s environment. Such phenomena emerge across a wide variety of
soft matter systems, suggesting that they are generic and hence may de-
pend very little on the underlying specifics. We review self-organization
in driven amorphous solids, concluding with a discussion of what self-
organization in driven disordered systems can teach us about how sim-
ple organisms sense and adapt to their changing environments.

1. Introduction

The theme of this review addresses the following question: What can self-organization,
memory formation and learning in a driven disordered system teach us about how simple
organisms lacking a brain sense and adapt to their changing environment? Our aim is
to present a theoretical understanding of how self-organization and learning emerge in a
sheared amorphous solid. We then describe how such insights may guide us in understanding
how simple organisms, like bacteria, sense and adapt to changing environments. In this first
section we present the rich and complex response of driven disordered systems, and conclude
with a detailed outline of this review’s contents and its key points.

Understanding the response of a disordered solid to an externally imposed forcing, such
as stress or strain, is important in order to characterize the transitions between rigid and
flowing states in a wide variety of soft matter systems. Examples for such behavior include
the jamming transition in granular materials (1), the yielding transition in amorphous
solids (2, 3), the hysteretic response of crumpled thin elastic sheets (4) and the depinning
transition of a pinned elastic interface, such as flux-lines in type II superconductors (5).
The interplay between deformation energy cost and gain, as the disordered solid adapts to
the imposed forcing, gives rise to rich dynamics on a complex energy landscape, exhibiting
dependence on deformation history and self-organization.

Fig. 1(a) shows the athermal response of an amorphous solid to deformations by an
externally applied shear strain. When subject to monotonously increasing shear ¢, the

1 INTRODUCTION
amorphous solid responds by a stress © opposing the deformation, as seen in Fig. 1(b).
The response under increasing strain € is characterized by stress-strain segments in which
X builds up continuously. These segments correspond to purely elastic changes of particle
configurations and are punctuated by stress drops due to development of mechanical insta-
bilities. The latter are plastic events and lead to abrupt spatially localized rearrangements,
called shear transformation zones or soft-spots (6, 7, 8, 9). Fig. 1(c) illustrates the particle
displacements occurring during a typical plastic event. The region shaded in red shows a
shear transformation. The accompanying particle displacements (indicated by vectors) ex-
hibit a characteristic quadrupolar pattern and give rise to long-range elastic interactions via
redistribution of local stresses. Increasing ¢ further, © settles into a steady-state, fluctuating
around a value Ny, called the yield stress, which marks the onset of yielding.

Experiments on colloidal suspensions and simulations of amorphous solids show that
when subject to oscillatory shear strain at amplitude e7, these systems can settle into a
periodic response (10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15). Moreover under athermal conditions, numerical
simulations reveal that this response is microscopically periodic, meaning that the particles
return to their initial positions at the end of each period. Fig. 1(d) shows the typical be-
havior of the potential energy U during such a limit cycle. Again, the response is composed
of purely elastic deformations, described by the parabolic segments of the configurational
potential energy, which are interrupted by energy drops that accompany plastic events.
Experiments and simulations further show that as the amplitude of oscillatory shear er is

increased, the number of driving cycles needed to reach a cyclic response increases, the cyclic
response gets increasingly more complex, consisting of a larger number of plastic events,
and its period starts to span multiple driving cycles. Beyond a critical amplitude €., cyclic
response is not attainable anymore, marking the onset of the irreversibility transition (12).

The process of subjecting the amorphous solid to cyclic shear at strain amplitude ey for a
number WV of cycles, anneals it mechanically. Denoting by T the state of the glass “trained”
by such annealing, it turns out that T encodes a memory of er that can subsequently
be read-out. This is illustrated in Fig. 1(e): after training, copies of T are subjected to
single shear cycles with different read-out amplitudes ez. Comparing the trained glass

configuration T with the configurations R reached after the application of a read-out cycle
at various strains er, shows that when the training and read-out amplitudes are close to each
other, ie. er & Ep, so are the corresponding configurations (15). This is shown in Fig. 1(f),
where the particles mean squared displacement (MSD) between T and R is plotted against
read-out amplitudes ¢z for various numbers AN of training cycles. Already after 10 driving
cycles, the MSD curve develops a dip where training and read-out amplitudes coincide. The
encoding and read-out of such memories has been observed experimentally for various soft-
matter systems, including sheared colloids and crumpled elastic sheets under compression
(18, 19, 4, 15, 20). Fig. 1(g) shows an experimental read-out result after training a system

‘Note that in the following our use of the term “soft-spot” , historically associated with the local-
ized eigenmode of a soft vibrational mode, i.e. characterized by a low eigenvalue that approaches
zero as a result of shear, will encompass the notions of plastic events, shear transformations, and
local rearrangements. The term “hot spot” has also been used, as we describe below, to discuss
plastic rearrangements. We prefer to use the term “soft spot” in this context as well. If a distinc-
tion were to be made, soft spots may be considered as the immediate precursors of a plastic event
and hot spots and local rearrangements as their actual (numerical or experimental) realization (See
ref. (9) for a thorough discussion about plastic events and their predictors).

similar memory retrieval from a mesoscale model of a sheared amorphous solid (17).

We shall argue that the mechanism of memory formation and self-organization in soft
matter systems may be relevant for understanding adaptation of simple organisms lacking
a nervous system. Sensing changes by processing environmental inputs and reacting to
these is essential for the survival of organisms. Such adaptation must involve some form of
memory, learning and information processing (21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27). For example, the

1 INTRODUCTION
cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells can dynamically adjust its physical properties according to
mechanical deformations exerted by its environment (28).

The outline of this review is as follows. A natural way to approach memory and self-
organization in disordered solids is to focus on two key concepts: hysteresis and multistabil-
ity. In Section 2 we introduce the tools and concepts recently developed in this context. The
notions of t-graphs, which describe transitions between metastable states, and return-point
memory provide a solid framework within which the memory behavior in disordered solids
can be described. The emergence of mechanical reversibility under annealing is due to a
system of repeatably triggerable instabilities, the soft-spots, which are spatially-localized
in space and exhibit hysteresis. We discuss the role of frustration in soft-spot interactions

and then make an excursion to the Preisach model, which can be thought of as an "ideal
gas” of non-interacting soft-spots. The Preisach model illustrates how driving histories are
encoded as memories via its elementary units of hysteresis, the hysterons.

The mapping of mechanical deformation histories onto paths on a transition graph en-
ables us to directly associate mechanical reversibility with the topology of the graph: limit

cycles and any other repeatable behavior can exist only within its strongly connected com-
ponents, the regions of mutual reachability of the graph. In Section 3, we show that the
formation of memory is robust and need not depend on the nature of driving. Random driv-
ing on large length scales, mimicking environmental fluctuations, or correlated on short time
and length scales, resembling active matter, lead to similar features of memory formation.

We next look in Section 4 more closely at the process of self-organization. We show that
self-organization under mechanical annealing, be it random or deterministic, leads to the
emergence of a persistent soft-spot system, that very much like the idealized Preisach system
can encode memories of deformation histories. We can therefore view self-organization in a
fluctuating environment as a pathway by means of which an internal representation of the
environment is established.

Armed with these insights, we address in Section 5 the question raised at the begin-
ning, namely how memory and self-organization in driven disordered systems can guide us
in understanding how simple organisms adapt to changing environments. This section is
necessarily incomplete and serves to motivate future research. We first review the biological
evidence of history-dependent and anticipatory behavior in simple organisms, discussing the
role of biological switches, and multistability. We make the connection between non-living
and living systems via the notion of dimensional reduction and soft-modes, which are key
ideas underlying the theoretical descriptions in both realms. The ¢-graph description in
driven disordered systems, leading to a focus on soft-spots, is an example of dimensional re-
duction and the emergence of soft-modes. This is followed by an exploration of the parallels
between mechanical annealing and adaptive evolution. We conclude with a brief outlook.

The topics of three recent Annual Reviews complement the ideas and material presented
here: exploring memory formation and its applications in metamaterials (20), learning in
driven disordered systems (22) and the role of soft-modes in biology (29).

2. Self-organization in driven disordered systems: The sheared amorphous
solid

The response of amorphous solids to mechanical deformations described above is not fully
understood even under athermal and quasistatic (AQS) conditions. This is essentially due
to a lack of crystalline order in these amorphous materials, and consequently lack of well

identified structural defects giving rise to plastic events. While this problem attracted the
interest of material scientists since the late 1970s (6), it is only since the 1990s that it also
received the attention of theoretical physicists (30, 7, 31). By now, there are theoretical
models capturing the irreversibility transition under cyclic shearing, such as the approach of
(32) based on an adaptation of the Hébraud-Lequeux model (30), as well as an analytically
tractable mesostate model (33, 34). These latter models capture qualitatively the “phase
diagram” , describing the response and its dependence on sample aging and oscillatory shear
amplitude. However, owing to their mean-field nature, these models do not incorporate any
spatial structure and fail to account for microscopic plastic reversibility.

2.1. The transition graph description of the AQS response

Our starting point is the observation that the mechanical response of an amorphous solid to

external deformation under AQS conditions consists of series of elastic segments interspersed
by instabilities. Such a sequence of transitions between metastable states has a natural
representation in terms of a transition graph (t-graph) (35, 36, 14). The dynamical features
of the AQS response are thereby encoded faithfully in the t-graph topology, providing new
insights into these phenomena (35, 14, 37, 38, 39, 40, 17, 41).

Consider the AQS dynamics of a 2d atomistic amorphous solid that is subjected to shear
strain ¢, as depicted in Fig. 1(a). After its initial preparation, and before the application
of shear, the particle configuration resides in a local minimum x of its high-dimensional
potential energy surface U(x,¢), as schematically illustrated in Fig. 2(a). As we increase
the strain in a slow and adiabatic manner, the energy landscape deforms and the position
of the local energy minimum moves along a hypercurve in configuration space, as indicated
by the blue curve. The amorphous solid adapts to such strain increments by purely elastic
deformation. This elastic response continues until a strain at which the particle configura-
tion ceases to be a local energy minimum and thus becomes unstable. Increasing the strain
slightly further, the system relaxes into a new local energy minimum and this constitutes

a plastic event. Thus, given a locally stable particle configuration x, there exists a range
of strains, applied in the positive and negative directions, over which the amorphous solid
adapts in a reversibly elastic manner and which is punctuated in either direction by plastic
events®. We refer to these curve segments as mesostates (14). They correspond to the

minimized structures of (42) and are also called elastic branches.

With each mesostate A we associate the range of strain values («~ [A],e*[A]), over
which the locally stable configurations transform elastically into each other. Plastic events
occur at e*[A] whereby the system reaches new locally stable configurations which must
necessarily belong to some other mesostates, as indicated by the black and red arrows in
Fig. 2(a). Hence mesostate transitions are triggered at either end of the stability interval
(e [A], e*[A]). We distinguish these by referring to transitions under strain increase and
decrease as U-, respectively, D-transitions. The transitions from A to B or C depicted
in Fig. 2(a) can be represented by a directed graph, as shown in Fig. 2(b) and lead to a
description of mesostate transitions in terms of a transition graph, the t-graph (35, 36, 14).
Here each vertex represents a mesostate A, from which there are two outgoing directed
transitions, U and D, describing the outcome of the plastic events taking place at e*[A].

3This is the implicit function theorem in disguise: mechanical equilibrium requires VxU(x,¢) =
0, and implicitly defines curve segments x(¢) in configuration space.

solid subject to shear. (a) Viewed in the configuration space of particles, the AQS
response to external shear ¢ leads at first to continuous deformations of particle configura-
tions x, tracing out a hypercurve segment in configuration space, called an elastic branch.
ts termination points mark the onset of mechanical instabilities which lead to other elastic
ranches, e.g. transitions from elastic branch A to B and C. Here and in the following
we will denote elastic branches by capital italic letters while we will reserve the bold face
letters U and D, in black and red respectively, to indicate the transition from the upper
and lower stability limit of an elastic branch. (b) The transitions can be represented as a
directed graph whose vertices are the elastic branches. (c) Transition graphs (t-graphs) can
be sampled from standard molecular dynamics simulations and reveal complex topological

towards periodic response under cyclic shear applied to the glass O at various amplitudes
are shown by the dashed pathways. (d) The limit cycle reached from O with training

black/gray and red/orange arrows, respectively. The periodic response corresponds to the
graph cycle traced out by starting from the vertex X, following the black arrows until Y,
and subsequently following the red arrows back to X. The graph-cycles are labeled by their
extreme points, e.g. (X,Y), and exhibit hierarchical nesting, e.g. (F,L) within (F,Y’)
within (X,Y’) within (X,Y). Nesting is characteristic of loop return-point-memory (35).

and D-transitions of maximal length g = 25. Here and in the following we will adopt the
convention to represent U- and D-transitions by arrows colored in gray resp. orange, while
colors black and red will be used to highlight transitions of interest. Note that the t-graph
is non-homogeneous, there are tree-like regions, highly connected regions and bottlenecks
(blue ovals), ie. certain parts of the graph can be reached only through specific vertices.
The conventional way of extracting dynamical features from numerical simulations typ-
ically focuses on macroscopic quantities extracted from time-series, such as the responses in
Fig. 1. The t-graph description of such systems provides a complementary way of obtain-
ing relevant information (14, 38, 40). It gives a bird’s eye view of the possible mechanical
responses of an initially prepared glass O, since the result of applying to O any deforma-
tion protocol, can be traced out by following the corresponding U- or D-transitions on the
graph. In this way, features of the complex AQS response are encoded into the t-graph
topology: the yielding and the irreversibility transitions are all on this graph — somewhere.

2.2. Return-point memory

In Fig. 2(c) the sequences of black and red dashed transitions starting from O indicate
deformation pathways under cyclic shear at various strain amplitudes er (14). The graph-
cycle marked with the endpoints X and Y is the limit cycle reached from O when er = 0.05
(the onset of the irreversibility transition for this system is ¢. = 0.13). Fig. 2(d) is a
detailed view. Under the strain 0 > er + —er — 0, the system traces out the graph-cycle
T + Y — X -T, following the black (red) arrows under strain increase (decrease). The
mesostates X and Y reached at the extreme points ter of the driving are the lower and
upper endpoints of the graph-cycle (X,Y) (35).

In fact, the t-graph excerpt shown is complete, since it contains all possible U- and
D-transition out of each of the mesostates associated with the graph-cycle (X,Y). The
U-transition out of Y, the D-transition out of X, as well as a “rabbit hole” D-transition
(14) out of Z, indicated by the diode sign, lead to states “outside” of the cycle (X,Y),
a statement we will make more precise shortly. We call the subgraph shown in Fig. 2(d)
the loop-graph associated with (X,Y) (35). Remarkably, the loop-graph (X,Y) exhibits
hierarchical nesting of graph-cycles within cycles. One such example is the graph-cycle
(F, L) outlined by the green ellipse in Fig. 2(d), which is a sub-cycle of (F,Y’), which in
turn is a sub-cycle of (X,Y), etc.

The topological nesting of hysteresis cycles is a characteristic feature of return-point-
memory (RPM). Its t-graph-topological manifestation has been called loop return-point-
memory (€RPM) and was defined and analyzed in (35). Roughly, RPM prescribes that
mesostates belonging to a loop-graph can leave it only through its endpoints. As an illustra-
tion, consider the loop-graph (F, LZ). Any mesostate inside this loop, i.e. inside the shaded
green area, must go first through F or L before it can reach any other mesostate outside of
the loop’. The placement of loop-graph vertices highlights the (RPM structure.

RPM is a feature associated with ferromagnets and more generally systems with inter-
actions where the instability of one part has a destabilizing effect on other parts (43, 44, 35).
Due to the quadrupolar nature of the elastic interactions in amorphous solids (45, 6), there
is also frustration: instabilities in one part of the system may not only destabilize but also

4The D-transition out of Z violates (RPM, which requires that following the D-arrows from Z,
X must be reached (14). The diode-sign indicates the one-way nature of this transition.

8 2 SELF-ORGANIZATION IN DRIVEN DISORDERED SYSTEMS: THE SHEARED AMORPHOUS SOLID
stabilize other parts. One would therefore not expect sheared amorphous solids to exhibit
RPM, and the hierarchical nesting of cycles observed comes as a surprise. In fact, loop-
graphs extracted from simulations exhibit near perfect (RPM, even at strain amplitudes
where interactions between soft-spots cannot be ignored (14). These findings are consistent
with experiments that probe memory formation and RPM in non-Brownian suspensions
(46), sheared colloids (10, 19), crumpled elastic sheets (4), and simulations of sheared
amorphous solids (12, 16).

The nesting of graph-cycles also explains the memory formation upon read-out, as shown
in Figs. 1(f) and (g). Starting at T’ and applying cyclic shear at read-out amplitudes er,
will confine the response to a sub-graph of the loop-graph (X,Y) from which it is possible
to return to the trained hysteresis cycle, as long as the applied strains are such that we
avoid exiting the loop graph via X,Y or Z.

2.3. Emergence of mechanical reversibility

It is apparent that the applied oscillatory strain not only has caused the system to evolve
towards a cyclic response, but at the same time the response has self-organized itself into a
hierarchy of nested sub-cycles. These features generalize to the graph-topological notion of
mutual reachability: a pair of mesostates A and B is mutually reachable, if there exist defor-
mation pathways from A to B as well as from B to A. Mutual reachability is an equivalence
relation and partitions the vertex set of the t-graph into equivalence classes, the strongly
connected components or SCCs (47). | Observe that all mesostates shown in Fig. 2(d) are
mutually reachable and hence part of a single SCC. In fact, any mechanically reversible
response must be confined to a single SCC, as transitions out of an SCC are by definition
irreversible. The partition into SCCs allows us to classify the plastic events accompany-
ing the transitions of the t-graph as being plastically reversible (intra-SCC transitions) or
plastically irreversible (inter-SCC transitions) (38).

The transitions shown in Fig. 2(d) are plastic events that are due to 13 soft-spots whose

locations in the sample have been marked by the green ellipses in Fig. 2(e). These soft-
spots turn out to be two-state systems that hysteretically switch between states as the
applied strain is increased or decreased. In fact, they emulate the hysterons of the Preisach
model which we discuss in Section 2.6. The blue and red labels next to some transitions in
Fig. 2(d) indicate soft-spots changing states. Note how a subset of the soft-spots is active
in sub-cycles of the t-graph, such as those in the loop-graph (F’, L) highlighted in green.

Soft-spots interact with each other via the long-range elastic-deformations triggered
by their state changes which cause redistribution of local stresses, cf. Fig. l(c). As a
result, soft-spots can alter the switching behavior of other soft-spots, they can give rise to
new ones or disable some (by making the corresponding region respond elastically). The
mechanical annealing by cyclic shear has thus led to self-organization via the selection of
an interacting soft-spot system which is also persistent (39): soft-spots are not only active
when traversing the limit-cycle, but subsets can selectively change states in sub-cycles.
This persistency in turn gives rise to mechanically reversible behavior, whose extent is
captured by the SCCs. SCCs ultimately facilitate memory formation by making possible
mechanical driving protocols that can bring back the system to its trained state. SCC
sizes and their accessibility via mechanical deformations characterizes the extent to which
a system responds in a mechanically reversible manner (38, 40).

2.4. The role of frustration in mechanical annealing

We turn next to the role of frustration which is part of the soft-spot interactions. To
motivate this, consider the “rabbit-hole” transition out of Z in Fig. 2(d).
where the interactions between soft-spots have led to the creation of a new soft-spot, labeled
v in panels (d) and (e). The creation of this soft spot has altered the particle configuration

This is a case

in an irreversible manner, leading to a premature exit from the loop-graph (X,Y). That is,
without passing through its endpoints X or Y, which would have required the application
of strains with magnitudes larger than the training strain ey. The rabbit-hole transitions
that end up by-passing the endpoints of a loop are a consequence of frustration, which is
a characteristic of soft-spot interactions. If the return point memory property was obeyed
such “rabbit-hole” transitions could not occur (44, 35).

The classical route to return point memory is through a partial ordering of mesostates
that is preserved under the application of driving. It is called the no-passing (NP) property?
and was formulated first in the context of elastic manifolds driven through random media
(43). NP implies RPM, as was proven under general conditions in (44) and reviewed
thin the context of mesostates and t-graphs in (35). The mechanism underlying NP is
related to how the triggering of an instability affects the switching thresholds of the other

Ww

instabilities. In the context of magnets and scalar spins, ferromagnetic interactions implies
NP, thereby leading to RPM (44). The sidebar below explores consequences of NP on the
t-graph topology.

Antiferromagnetic interactions lead to frustration and therefore tend to break NP, but
this is not necessarily always the case (48). However, when frustration is present and NP
does not hold, then (i) SCCs do not have to be loop-graphs anymore, (ii) they can be exited
prematurely via rabbit holes, and (iii) it may take more than one driving cycle to land ina
trapping SCC, if at all. Thus interactions that give rise to frustration will tend to provide a
low dimensional driving with much wider access to the plethora of configurational degrees
freedom. The configuration space may be huge, but the interactions determine how much
of it can be accessed by the driving.

Implications of NP on the ¢-graph topology

The presence of NP implies: (i) under oscillatory shear, a limit cycle is reached after at most one driving
cycle (44, 35), (ii) SCCs are £RPM loop-graphs (X, Y) and can therefore be exited only via X or Y (35, 37),
and (iii) these exits happen when ¢ > et [Y] or e < e [X]. From (iii) it follows that if A belongs to the

SCC (X,Y), any driving protocol ¢(t) such that e~ [X] < e(t) <

e*[Y] will confine the system to (X,Y).

Moreover, (i) via (ii) implies that an SCC (X,Y) that is left via its upper exit Y must lead to an SCC
(X’, Y’) that is more trapping in the forward and reverse direction, i.e. e*[Y’] > e*[Y] and e[X’] < e" [X].
Likewise, an exit from (X,Y) via X leads also to more trapping SCCs. This is a necessary condition for
(i) to hold. Thus NP imposes strong constraints on the transitions between SCCs by canalizing the driven
systems into increasingly more trapping SCCs (35).

2.5. Organization of soft-spots in determining flow properties

Although our discussion so far has been in the context of plastic rearrangements in glasses,
drawing largely on computer simulation results, the idea of soft spots and their restructuring
as internal variables that determine flow behavior encompasses a variety of soft solids,
such as confined emulsions (49), colloidal glasses (50), bubble rafts (51), foams (52) or
granular materials (53). Within the energy landscape based framework of “soft glassy
rheology” (54, 55), the rate of transitions between energy states (equivalent to nodes in the t-
graphs in the discussion above), often termed “fluidity”, plays a central role. A relationship
between fluidity and emergent localized structures was proposed by Goyon et al. (49) to
provide a physical interpretation of confined emulsion experiments. It was directly visualized
in granular matter (53), where the spatiotemporal dynamics of localized deformations,
equivalent to the “soft spots” described above, (see Fig. 3) were linked to a fluidity variable
that enters a simple “soft glassy rheology” model (55). Creep dynamics and the suppression
of the fluidization threshold by mechanical agitation in granular packings have also been
interpreted in terms of the soft spot dynamics and its relation to fluidity (56, 57).

2.6. Excursion: The Preisach model, return-point memory and mapping
histories

The system of persistent soft-spots that emerges from mechanical annealing emulates a col-
lection of hysterons, i.e. two-state systems with hysteretic state-changes. In this excursion
we assume that such a soft-spot system has been established by annealing, and we wil
study how these encode memories of the driving histories. This leads us to the Preisach
model, which was introduced by F. Preisach in 1935 to understand hysteresis in magnets
(58). The model describes the hysteretic switching of a collection of hysterons but ignores
interactions between these®. Still, it is a useful model illustrating clearly how memory o}
deformation history is encoded into internal states (69). Our excursion is based on (37, 70).

The Preisach hysteron is defined by two switching thresholds e*, such that when € < e+,
the hysteron can be in state 1, whereas it can be in state 0 when € > € , as illustrated
in Fig. 4(a). Hysteresis occurs when e«~ < e+. Between ¢~ and et, the hysteron can be
in either of its states, and the actual state chosen will depend on the driving history. The
Preisach model exhibits return-point memory (71), thus its t-graph obeys (RPM.

In the discrete Preisach model, we consider a set of N hysterons, each with a pair o!

distinct switching thresholds and such that e7 < ¢}.

It is assumed that each hysteron
couples independently to the external drive e. Thus there are ON possible hysteron config-
urations. We call the two configurations in which all hysterons are either in state 0 or 1,
the saturated configurations and denote them by 0 and 1, respectively. In the following, it
will be sometimes more convenient to identify hysteron configurations by specifying the set
I of hysterons that are in state 1, so that 0 + 0, while 1 © {1,2,..., N}.

A hysteron configuration I is said to be stable at a drive ¢, if the state assignment of
each hysteron is compatible with its switching fields: for each 7 € I we require €} <6,
while for each i € I° the condition « < ef must hold, with [° being the set-complement
of I. A necessary and sufficient condition for all of these inequalities to be simultaneously

®Systems with interacting hysterons were initially introduced in (59) and are receiving renewed
interest (60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68). They were reviewed recently in (20).

Figure 4: The Preisach model. (a) A Preisach hysteron i as a two-state system with
hysteretic transitions between states 0 and 1 at switching fields ef, (b) The two possible
main hysteresis loop-graphs of a system of N = 2 independent hysterons. Such graphs
are called Preisach graphs. Vertices are labeled by hysteron configurations. Labels next to
transitions indicate the hysteron that changes state. Hysterons switch states independently
and we label them according to the order in which they switch from state 0 to 1, see black
labels next to transitions from 00 to 11. This leaves the order in which hysterons switch
back to 0 undetermined, which we prescribe by p. For N = 2 hysterons, the possible
switch-back sequences are p = 12 and p = 21, as indicated by the red labels next to the
transitions from 11 to 00. (c) The Preisach graphs of p = 231 and p = 2341. Due to loop
return-point memory, the Preisach graph of p = 2341 can be described as a merger of the
p = 231 graph (inside orange rectangle) and a certain subgraph (green rectangle inside)

that is copied and connected to it by the two transitions involving the state changes of the
fourth hysteron. (d) The number of vertices of the Preisach graph of p is equal to number
of increasing subsequences contained in p. Each increasing subsequence can be seen as a
deformation history that is applied to 00...0, mapping it thereby to a distinct vertex of
the Preisach graph. This is illustrated for the case p = 21845367 and the increasing
subsequence 2, 4,5,6,7, whose deformation path leading to o is shown by the U- and D-
transitions higlighted in black and red, respectively.

As is apparent from 1., to determine whether a configuration of hysterons I is a

mesostate or not, it suffices to know the rank ordering of the set of switching fields ee.

A knowledge of their actual values is not necessary. Since hysterons couple independently,
without loss of generality we assume that

switches. Details on the role of the ordering of switching fields can be found in (37, 72).
Here we will be interested in the main hysteresis loop and its sub-cycles, i.e. the loop graph
bounded by the two saturated states 0 and 1. We call this loop graph the Preisach graph.
We show next that the topology of the Preisach graph is uniquely determined by p.

To do so, we consider first the transitions out of a mesostate I. Denote by i+[I] the sites
at which minimum and maximum of the inequalities in 1. are attained, so that ¢,, =" [J]
and et = e'[I]. These are the least stable sites, ie. the sites that will lose stability first
when ¢ is reduced to €7 [J] or increased to e* [I]. Consider the case when ¢ = e* [I], so that
i* [I] becomes unstable. Denote by J = IU {i* [J]}, the hysteron configuration obtained by
changing the hysteron state of i+ from 0 to 1. It is readily shown (37) that (i) J is a stable
configuration and (ii) J is stable at e*[I], ic. the inequality e~ [J] < et [I] < e*[J] holds.
An analogous result holds for the transition at ¢ =e [I] and these together define the U-
and D-transitions out of mesostate J. An immediate consequence of the above observations
is that the Preisach model does not exhibit avalanches, since state changes under D or U
involve a single hysteron flip only.

The Preisach graphs for N = 2 can be worked out readily by starting in the lower
saturated state 00 and following the D- and U-transitions, as defined above. The two
N = 2 Preisach graphs, corresponding to p = 12 and p = 21, are shown in Fig. 4(b). The
hysteron configurations are indicated next to each mesostate. The label besides a transition
indicates the hysteron that changes its state.

The left part of Fig. 4(c) shows the Preisach graph for N = 3 and p = 231. Consider
next the N = 4 Preisach graph with p = 2341. We may think of this as augmenting the
p = 231 system by a fourth hysteron as follows. Starting again from the lower saturated
state 0, as long as we do not cause a state change of the 4th hysteron to 1, the possible
transitions are those given by the Preisach graph of p = 231 = p_. This is the sub-graph
contained inside the orange rectangle. Clearly, by our ordering of the upper switching fields,
the 4th hysteron can only switch to 1 after all other hysterons are in state 1, i.e. when
we are in the state 1110, leading then to the upper saturated state 1111. Once there, we
can now reduce and increase the driving as long as hysteron 4 does not revert its state to
0. Since p = 2341, this means that (i) we can only change the states of hysterons 2 and
3, and (ii) 4 will return to state 0 only after hysterons 2 and 3 are in state 0, ie. when
reaching 1001, so that after switching back 4, the hysteron configuration will be 1000. In
fact, the loop graph bounded by 1001 and 1111 is generated p, = 23, which is isomorphic
to the Preisach graph with p = 12 (rectangles shaded in green). Note that this loop graph
is “copied” from the corresponding sub-graph generated by p— = 231 (green box inside
the orange rectangle). From our discussion it is clear that (i) the two permutations p_ and
p+ describe the two sub-graphs and (ii) that these two Preisach graphs are joined into the
Preisach graph of p. The two permuations p— and p, can be generated from p as follows.
The permutation p— is obtained from p upon removal of the element N, while p+ is the
permutation obtained by removing from p the element N as well as all other elements that
come after it.

Denote by P(p) the number of vertices of the Preisach graph that is generated by p.

M4 2 SELF-ORGANIZATION IN DRIVEN DISORDERED SYSTEMS: THE SHEARED AMORPHOUS SOLID
The construction of the Preisach graph of p from the Preisach graphs of the permutations
p+ described above, implies that

P(p) = P(p-) + P(p+). 4.

Treating p as a sequence, define an increasing subsequence as a subsequence of elements
of p that is strictly increasing. Denote by \V(p) the number of increasing subsequences
contained in p. It turns out that P(p) = N’(p), ie. the Preisach graph generated by p has as
many vertices as their are increasing subsequences of p. To see this, let p be a permutation
of N > 1 elements. The increasing subsequences of p either contain N and hence end in N,
or they do not. The number of the former kind is (p+), while that of the latter is given
by N(p—), so that N(p) = N(p-) +N (p+). Given that (1) = P(1) = 2, and proceeding
inductively, it follows that N’(p) = P(p).

The equality of the number of increasing subsequences and vertices of the corresponding
Preisach graph is not a coincidence. As was shown in (70), there is a one to one mapping
between these two sets that moreover highlights the role of return-point memory underlying
the topology of the Preisach graph. Taking again the lower saturated state as a reference
state and assigning it the empty subsequence, we assign to each increasing subsequence of
p a mesostate as follows. We regard the corresponding increasing subsequence as a driving
history that, when applied to 00...0, leads to the corresponding state it is mapped to.
This is illustrated in Fig. 4(d) for the Preisach graph generated by p = 21845367 and
the increasing subsequence (2, 4,5,6,7). Reading this subsequence from right to left, and
starting from 00000000, the sequence of applied drives is as follows: we first increase the
driving until the 7th hysteron changes its state from 0 to 1. Next, we decrease the driving
until the 6th hysteron reverts its state to 0. This is then followed by an increase of the

driving until hysteron 5 is in state 1, a subsequent decrease until hysteron 4 is at 0 and
a final increase until hysteron 2 is in state 1. We assign the mesostate o = 11101010
reached in this manner to the driving history (2,4,5,6,7). The proof of this one-to-one
correspondence and its connection to return-point memory is given in (70).

We conclude with a few observations. The Preisach graph is an SCC and the mapping
establishes a correspondence between driving histories and its mesostates. The possibility of
such a construction is due to the nested hierarchy of hysteresis cycles which is a consequence
of (RPM. It furnishes a filtering of the deformation histories, playing the role of a decision
tree. In fact, the hierarchical nesting of the graph-loops can be represented in terms of a
tree (35, 37). To see this, refer again to the right panel of Fig. 4(c). We can view this as a
decomposition of the Preisach graph of p = 2341 into the two Preisach graphs generated by
p— = 231 and py = 23 and connected to each other by the transitions of the 4th hysteron.
The p_ = 231 graph consists out of all mesostates in which hysteron 4 is in state 0, while
its state in the p, = 23 graph is 1. Since, each of these sub-graphs is a Preisach graph
itself, the same decomposition into two sub-graphs can be performed on these as well. This
decomposition is continued until all Preisach graphs contain single vertices, they are the
Preisach graph generated by the empty permutation, i.e. N = 0.

The Preisach model, despite its limitations, demonstrates how a system of hysteretic bi-
stable switches is capable of recognizing patterns of environmental histories, mapping such
information into states, by organizing the states and the transitions between theses into a
t-graph with nested cycles. Thus the hysteron configurations and the transitions between
them establish a representation of the history of the environment that drives it. We have
seen that such persistent hysteron systems emerge as a result of driving by oscillatory shear.

The QMEP mesoscale model of an amorphous solid

3. Self-organization in a fluctuating environment

In the previous section we have described the self-organization of an amorphous solid when
subject to oscillatory shear. The driving led to the emergence of a persistent soft-spot
system that established the mechanically reversible behavior. These observations lead to the
question, whether driving by cyclic shear is necessary for establishing a persistent system
of mechanical instabilities, and more specifically, whether such self-organization can be
achieved also by random driving protocols. In this section we consider the response of an
amorphous solid when subjected to driving by either (i) a randomly fluctuating external
shear or (ii) active particles, where each particle experiences also Langevin forces. In both
cases it is found that the response self-organizes into a state of high mechanical reversibility.

3.1. Memory formation under random driving

We first ask whether a random deformation protocol confined to a strain range ter suffices
to establish a persistent interacting soft-spot system (39). That this is indeed the case
was shown recently in simulations of a mesoscale elastoplastic model of an amorphous solid
with a quenched disorder landscape, called the QMEP model (41). The QMEP model repro-
duces qualitatively and quantitatively many features of the AQS phenomenology, including
yielding, the irreversibility transition, topological properties of t-graphs extracted from it
(40), as well as memory formation under cyclic shearing (17), cf. Fig. lh. The sidebar
summarizes key features of the QMEP model.

A 2d amorphous solid is coarse-grained into an N x N lattice of mesoscale cells (7,7), see Fig. 5(a). With
each cell we associate a stack of local elastic branches, which are indexed by integers £;; and capture the local
stress strain response under elastic deformations. Each local elastic branch ¢ is characterized by quenched

random variables: the local plastic strain aly and stress thresholds of

i.e cf Fig. 5(a). Once the total

stress on a local elastic branch exceeds its stress threshold, a transition to a neighboring branch occurs,

accompanied by a redistribution of internal stresses which may cause avalanches.

The mechanical properties of a global elastic branch A are determined via the local branch properites by
specifying for each cell (i, 7) its branch index ¢;;[A], and thereby define the mesostate A. The limits e*[A]
of global elastic branches are determined by the strain at which the first cell reaches it local threshold. This

is very similar to how instabilities are triggered in the Preisach model of Section 2.6. Note that while in the
QMEP model transitions between local branches are reversible, those between global branches are generally

not, since cells triggering the U- and D-transitions out of it will be different.

16

We take our random deformation protocol to be an unbiased random walk along the
external strain axis with reflecting boundaries at shear strains +émax. Starting at the origin
€ = 0, our random driving consists of taking strain steps of fixed size 6€ = Emax/M, so that
it takes at least M steps for the walker to reach one of the reflecting boundaries from the
origin. In analogy to driving by deterministic cyclic shear, we define a random shear cycle
by first passages from one boundary to the other and back (41). Fig. 5(b) shows a typical
deformation path with the freshly prepared glass Oo at zero applied strain, and the first
cycle leading first to +é€max at Yi then —émax at X1, and a return to zero strain at Oy.

Further details of the random walk implementation and cycle definition are given in (41).

We apply V random cycles to a fresh glass Oo at the end of which we reach the trained
mesostate T. Read-outs are performed by subjecting copies of T to single cycles of de-
terministic oscillatory cyclic shear at amplitudes ep, cf. Fig. 5(c). Fig. 5(d) shows the
result for read-outs after various numbers of random training cycles. The distance d(T, R)
between trained and read-out mesostates is determined from their branch configurations
:;[T] and £;;[R] as the fraction of cells (i,j) for which ¢;;[T'] 4 ¢i;[R], i.e. the fraction of
cells that at the end of the read-out cycle have not returned to their local branches at T.
Already after a few random training cycles, a cusp of d(T, R) develops at ez © Emax, getting
more pronounced with increasing cycles. Fig. 5(e) shows read-outs from glasses trained for
20 random cycles with different strain ranges (vertical dashed lines), demonstrating that a
memory of €max is encoded.

Fig. 5(£) shows the result of applying two read-out cycles to T’ and comparing the states
R and R» reached at the end of the first and second cycle, as illustrated in Fig. 5(c).

Referring to point (i) of the sidebar describing the consequences of NP, if NP were to hold,
then d(R, R2) = 0, for any amplitude er and state T to which the two-cycle read-out is
applied, i.e. regardless of whether T is a result of some prior training or not (43, 44, 35).
What we see instead is that d(R, R2) remains close to zero only as long as €r < Emax, beyond
which it starts to rise quickly. Thus while the first driving cycles moves the configuration
away from T and towards R, the second cycle returns it close to R. When restricted to
ER S Emax, the trained glasses exhibit a highly mechanically reversible response, while for
read-out strains larger than €max, reversibility is rapidly lost. The application of an external
random driving thus suffices to imprint a mechanical memory on the disordered solid.

3.2. Activity-induced annealing of an amorphous solid

Another form of driving that has recently been actively investigated, bearing strong analo-
gies to driving by applied shear, as well as incorporating elements of spatial and temporal
fluctuations, is driving by active forces. There has been intense interest in investigating
the dynamics and steady states of self-propelled particles (73, 74), with emphasis on mod-
eling biological systems across length scales, from bird flocks to the cytoskeleton and other
subcellular structures. Some of these contexts, such as modeling confluent tissue (75) have
motivated investigation of active glasses (dense assemblies of particles propelled by active
forces), with the transition from jammed to fluidized states being of particular interest
(76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82). The role of active forces in the context of memory has also
received attention in recent times (83, 84, 85, 81, 86). Memory retrieval in the Hopfield
model of associative memory, and related systems, in the presence of active noise has been
analyzed recently, to show that an active component in the noise leads to an enhancement
of memory capacity (83, 84, 86). An appealing connection between the presence of active
noise, and memory enhancement through the process of Hebbian “unlearning” or “dream-
ing” has been discussed in (86). These works address the role of active driving in memory
retrieval. In addition, memory formation through the application of active driving, in direct
analogy with memory formation under cyclic or random shear discussed above, have also
been addressed recently (81, 85). In (81), memory formation under driving by active forces,
with a finite persistence time for the active propulsion direction was studied. The “read”
protocol involves the application of active driving of different magnitudes for a short period
of time. Rather than the displacements of particles, the additional annealing, in the form of
the magnitude of the change in energy, is monitored. The magnitude of the energy change
exhibits a minimum at the training magnitude of the active force, and thus a memory. This
memory effect bears resemblance both to the memory formation under external shear dis-
cussed here, and memory in thermal glassy systems (including spin glasses and molecular
glasses) of the temperature at which the glass is aged (87, 88). Significantly for the present
discussion, solids driven by active forces presents another example of memory formation
under fluctuating driving conditions, which also has significant biological relevance.

4. Self-organization and learning: From non-living to living systems

In the preceding sections, we have described the mechanical annealing of a sheared amor-
phous solid when subjected to oscillatory and random protocols of driving. Under these
conditions, the system self-organizes its response by the triggering of spatially localized
instabilities, the soft-spots, which eventually leads to a steady-state, whose mechanical re-

4. SELF-ORGANIZATION AND LEARNING: FROM NON-LIVING TO LIVING SYSTEMS
sponse is governed by a collection of persistent soft-spots. The soft-spots are multi-stable
and transitions between their local states are hysteretic. The persistence of the soft-spots
means that their instabilities can be repeatedly triggered and in turn gives rise to the high-
degree of mechanical reversibility. The imposed driving shapes the steady-state mechanical
response of the amorphous solid and in this way imprints a memory. Such memories can
encode patterns of environmental histories. Along the way, we have seen that the t-graph
description provides a natural way to track the evolution of mechanical instabilities and to
probe the emergence of mechanical reversibility.

4.1. Soft-spot transitions, slow-manifolds and soft-modes

The t-graph description, by focusing on the transitions between mesostates, has coarse-
grained the AQS dynamics into a pair of maps U and D describing the transitions between
mesostates under increase and decrease of the deformation parameter, cf. Fig. 2(a) and
(b). As we have seen, dynamical features such as memory formation and reversibility
manifest themselves at the level of the t-graph. However, the graph-topology depends on the
underlying microscopic properties, namely the relaxation pathways that are followed when
mesostates become unstable, giving rise to plastic events. These relaxations are governed by
the collection of multistable and spatially localized soft-spots. Their state change induces
a long-range redistribution of local elastic stresses that can create, disable or alter the
switching behavior of other soft-spots. These interactions govern the transition pathways
of plastic events. The dynamics of soft-spots thus forms a description of the amorphous solid
at a mesoscopic scale, an intermediate scale that is coarser than the particle configurations,
yet finer than the coarse-grained t-graph description. This is the idea behind introducing
mesoscale models like the QMEP model, described in section 3.1.

The dynamics of soft-spots is closely related to the quadrupolar nature of the stress-
redistributions, which gives rise to frustration. There is an intuitive way to see why such
a form of stress-distribution can lead to spatially localized instabilities. Consider first a
stress redistribution of the kind where the local stress-drop of a soft-spot that yielded
would be redistributed such that only additional loads are placed on the rest of the system.
Ferromagnetic interactions in magnets are of this type. It is also what happens when parts
of an elastic interface depin and the load that is relieved is passed on to the other parts
of the interface. At a macroscopic length scale, this corresponds to a diffusion of local
stresses. In the long run, such diffusive processes tend towards an equalization of stresses

across the system. Owing to its quadrupolar nature, stress redistributions under shear
have also a component that resembles negative diffusion, i.e. diffusion with a negative
diffusion coefficients. This implies that at some parts of the sample local stresses, rather
than diffusing away, may become more concentrated. Evidence for such behaviour and
related phenomenology has been observed in a wide range of amorphous solids (3), including
granular materials, as those described in Fig. 3, involving frictional interactions (53, 56, 89).

Soft-spots are multistable, transiting from one state to another involving localized rear-
rangements. In the case of a persistent soft-spot, such transitions are also reversible. The
rearrangement of local particle configurations follows a slow manifold which is established
in terms of soft-modes. A very accessible exposition of these concepts has been given in
(29). In the context of amorphous solids and interparticle interactions, we can think of
the configuration space characterised by soft mode transitions as low-dimensional valleys
in a high-dimensional potential energy landscape, towards which the system evolves under

training. As a result, we may expect the system configuration to move along such valleys
in a similar fashion regardless of the type of external perturbation. Thus local particle
rearrangements under different types of loading will be similar. This is why and how a
collection of soft-spots prepared by some annealing protocol can respond rather similarly
when driven by AQS shear, low temperature fluctuations (90) or active driving. If in each
case the same soft-spots are activated, the final mechanical response will be the same.

It is believed that soft-modes underlie diverse relaxation mechanisms when a biological
equilibrium state is perturbed by environmental or internal changes. In each of these cases
the perturbations may project down on the same soft modes and hence follow a common
response pathway (29). We will discuss this point in Section 5.

4.2. Mirroring of the dynamics of the system and its environment establishes
a representation of the latter by the former

The amorphous solid subject to random driving is a prototype for a system interacting with
a fluctuating environment. The self-organization leads to a mechanically reversible steady-
state in which the subsequent response of the system is correlated with that of the driving.
As we have seen in the case of the Preisach model, the triggering sequence of instabilities
permits one to infer features of the dynamics of the environment, e.g. Fig. 4(d). In this
way, the soft-spot states furnish a digital encoding of their environmental history. These
correlation persists as long as the range of the fluctuations of the driving does not change
appreciably.

Pattern recognition and machine learning

A classical pattern recognition (PR) task is the recognition of hand-written digits representing D =
{0,1,...,9}. Samples provided as N x N pixel images, can be described by vectors in an N? dimen-

sional space Y whose components represent the intensity of each pixel. In both supervised and unsupervised

learning, the task is to determine a classifier, i.e. a map y from ¥ to D, assigning to a given hand-written

digit image x the label d € D it represents. In supervised learning, y is a parametrized function, “learned”

by finding the parameters minimizing the classification error in a training set of images and their ground
truth labels, (a;,d:),. The estimation of y furnishes the classification regions Ry = {a € ¥ : y(a) = d}. In

unsupervised learning, there are only input samples a; but no labels. In algorithms like k-means clustering,

the learning goal is determining from the input data cluster centers in ¥ for each digit d. New inputs x

are classified as the digit d whose cluster center is nearest. The cluster centers provide a quantization of X,

furnishing a compressed representation of digits. A good introduction to PR and machine learning is (91).

20

In fact, we can think of the system’s interactions with its fluctuating environment as
having established an internal representation of its environment: the dynamics of the en-
vironment is mirrored by the dynamics of the system’s instabilities that are triggered by
it (24, 21). Evidently, the process of self-organization has led to a capability which in the
context of machine learning would be associated with pattern recognition and unsupervised
learning of a representation, but without a pre-defined task and a generic optimization
or training procedure to achieve it (see side bar). The correlation between the system’s
response at steady-state and the fluctuations of the environment that they mirror can be

4. SELF-ORGANIZATION AND LEARNING: FROM NON-LIVING TO LIVING SYSTEMS
Motivation: Cell-Motitility and Chemotaxis

Bacteria can sense environmental gradients of nutrients, stresses or magnetic fields and control their motion
accordingly. The resulting motion is called chemo-, duro and magnetotaxis, respectively. The cytoskeleton
of eukaryotic cells can adjust its mechanical properties according to mechanical deformations exerted by its
environment in an active manner (28). In microbiology, the molecular and protein elements involved in the
sensory circuitry of E. coli as well as their link to microorganism motility are well-studied (93). From a
functional point of view, bacterial chemotaxis can be viewed as a coupled network of bi-stable elements (94).
Each receptor is an input site for the ligand, which transmits information to the motor, the output being
a possible change in swimming direction. The sensory elements carry essentially two activity states, whose
switch point is controlled by a feedback loop stemming from a methylation process of the receptors that
achieves memory, adaptation and coupling between the different receptors (see review by Lan et al.(95)).
This combination leads to the ability to dynamically compute chemical gradients with a high sensitivity
that can only be understood as a cooperative switch effect involving tens of sites.

regarded as an elementary form of environmental sensing. Given that a model of a disor-
dered system with minimal ingredients — disorder, a built-in frustration in redistribution of
external loads and negligible thermal effects — is able to self-organize in a manner described
above, one may wonder whether simple biological organisms lacking a nervous system, re-

purpose such essentially “for free” infrastructure when adapting to changing environments.
The title of a paper that addresses such possibilities in a general setting summarizes this
point rather well by asking whether self-organization proposes what natural selection dis-
poses? (92). In the following section we will address this question, by reviewing the biolog-

ical evidence, as well as theoretical approaches that have been put forward. The sidebar on
cell-motility and chemotaxis serves as a motivation.

5. What can memory and self-organization in driven disordered systems

teach us about how simple organisms adapt to changing environments?

Sensing its environment by processing environmental cues and reacting to these, is essential
for the survival of organisms in a changing environment and determines their evolutionary

success. The adaptation of even relatively simple organisms, such as bacteria, to changing
environments must involve some form of information processing, memory and learning (96,
24, 97, 98, 26, 25, 99, 27, 100, 101).

5.1. History-dependent behavior in simple organisms — the biological

evidence

The issue of memory and learning in unicellular organisms has been revisited in two recent
reviews (26, 27). As summarized in Gershman et al. (26), the question whether unicellular
organisms, which lack a nervous system, can learn, for example by exhibiting conditioned

reflexes dates back to the beginnings of the last century, and is debated to this day (102).

Part of the difficulty is that in vivo experiments which aim to demonstrate phenomena

of memory formation and learning, require controls for many confounding factors that could
lead to false-positive results. This becomes more of an issue the more complex the organism

is — even when it is unicellular. There is increasing evidence that metabolic regulation of the
cell exhibits history-dependent behavior (HDB), as discussed in the review by Vermersh et
al. (27), which is part of a special issue on non-genetic memory in microorganisms. Its focus
is on HDB, which the authors take as an operational definition of memory. While the review
discusses mostly eukaryotic unicellular organisms and pathways of memory formation that
are specific to these, it highlights the role of non-DNA based mechanisms of inheritance
that are part and parcel of any unicellular organism that multiplies via cell division.

Particularly relevant for bacteria is the perfect or imperfect cloning of its metabolic
state as a result of division. This is how the protein contents of a cell, including those
responsible for gene regulation, are passed on to subsequent generations. In this way, a
stress-response pathway may remain active over many generations, even though the source
of stress has subsided. Likewise, the concentration of any metabolite that is no longer
actively synthesized will be successively diluted from generation to generation, thereby
providing a mechanism of forgetting as the stimulus fades away over time (103).

This is one of the reasons why exploring phenomena of memory formation and learning in
much simpler non-living settings, such as that of driven disordered systems, is of interest.
Such studies provide minimal model systems with a limited yet well-understood set of
parameters that can be controlled. At the same time, these efforts enable us to uncover the
necessary and sufficient conditions for such phenomena to emerge. Gaining such insights and
having simple paradigmatic models at one’s disposal, should provide a sound perspective
from which to re-assess the extent that simple organisms can learn and retain memories of
their past and how this effects their behavior.

5.2. Internal representations and anticipatory behavior

There are two primary responses in which an organism may cope with a changing envi-
ronment and the stresses that these induce: (i) by sensing environmental cues in order to
anticipate and prepare for the change (97), or (ii) by activating multiple stress mitigating
pathways in advance, a phenomenon that is called bet-hedging (104). Both of these types
of responses rely on phenotypic plasticity, which is the ability of an organism to change its
characteristics in response to environmental changes without altering its genetic content.
Such responses come at a cost, as the cell has to reallocate limited resources in order to
synthesize the stress-mitigating metabolites (105), and which may end up being of no use, if
the anticipated changes did not happen. Biologist say that such strategies involve a fitness
cost, since the price to pay for them is typically a reduction of growth. Thus in order to be
viable, the fitness benefits of such strategies have to outweigh their cost, an issue that has
been taken up in (106). Generally, anticipatory behavior requires the organism to have
an underlying model that facilitates making predictions. Such models can be stochastic
(101) or deterministic. For example, the posterior distribution in Bayesian inference serves
the role of a model representing the environment, in this case the observed data. The rel-
evance of representations via internal models in biological systems has been discussed in
(24, 21, 107).

An example of an anticipatory strategy seen in bacteria is the switch from aerobic to
anaerobic respiration after EZ. coli has been exposed to a change from ambient temperatures
to 37°C. This metabolic switch is believed to be in anticipation of encountering an anaerobic
environment, as would be the case when EL. coli enters the oral cavity on its way to the
gastrointestinal tract (24). The environment of the gastrointestinal tract has many bacterial

5 WHAT CAN MEMORY AND SELF-ORGANIZATION IN DRIVEN DISORDERED SYSTEMS TEACH US ABOUT HO
strains competing for limited resources, which thereby impedes colonization by new strains.
Switching to an anaerobic metabolism early will convey an advantage to the invading strain
relative to other invaders, by reducing the lag time that otherwise would ensue if the
switching was made after the absence of oxygen had been detected. Moreover, the same
study shows that such anticipatory responses can also be forgotten. By subjecting EF.
coli populations to environments where the change in temperature and oxygen levels were
counter-correlated, i.e. both levels increased and decreased in parallel, resulted in selecting
for strains that did well in these new conditions, but poorly in conditions mimicking the
transition into the gastrointestinal tract. These findings demonstrate that the sequence of
temperature change followed by metabolic switch is not hard-wired into the cells regulatory
structure, but can be altered in principle. In the words of its authors the switching capability
is learned as a result of “evolution over geological time scales“ (24). In the language of driven
disordered systems, we may think of this is an emergent and reversible response produced.
by the training.

5.3. The role of multi-stability, hysteresis and soft-modes in biological
systems

The Preisach model illustrates how a collection of bi-stable elements is capable of recognizing
patterns of environmental changes by mapping them into hysteron states. Such a system
of bi-stable hysteretic switches can therefore filter environmental history. As we have seen,
self-organization by environmental fluctuations can lead to the emergence of soft-spots,
which, once they have become persistent, can recognize environmental histories, like the
Preisach hysterons.

Hysteron-like behavior is found in metabolic systems where they come in the form of
molecular switches. One well-studied molecular switch with hysteresis is the lac operon ac-
tivation in E. coli (108) (see side bar). | Sugars are the main energy source of bacteria. The
lac operon is a set of genes that when transcribed permits the metabolisation of complex
sugars such as lactose, when the preferred simple sugar glucose is not available. The acti-
vation of the lac operon comes at a cost, since some resources have to be diverted into the
synthesis of proteins necessary to metabolize these complex sugars. Lambert and Kussell
performed experiments revealing HDB and memory formation when £. coli is repeatedly

switched between glucose- and lactose-rich environments (103). It is thus conceivable that
a metabolic system with many interacting hysteretic molecular switches would be capable
to transit between metabolic states in a way that is highly sensitive to certain patterns of
environmental fluctuations, giving thereby rise to complex HDB.

5.4. The role of dimensional reduction in biology and dose-response curves

We have seen how the large configurational degrees of freedom of a system, when subjected
to a one-parameter deformation under athermal quasistatic condition can be represented by
a t-graph. The topology of the t-graph yields a minimal description from which properties
like mechanical reversibility can be retrieved. This is an (extreme) example of dimensional
reduction, where the quantities of interest are captured by a number of degrees of freedom
that is much smaller than the available ones, meaning that many degrees of freedom are
slaved to a few. This is the idea underlying a slow manifold and its soft-modes (29).

In the ¢-graph description, the underlying mesostates are not structureless. Referring
to Fig. 2(a) they represent a collection of microscopic configurations that transform contin-

23
Bistability and hysteresis in gene regulation: the lac operon

Metabolically, bistability (multistability) refers to genetically identical organisms capable of being in two (or
more) distinct states, with the actual state depending on additional factors such as availability of nutrients.
The switch between these states may be hysteretic with a positive feedback loop being often involved. The
lac Operon in E. coli is a classic and well-studied example. The lac Operon controls the transcription of a set
of genes that are necessary for the metabolization of complex sugars such as lactose. By default, transcription
is repressed by a repressor protein encoded elsewhere on the genome. In particular lactose, when present,
will cause deactivation of the repressor so that the genes of the lac operon can be transcribed and lactose
metabolization is activated. Among the proteins synthesized, one of them enhances the deactivation of the
repressor giving rise to a positive feedback loop. The switching of the lac Operon is hysteretic, it becomes
activated when lactose levels are sufficiently large, but will deactivate only if it has fallen below a lactose

level much lower than what was needed for activation (for details see (108, 103, 93)).

uously into each other as a deformation parameter ¢€ is varied. Macroscopic properties such
as the external stress response to an applied strain evolve in a similar continuous manner
within a mesostate, as the response is slaved to the particle configurations. These are the
elastic branches, some of which were depicted in 1(b).

Slow manifolds and their role in biology have been discussed extensively in a recent
review (29). Along the same lines, the importance of dimensional reduction and continuous
responses in biology has been revisited in (107). One of the manifestations of dimensional
reduction in biological modeling are the ubiquitous dose-response (DR) curves. DR-curves
describe the continuous dependence of quantities of interests on a set of control parameters.
They play a role similar to the elastic branches of amorphous solids, which describe the
stress response to strain deformation. DR-curves emerge for example in the description of
metabolic switches (108, 103), but also in models of antibiotic resistance evolution (109),
such as the TIL model (110). The latter model exhibits hysteresis which can be linked to
the Preisach model (72). Moreover, the complex adaptive response to a rapid change of
antibiotic concentrations bears resemblance to stress relaxation in amorphous solids (111).

5.5. Mechanical annealing as evolution in silico

The self-organization of driven disordered systems under mechanical annealing mimics the
evolutionary processes of mutation and selection in changing environments (112, 72, 113).
In the context of annealing a sheared amorphous solid, we can think of the soft-spots as
mutations, while the annealing by an externally applied shear — cyclic or random — emulates
a selection process in which soft-spots are created and destroyed. The self-organization
under annealing is a search for a collection of persistent soft-spots that can be repeatedly
triggered in full or in subsets as the driving cycle or its subcycles are traversed, cf. Fig.
2(d). As we have seen, this is the evolutionary process that leads to the emergence of
mechanical reversibility and memory formation. Can we regard mechanical annealing as
being analogous to evolution, and if so, what insights can such an analogy provide?

The evolution of organisms under mutation and selection is governed by a fitness land-
scape. Fitness is a proxy for the ability of genotypes to grow in an environment with

24 5 WHAT CAN MEMORY AND SELF-ORGANIZATION IN DRIVEN DISORDERED SYSTEMS TEACH US ABOUT HO
evolution selecting for higher fitness and organisms evolving towards peaks of the landscape
(114, 115, 116, 117). A candidate for fitness in the case of the sheared amorphous solid is
the gain in elasticity as a result of reduction of energy dissipation, and hence diminishing of
plastic activity under mechanical annealing (17). The self-organization of the amorphous
solid under deformations, can then be regarded as that of a population of soft-spots that
evolves by selection and mutation, according to some appropriately defined fitness.

The aforementioned work by Tagkopolous et al. (24) on the anticipatory metabolic
switch in £. coli under temperature changes provides an example where this connection
is explored in the other direction. The authors also simulate the evolution of biochemical
networks whose properties changes according to empirically-motivated update rules and
depending on the availability of fluctuating environmental resources. They find that antici-
patory behavior can be learned and subsequently forgotten under changes of environmental
conditions. Analogies between the evolution of the biochemical networks and disordered
solids under fluctuating environments are at hand. Mesoscale models of disordered solids,
such as the QMEP model considered here, constitute attractive minimal models with a
dynamic disorder landscape where such connections can be explored in further detail.

6. OUTLOOK

The following quote from Libchaber and Tlusty (21) describes well what may lie ahead of
us: By construction, the memory cascade model embraces an “evolutionary ergodic princi-
ple” (or evolutionary Occam’s razor): Every feasible mechanism that is not forbidden by
hard physical constraints will eventually be explored by evolution. In this review, we have
given an exposition of how physical systems with multi-stability and hysteresis respond to
external stimuli and encode that history into their internal state. We propose here that such
self-organization, coming ”for free” as it were, offers the possibility of facile pathways for
evolvability and constitutes an appealing paradigm for understanding how biological organ-
isms may sense and adapt to fluctuating environments. Pursuing analogies with physical
systems capable of forming memories offers an exciting approach to comprehending the
organization and evolution of simple enough biological systems.
