Abstract. Expansion history of the Universe, prior to the onset of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN),
remains largely unknown. The high-energy post-inflationary era is, in general, expected to be
complex, potentially consisting of multiple distinct epochs, each characterized by a distinct equation
of state (EoS). One of the robust predictions of the inflationary paradigm is the generation of
tensor perturbations through quantum fluctuations, which later manifest as a stochastic background
of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). The large-scale amplitude and small-scale spectral tilt
(new) of inflationary GWs encode information about the energy scale of inflation, and provide
an important observational probe of the post-inflationary (pre-BBN) dynamics, respectively. In
particular, a softer post-inflationary EoS (w < 1/3) leads to red-tilted GW spectrum (ngw < 0),
whereas stiffer EoS (w > 1/3) produces blue tilt (ng@w > 0).

In the previous work [1], we developed an analytical framework for computing the spectral
energy density of these first-order GWs for scenarios involving multiple sharp (instantaneous) tran-
sitions in the post-inflationary EoS, w; > we +> Wp > Wn41 = 1/3. We primarily focused on
determining the parameter space which leads to GW signals that may be detectable by future GW
observatories.

In this companion paper, we extend the framework of Ref. [1] to systematically explore the
rich landscape of possible inflationary GW spectra imprinted by multiple (n >> 1) post-inflationary
epochs prior to the hot Big Bang. Remaining agnostic to specific models, we demonstrate that a
diverse morphological zoo of spectral shapes—ranging from convex and concave monotonic profiles
to highly non-monotonic features—can emerge depending on the sequence and duration of epochs.
We introduce GWInSpect €) — a Python-based, user-friendly package that efficiently generates in-
flationary GW spectra for arbitrary post-inflationary histories, enabling a systematic study of the
post-inflationary expansion history.

1 Introduction

Cosmic inflation [2-15] is the leading paradigm for providing initial conditions for the hot Big Bang
phase [7, 16-18]. In its simplest realization, inflation is driven by a scalar field ¢, the inflaton,
which is minimally coupled to gravity, and slowly rolls down its potential V(¢) [7, 9, 10, 15].
Quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field give rise to a nearly scale-invariant spectrum of scalar
perturbations [19-22], whose imprints on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) [23-26] and the
large-scale structure [17, 27, 28] strongly support the single-field slow-roll inflationary framework.

Alongside scalar perturbations, inflation also generates tensor quantum fluctuations, which
constitute a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs) [29-32]. Their spectral
energy density (Qgw) on large cosmological scales contains information about the energy scale of
inflation [1, 30, 31, 33-35], while its spectral tilt (ngw), particularly on small scales, is sensitive
to the post-inflationary equation of state (EoS), w, of the early Universe [1, 31]. To be precise, a
softer EoS, with w < 1/3, results in a red tilt, while a stiffer EoS, with w > 1/3, leads to blue-tilted
GWs, which are of great phenomenological interest from an observational prospect. Consequently,
the inflationary GW spectrum offers a unique window into the expansion history of the Universe
between the end of inflation and the onset of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) -—which remains
observationally unconstrained at present [1, 15, 36-39].

A broad network of GW detectors, operating across frequencies from 10~!8 Hz to 10° Hz, is
now capable of probing this primordial signal. These include CMB B-mode experiments such as
BICEP/Keck [40], LiteBIRD [41], and the Simons Observatory [42]; pulsar timing arrays (PTAs)
such as NANOGrav [43, 44], EPTA/InPTA [45, 46], and IPTA [47]; and laser interferometers such as
LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA [48-50] and future missions including LISA [51], DECIGO [52], BBO [53], Cosmic

Explorer [54], and the Einstein Telescope [55]. These facilities together span a significant fre-
quency range of inflationary tensor modes.

The post-inflationary Universe is expected to have undergone a complex sequence of phases and
non-equilibrium processes before reaching the radiation-dominated phase [56-59] prior to the com-
mencement of BBN. The dynamics of reheating and subsequent transitions can, therefore, involve
several distinct epochs [35, 60-63], each characterized by a different effective EoS, w;. Most works in
the literature have typically assumed a single average EoS during reheating [64-67]. In our previous
work [1], we developed an analytical framework based on Israel junction-matching conditions [31,
68, 69] to compute the spectrum of the first-order inflationary GWs for multiple (n-number of)
sharp (instantaneous) transitions in the post-inflationary EoS, w; > w2 > ++: > wp, > 1/3. We
primarily focused on identifying the parameter space of post-inflationary EoS and transition energy
scales, {w;, E;}, that leads to the spectra of inflationary GWs which are consistent with the exist-
ing constraints from aLIGO and BBN, while being potentially detectable by future observatories. In
fact, Ref. [1] dealt with up to 4 different post-inflationary epochs before the hot Big Bang.

In this companion paper, we utilise the framework developed in Ref. [1] to systematically
characterise the morphological zoo of inflationary GW spectra emerging from a large number of
sequential post-inflationary epochs (n © 10). We remain agnostic about the specific model details,
and allow the EoS of any epoch to lie in the range w; € (—1/3, 1). We demonstrate that a
remarkably diverse range of spectral shapes— convex, concave, monotonic, and non-monotonic ~—can
arise purely from the sequence and duration of these epochs. We further develop a simple and
user-friendly Python-based numerical toolkit, called GWInSpect (GitHub link ©) that facilitates
the interested users to generate such spectra for arbitrary post-inflationary histories within this
general framework. In fact, one of the key objectives of this work is to highlight the efficiency
of GWInSpect toolkit. With a simple interface and fast performance, it enables the exploration
of complex sequences of epochs with minimal effort, making it ideal for large parameter scans or
integration into broader cosmological analyses. By providing this tool publicly, we positively aim to
encourage its widespread use for systematically investigating the imprints of diverse post-inflationary
scenarios on the gravitational wave background.

To be precise, the present paper is differs from our previous work in Ref. [1] in the following
distinct ways :

e The previous work in Ref. [1] presented a comprehensive analytical and numerical framework
for computing the spectral energy density of inflationary GWs, corresponding to multiple
post-inflationary epochs in the early Universe. The primary goal was to determine the viable
parameter space of the post-inflationary Universe —in particular, the equation-of-state param-
eters and the energy scales of successive transition epochs that could yield an observable GW

signal in upcoming and future detectors, while remaining consistent with existing constraints
from BBN and aLIGO.

In the present work, we instead utilise the analytical formalism developed in Ref. [1] to system-
atically categorise the wide variety of inflationary GW spectra that can emerge from multiple
EoS transitions. While all our results respect the BBN constraints, we do not focus here on
detectability forecasts or comparison with experimental sensitivities. In contrast, the present

paper adopts a narrower focus, emphasizing the diversity of possible spectral shapes arising
from multiple post-inflationary epochs. Since our analytical approach relies on the instan-
taneous transition approximation between successive epochs, each post-inflationary phase is
required to last at least one e-fold for a reliable estimate of the GW spectrum.

e Ref. [1] applied the formalism to model-agnostic post-inflationary histories, as well as to a
specific string theory inspired scenario. The current work, on the other hand, is fully model-
independent and aims to illustrate the generic features of the inflationary GW spectrum
without reference to any particular particle-physics model.

e Building upon the numerical infrastructure developed previously, we introduce a dedicatec
numerical toolkit, GWInSpect, which efficiently computes the inflationary GW spectrum for
arbitrary sequences of post-inflationary epochs characterized by multiple EoS parameters {w;}.
The code allows the user to generate spectra across a wide frequency range within a shor
runtime.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we summarize the relevant analytical expressions
for the tensor mode functions in the post-inflationary epochs, and the corresponding GW spectra.
energy density, using the junction matching formalism discussed in Ref. [1]. In Sec. 3, we present
the wide variety of possible spectral shapes of inflationary GWs corresponding to different post-
inflationary expansion histories. Sec. 4 describes our lightweight Python-based numerical toolkit,
GWInSpect, for computing these spectra efficiently. Finally, Sec. 5 summarizes our main conclusions

and provides further discussion.

2 Inflationary gravitational waves

The accelerated expansion of space during inflation leads to the amplification of vacuum tensor
fluctuations [29], which are stretched to super-Hubble scales [30], where they remain effectively
frozen until their subsequent Hubble re-entry in the post-inflationary (decelerating) Universe. Once
these tensor modes re-enter the Hubble radius, they begin to oscillate and propagate as primordial
GWs. Modes with higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) re-enter the Hubble radius at earlier
times after inflation, whereas modes with lower frequencies (longer wavelengths) re-enter at later
epochs. Having been generated during inflation, the tensor modes propagate largely unimpeded
to the present epoch, thereby retaining key imprints of the intermediate expansion history of the
Universe. In particular, the high-frequency regime of the spectrum, corresponding to present-day
requencies f >> 10~!° Hz, encodes valuable information about the unknown pre-BBN evolution of
he Universe (see Sec. 2.2), as discussed in Refs. [1, 31, 65]. In what follows, we summarise the
essential analytical framework required for computing the spectral energy density of inflationary
GWs, restricting ourselves to those expressions most relevant for the present study. A detailed
reatment of the same can be found in our previous work [1].

2.1 Evolution of tensor mode functions through multiple post-inflationary epochs

Evolution of the Fourier mode functions of primordial tensor fluctuations generated by inflation, at
inear order in perturbation theory, is governed by the following second-order differential equation

if
hyo +2 (*) Ap +k? hs =0, (2.1)
a

where ha is the tensor amplitude, with A = {+, x} denoting the two polarisation of GWs and k is

the comoving wavenumber of the tensor modes. General solution to Eq. (2.1) can be written as a

linear combination of two Bessel functions of the first kind [70], namely, {oa 1 )@), F(a 1) (x)},

as follows -

A = P
he (Uy) = (a wea Ee Ja) (0 Y,) + Be J(q1)( ws) , (2.2)
where a is related to the EoS (w), while y,(r) is the physical frequency (k/a(r)) of the tensor
modes—scaled by the Hubble parameter (H(r)), of the post-inflationary Universe, i.e.,

2 k
~T$3w' (7) = a(t)H(r)

(2.3)

The Bogolyubov coefficients, {A;,, B;,}, are determined by imposing the appropriate initial or bound-
ary conditions on the tensor mode functions. For the first post-inflationary epoch, characterised by
a constant EoS (wi), these coefficients are obtained by matching to the inflationary tensor modes
at the end of inflation. Specifically, the super-Hubble inflationary tensor perturbations serve as
the initial conditions for the subsequent evolution in this epoch. Consequently, for any mode with
comoving wavenumber k that was super-Hubble at the onset of the first epoch, the initial tensor
mode function is taken to be equal to the frozen amplitude of the corresponding inflationary mode,
while its time derivative vanishes, namely,

hi (tr) = hy inf 3 Ap (rr) =O, (2.4

where 7; marks the post-inflationary Hubble-entry time of a tensor mode of interest with (comoving
wavenumber k. Eq. (2.4) yields the following expression for the Bogolyubov coefficients for the firs
epoch (see Ref [1])

Ap 1= g(o1-3) T (a af 5) he ints Bra = 0, (2.5

where I(x) is the Gamma function.

As emphasized earlier, the high-energy post-inflationary dynamics of the Universe is expectec
to involve a variety of complex physical processes, potentially giving rise to multiple distinct expan-
sion phases before the onset of BBN. It is therefore instructive to model the pre-BBN expansion
history as a sequence of successive cosmic epochs, each characterised by a (nearly) constant EoS
parameter [1, 71, 72], as illustrated in Fig. 1. We denote this sequence of post-inflationary EoS
parameters by wi, we, ..-, Wn, Wn41 = 1/3, where wn+1 is the EoS of the radiation-dominated hot
Big Bang phase.

In addition, by assuming that the transition between any two successive epochs is sufficiently
sharp, t.e., effectively instantaneous, one can employ the Israel junction conditions [68] to relate

It is important to emphasize that the analytical formalism employed in this work, based on
the aforementioned usage of instantaneous transitions and Israel junction matching conditions, is
reliable only when each post-inflationary epoch persists for a minimum duration of at least one
e-fold. This requirement ensures that the background dynamics within each constant w; phase can
be treated as quasi-stationary, thereby preserving the adiabatic evolution of tensor modes across
transitions. If an epoch were to last for a substantially shorter duration, the assumption of a
well-defined constant EoS would break down, and the discontinuous matching conditions would no
longer provide a reliable description of the gravitational wave dynamics. In practice, this consistency
condition has been incorporated within our numerical framework, GWInSpect, discussed in Sec. 4.

2.2 Spectral energy density and present-epoch frequency of inflationary GWs

The spectral energy density of the gravitational waves is a measure of the GW energy density per
logarithm interval of frequency [73, 74], defined as,

where pay is the energy density of GWs and p,(T) = 3m, H?(r) is the critical energy density. In
the sub-Hubble regime~— when a tensor mode is sufficiently inside the Hubble radius ~— expression for
the GW spectral energy density becomes [1]

where Pp(t,k) = 2k? |hy|?/(277) is the total tensor power spectrum (including both polarization
states) at conformal time +. By evolving the tensor modes to the present epoch and considering
the sub-Hubble regime, one can compute the tensor power spectrum today and thereby obtain the
present-day spectral energy density of GWs, which, when averaged over the oscillations of individual
modes, takes the following form

tributing to the energy and entropy densities of the Universe; Qyaq,9 is the present-epoch radiation

pivot scale, r. denotes the beginning of hot Big Bang, and finally, y,., = k/ (@eqHeq), with the
subscript “eq” referring to the epoch of matter—radiation equality. The re-scaled Bogolyubov coeffi-
cients corresponding to the standard matter-dominated epoch are defined as Arp = Apmp/ Ae int

and Bri = Bi/Pf ine:

Eq. (2.15) can be conveniently re-expressed in terms of the present-day GW frequency, which
is a directly measurable quantity in GW observations. Since the primordial tensor spectral index is
constrained to be very small (|n,,| < 1), its effect on the overall amplitude and tilt of the spectrum is
negligible compared to that arising from the post-inflationary dynamics. Therefore, we set n,. = 0
throughout this analysis in order to isolate and highlight the imprints of the pre-hot Big Bang
expansion history on the morphology of the GW spectral energy density. The resulting expression
for the present-day spectral energy density of inflationary GWs, written as a function of the GW
frequency, takes the following form [1]

3 The morphological zoo of inflationary gravitational wave spectra

In this section, we undertake a detailed investigation into the diverse shapes that the inflationary
GW spectrum can exhibit as a consequence of different post-inflationary (pre-BBN) expansion
histories of the Universe. As emphasised above, the evolution of tensor modes across successive
epochs, each characterized by a distinct EoS parameter w;, imprints a rich structure on the spectral
energy density ag ) (f). Depending on the sequence, duration, and relative energy scales of these
epochs, the resulting spectra can display a wide range of morphologies—including monotonic (blue-
or red-tilted), convex, concave, as well as non-monotonic or multi-peaked behaviours.

Our goal here is to systematically map this zoo of inflationary GW spectra in a model-agnostic
manner, relying solely on the macroscopic post-inflationary dynamics encapsulated by the EoS
parameters {w;} and the transition scales {E;}. By varying these parameters within the framework
established in Sec. 2, we illustrate how even simple sequences of instantaneous transitions can give
rise to remarkably distinct spectral features. Such an analysis not only highlights the sensitivity of
a, ( f) to the early expansion history, but also provides valuable intuition for interpreting future
detections of a stochastic GW background in terms of the underlying kinematics of cosmic evolution.

To be precise, different shapes of the GW spectra correspond to the following sequence of the
post-inflationary expansion history

1. The spectrum is monotonic when either w; > 1/3 (blue-tilted) or w; < 1/3 (red-tilted) for all
pre-hot Big Bang epochs 7.

2. A monotonic spectrum is convex when wi > w2 > w3-+: > Wn, while it is concave when
wy < we < w3-+: < Wn. In the absence of a strict ordering among the EoS parameters,
the resulting monotonic spectrum ceases to exhibit a definite curvature and becomes neither
convex nor concave.

3. Non-monotonic behaviour with peaks and/or troughs appear when some of the EoS parameters
obey w; > 1/3, while others obey w; < 1/3.

A schematic illustration of representative spectral morphologies is shown in Fig. 2, where the
spectral energy density a ( f) is plotted as a function of the present-day GW frequency f. The
grey-shaded regions indicate approximate detector sensitivity regions (Planck CMB, LISA, aLIGO)
and the horizontal dashed line (with reddish shade) schematically marks the BBN constraint. We
do not display sensitivity regions of other GW detectors, which were displayed in Ref. [1]. We
adhere to the following conventions in all our GW spectral energy density plots

1. The present-day spectral energy density of inflationary GWs, ay f), is plotted as a function
of the present-day frequency f, with both axes in logarithmic scale, as is customary in the
literature.
2. The tensor-to-scalar ratio during inflation is fixed at r = 0.001, which corresponds to an
inflationary energy scale of Ejyp ~ 5.8 x 10!° GeV (see App. A.2 of Ref. [1]).

3. The present-day frequency of the tensor mode that re-entered the Hubble radius at the end
of inflation can be obtained using Eq. (2.18) as feng & 6.4 x 10’ Hz. We consider this value
as the absolute upper limit (UV cut-off) on the GW frequency in all our plots. The lower
frequency limit (IR cut-off) is set at fiz ~ 2x 10-79 Hz, corresponding to modes that re-enter
the Hubble radius just prior to the onset of the dark energy-dominated accelerated expansion
of the Universe.

4. Frequencies corresponding to the transition between successive cosmic epochs are indicated
by thin vertical grey lines in all the plots.

duced by a decreasing (increasing) sequence of EoS parameters w, > wa > +--+ > Wp (for concave

trated by the green curve for a single peak and the purple curve for two peaks (and a dip). The
solid (dashed) orange curve corresponds to monotonically increasing (decreasing) spectrum which
is neither convex nor concave. The solid black curve illustrates an approximately scale-invariant
spectrum corresponding to a radiation-like EoS w = 1/3. The grey-shaded regions indicate the ap-
proximate sensitivities of space-based detectors (LISA) and ground-based interferometers (aLIGO),
while the red-shaded region marks the BBN constraint. The figure serves to highlight the broad va-
riety of inflationary GW spectral shapes possible for different post-inflationary expansion histories.

3.1 Scenarios with monotonic spectra of inflationary gravitational waves

Monotonic spectra of inflationary GWs arise when the sequence of post-inflationary equation-of-
state parameters, starting from the first epoch after inflation, evolves to the final epoch prior to the
hot Big Bang phase, by remaining either stiffer (w; > 1/3) or softer (w; < 1/3) than a radiation-
like EoS w = 1/3. A sequence of stiffer-than-radiation EoS parameters leads to blue-tilted GW
spectrum, while a softer-than-radiation sequence leads to red-tilted GW spectrum, as mentioned
before. The commonly assumed scenario of a single constant EoS during the entire post-inflationary
evolution is a particular case within this category.

An increasing sequence of EoS parameters, 7.e., wy < wa < ++: < Wp, results in a concave-
shaped monotonic spectrum of GWs. Conversely, a decreasing sequence, wy > w2 > --- > Wn,
leads to a progressively softer background and produces a convex-shaped spectrum. Of particular
significance are the blue-tilted spectra of GWs (which may be convex or concave or neither) that
arise, when w > 1/3. From a phenomenological standpoint, as it enhances the GW amplitude
at higher frequencies, potentially bringing the signal within the sensitivity range of current and
upcoming detectors [31, 37, 65], as also discussed extensively in our previous work [1].

3.1.1 Blue-tilted inflationary GWs with convex-shaped spectra

A convex-shaped, monotonically increasing spectrum of inflationary GWs arises when the post-
inflationary epochs are characterized by a sequence of progressively softer equations of state, w1 >
w2 > w3 >... > Wrad = 1/3. In such scenarios, the spectral energy density aif) grows with
frequency (ngyw(f) > 0), and the rate of growth also gradually increases, i.e., [d/(dIn f)] naw (f) >
0, producing a convex curvature in the log Maw — log f plane. This behaviour typically originates
from the diminishing amplification of the tensor modes as the expansion history transitions from
a stiffer to a softer EoS regime. The highest blue tilt results from the first post-inflationary epoch
with the stiffest EoS, while the convexity encodes the hierarchical duration and energy scales of the
subsequent, softer epochs. A representative class of convex-shaped blue-tilted GW spectra is shown
in Fig. 3.

Such convex monotonic spectra are particularly relevant for phenomenological studies, since
they can feature a gradual spectral saturation within the frequency bands probed by future space-

based interferometers such as LISA, BBO, and DECIGO, with the caveat that a substantial growth of
, , ,
al ( f) at higher frequencies might lead to a violation of the BBN constraint (2.21).

3.1.2 Blue-tilted inflationary GWs with concave-shaped spectra

A concave-shaped, monotonically increasing spectrum of inflationary GWs typically results from
a post-inflationary expansion history governed by a sequence of increasingly stiffer equations of
state, wi < wo <_w3 <...< wn. In this case, the spectral energy density AQ (A) increases with
frequency, exhibiting an overall blue tilt (ngy(f) > 0). However, slope of the spectrum gradually
decreases, i.e., [d/(dln f)|ngw(f) < 0, leading to a concave curvature in the log Qgw —log f
plane. A representative class of concave-shaped blue-tilted GW spectra is shown in Fig. 4. Such
a spectral shape encodes the gradual hardening of the background EoS — undergoing an ordered
sequence of transitions from softer to stiffer dynamics prior to the onset of radiation domination.
They also possess a clear phenomenological advantage: their concave shape enables the spectrum to
enter the sensitivity bands of space-based (and forthcoming ground-based) detectors at intermediate

frequencies, while remaining consistent with the BBN bound due to the gradual flattening of a( f)
at higher frequencies.

3.2. Scenarios with non-monotonic spectra of inflationary gravitational waves

In the previous subsection, we focused on monotonically increasing classes of inflationary GW spec-
tra arising from post-inflationary expansion histories characterised by an ordered either steadily
increasing or decreasing — sequence of EoS parameters. In contrast, in the absence of such an ordered
sequence of {w;}, we generically expect non-monotonic features in log a&( f)—log f plane.

Such scenarios typically occur when the post-inflationary universe experiences alternating
epochs of softer and stiffer equations of state prior to the commencement of the hot Big Bang
phase. A gradual transition from softer/stiffer epochs to stiffer/softer epochs imprints a local fea-
ure—such as a peak (bump) or a trough (dip)—in the spectral slope of a( f). The resulting
spectra can thus exhibit multiple turning points, corresponding to characteristic frequencies at
which the horizon re-entry of tensor modes coincides with the transition between successive EoS
phases. This stands in contrast to the conventional expectation in the literature that inflationary
gravitational waves yield strictly monotonic spectra.

In this subsection, we illustrate representative examples of non-monotonic spectra of infla-
ionary GWs, highlighting the variety of shapes that may arise from different sequences of post-
inflationary EoS parameters. For concreteness, we restrict our analysis to spectra exhibiting up to
wo distinct peaks in a f), as these already encompass the essential phenomenology associated
with multiple transitions in the equation of state. However, the underlying formalism developed
in our previous work [1] and employed here is fully general, and allows the user to construct GW
spectra with an arbitrary number of transitions and spectral features'!. The shapes discussed be-
low therefore serve as templates for understanding how alternating soft and stiff epochs in the

post-inflationary history can lead to a rich variety of GW morphologies.

3.2.1 Non-monotonic spectra for a soft EoS immediately after inflation

A non-monotonic spectrum can arise when the post-inflationary universe begins with a relatively
soft EoS (w; < 1/3) before transitioning to stiffer or radiation-like epochs. In this case, the early
suppression of tensor modes re-entering during the soft phase results in an initial red tilt of a ( f)
at high frequencies. Subsequent transitions to larger values of w; enhance the spectral slope, pro-
ducing a local maximum (or bump) at an intermediate frequency corresponding to the scale that
re-enters near such transitions. The resulting spectrum therefore exhibits a single or double-peaked

profile depending on the number and duration of the subsequent stiff epochs.

lwith the caveat that each epoch must last for at least one e-fold in order for our analytical approach to remain
valid, as discussed in Secs. 2.1 and 4.2.

spectra with peak(s), arising when the post-inflationary universe begins with a softer EoS (wi <
1/3), but later evolves to become stiffer (w > 1/3) at some epoch. The top row contains 5
different post-inflationary epochs, while the bottom row contains 10 epochs. The left column
corresponds to an energy scale of E;, = 1GeV at the beginning of hot Big Bang, while the right
column corresponds to E,, = 100 GeV. Transitions between successive epochs are marked by grey
vertical lines. The BBN constraint is illustrated by the red-shaded region, and the sensitivity curves
for LISA, Planck, and aLIGO are displayed by grey-shaded regions. [None of the curves violate the
existing constraints from BBN and aLIG0.]

Physically, this behaviour reflects the temporary dilution of GW energy density during the
soft phase(s), followed by a relative amplification in the stiff epoch(s). A representative class of
non-monotonic GW spectra with w; < 1/3 is shown in Fig. 5.

3.2.2 Non-monotonic spectra for a stiff EoS immediately after inflation

Conversely, if the universe initially enters a stiff post-inflationary epoch (w; > 1/3), including a
brief kination phase, the corresponding GW spectrum exhibits an opposite sequence of features.
The early blue tilt, generated by the rapid dilution of the background energy density during the
stiff epoch, enhances 0 ( f) at high frequencies, which is associated with modes making an early
horizon re-entry.

When the universe subsequently transitions to a softer phase (wes yv< w}), the spectral slope
decreases, producing a turnover that manifests as a suppression, some times as a trough (or dip)
at intermediate frequencies. This generates a non-monotonic structure characterised by one or
more peaks depending on the number of alternating stiff-soft transitions. A representative class of
non-monotonic GW spectra with w; > 1/3 is shown in Fig. 6.

Primordial GWs with both the aforementioned types of non-monotonic spectra, with one or
more peaks, are particularly interesting from a phenomenological perspective, since they can yield
enhanced power in frequency bands accessible to space-based and/or ground-based GW detectors,
while still remaining consistent with the BBN constraints.

4 GWInSpect: Python-based numerical package

4.1 Overview

GWInSpect © is a Python-based numerical framework designed to compute the present-day spectral
energy density of inflationary gravitational waves, a f), for a user-specified post-inflationary
expansion history consisting of multiple epochs with instantaneous transitions. Each epoch is char-
acterized by a constant equation-of-state parameter, and the code implements the junction matching
conditions described in Ref. [1] to evolve the tensor modes across successive epochs.

The package is lightweight, modular, and written for both exploratory and precision studies

of the inflationary GW background. It employs the following major libraries:

4.2 Required inputs
The following inputs are required to run GWInSpect. Unless otherwise stated, any input lying
outside the specified range is automatically rejected with a descriptive message.

e List of EoS parameters: {wi,w2,...,wn}, ordered from the earliest to the latest post-

inflationary epoch, satisfying —0.28 < w; < 1.

e Transition energies: An ascending list {E,_1,...,E,} in GeV, defining the boundaries
between epochs (latest — earliest). The typical range is 107? GeV < E; < 10'©GeV. The
terminal hot Big Bang energy scale E,, is not included in this list.

e Commencement of hot Big Bang: Either specify the hot Big Bang temperature T,,. >
10-3 GeV (consistent with BBN constraints) or the corresponding energy scale E;, which the
code internally maps to T;«.

e Inflationary scale: Specify either the tensor-to-scalar ratio r (restricted to r < 0.036) or the
corresponding energy scale of inflation, Ein < 1.4 x 10! GeV.

Duration of each epoch.

To maintain the validity of the instantaneous-transition approximation discussed in Sec. 2.1,
GWInSpect enforces that every post-inflationary epoch must span at least one e-fold. The num-
ber of e-folds in the i** epoch is defined as

4 Ey_-1 .
AN: 301 +m) in( E, ) >1 Vie {1,2,---,n} (4.1)

If AN; < 1 for any epoch, the code halts execution and prompts the user to revise the duration
(energy hierarchy) or the EoS parameters of the input sequence. For transparency, the complete
array {AN;} can also be given as one of the output for user inspection.

4.3 Typical outputs
GWInSpect produces the following key outputs:

e A log-spaced frequency array covering the range from the infrared cut-off to the UV cut-off,
Le. fir to fena-

e The corresponding present-day spectral energy density array, A ( f).

e A list of present-day frequencies corresponding to the Hubble re-entry times of the tensor
modes at each instantaneous transition (including feng as the first entry) (optional).

e A list of the number of e-folds {A.N;} associated with each post-inflationary epoch (optional).

Together, these outputs enable the user to reconstruct the full morphology of the inflationary GW
spectra and study its dependence on the hitherto unknown expansion history of the early Universe ?.

5 Discussion and Outlook

In this work, employing the analytical framework developed in our previous paper [1] for computing
the present-day spectral energy density of first-order inflationary GWs, a (f), we carried out a
systematic investigation of their spectral shapes. A key methodological distinction of this work is its
focus on the morphological diversity of the inflationary GW spectra, including monotonic (red-tilted
or blue-tilted, convex or concave) and non-monotonic (single-peaked or multi-peaked) forms, rather
than on detection prospects or parameter constraints, which were the main objectives of Ref. [1].
These distinct morphologies naturally emerge from different combinations of cosmic epochs,
with soft and stiff post-inflationary EoS parameters, preceding the onset of the hot Big Bang phase.
The analytical formalism developed in [1], employing Israel junction conditions and the Heaviside

representation of sharp transitions, is directly applied here to study the possible shapes of aA( f)
across multiple post-inflationary epochs. Apart from the BBN constraints on GWs, we enforce the
condition that each post-inflationary epoch lasts at least one e-fold, thereby preserving the validity
of the instantaneous-transition approximation underlying our analytical approach. Our analysis
remains entirely model-agnostic, relying only on the sequence of EoS parameters without invoking
any specific microphysical or particle-physics realization.

A complementary aim of this study is the development of a practical, user-friendly numeri-

cal package, GWInSpect, which automates the computation of 2( f) for arbitrary sequences of

?We also make available a list of useful additional functions within this package, such as the ones to check the
BBN constraint using Eq. (2.21) and to relate different early Universe quantities at a certain epoch, amongst others.

the post-inflationary EoS parameters and the corresponding transition energy scales. The publicly
available code provides a fast and flexible tool for generating GW spectra corresponding to a wide
range of post-inflationary histories. In this way, GWInSpect bridges the analytical formalism of [1]
with numerical implementation, enabling efficient exploration of early-Universe reheating scenarios.
Together, these two studies provide a simple computational framework for probing the unknown his-
tory of the early Universe through the imprints of its post-inflationary dynamics on the inflationary
GW background.

Looking ahead, there exist several promising directions in which the present framework can be
extended and refined.

e As in our previous work, the analytical framework developed across these two studies can
be readily employed for model-dependent analyses, enabling one to constrain the underlying
physical parameters of specific post-inflationary scenarios [78] in light of present and future
GW observational prospects.

e By relaxing the requirement that each post-inflationary epoch must last at least one e-fold,
through the incorporation of smooth transitions (implemented via suitable functional forms)
between successive epochs, one can achieve a more realistic and fine-grained characterization
of the underlying cosmological dynamics.

e A long-term goal is to extend the present formalism to study the impact of multiple post-
inflationary transitions on the spectra of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) [73,
79-81]. Since such second-order GWs depend greatly on the background expansion history,
the analytical and numerical techniques developed here can offer valuable insights into their
spectral structure.
