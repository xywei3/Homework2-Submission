ABSTRACT

Several centimeters below the skin lie multiple biomarkers,
such as glucose, oxygenation, and blood flow. Monitoring
these biomarkers regularly and in a non-invasive manner
would enable early insight into metabolic status and vascular
health. Currently, there are only a handful of non-invasive
monitoring systems. Optical methods offer molecular speci-
ficity (i.e., multi-biomarker monitoring) but have shallow
reach (a few millimeters); ultrasound penetrates deeper but
lacks specificity; and MRI is large, slow, and costly. Photoa-
coustic (PA) sensing combines the best of optical and ultra-
sound methods. A laser transmitter emits pulses that are
absorbed by different molecules, providing specificity. These
light pulses generate pressure changes that are captured
by an ultrasound receiver, providing depth. Photoacoustic
sensing is promising, but the current platforms are bulky,
complex, and costly. We propose the first embedded PA plat-
form. Our contributions are fourfold. First, inspired by LIDAR
technology, we propose a novel transmitter that emits pulses
similar to those in the state-of-the-art (SoA), but instead of
using high-voltage sources and complex electronic interfaces,
we use a simple low-power microcontroller (MCU). Second,
we carry out a thorough analysis of our custom transmitter
and a commercial system. Third, we build a basic ultrasound
receiver that is able to process the faint signal generated by
our transmitter. Lastly, we compare the performance of our
platform against a SoA commercial system, and show that we
can detect glucose and (de)oxygenated hemoglobin in two
controlled solution studies. The resulting signal characteris-
tics indicate a plausible path toward noninvasive, real-time,
at-home sensing relevant to diabetes care. More broadly, this
platform lays the groundwork for translating the promise of
PA sensing into a broader practical reality.

would allow measuring multiple biomarkers simultaneously,
such as glucose, oxygen saturation, and blood flow. Real-
time measurements of these biomarkers could reveal subtle
physiological changes in the body long before they are visi-
ble clinically, allowing new potentials in monitoring health,
treatment efficacy, and recovery [6, 22, 31, 47]. This capabil-
ity remains out of reach for existing sensing technologies,
such as MRI and ultrasound, but it is exactly the type of
opportunity that photoacoustic (PA) sensing makes possible.
Beyond human health, PA sensing also has applications in ar-
eas such as environmental monitoring, food quality control,
and material analysis [7, 13, 26, 34, 38, 42].

Compared to technologies that use a single physical sig-
nal for monitoring, such as sound, light, or magnetic fields,
PA uniquely combines the strength of two physical signals:
sound and light, as illustrated in Figure 1. In the first stage,
short pulses of laser light are sent into the target sample.
When the molecules absorb the laser energy, the medium
around them undergoes a rapid thermal expansion. Dur-
ing the “off” period between pulses, the tissue releases that
energy as low-amplitude compressional waves that can be
detected with ultrasound sensors.

PA sensing offers advantages over other techniques. Purely
optical methods can identify molecules but are limited to
shallow depths (1 mm to 2 mm compared to up to 5 cm in PA
[24]). Ultrasound can reach deeper but sees only structure
and is sensitive to mechanical variations, which leads to weak
specificity in biological tissues. Large systems like MRI can
provide detailed anatomy, but they are slow and expensive,
and cannot directly track molecular or functional parameters
at the fine-scale PA can. Furthermore, MRI is not sensitive to
endogenous molecules such as hemoglobin without external
contrast agents.

In PA sensing, the signal strength is proportional to the
concentration of target molecules. The more molecules that
absorb the light, the stronger the resulting ultrasound sig-
nal. This quantitative link between molecular concentration
and acoustic response enables not only the identification

of biomarkers but also the estimation of their concentra-
tion. The ability to combine depth, specificity, and real-time
measurement opens opportunities far beyond current de-
vices, from biomedical monitoring to applications in materi-
als inspection, food quality assessment, and environmental
sensing.

Current commercial PA systems hold broad promise across
many fields, but their use is still largely confined to research
settings. They are bulky and non-portable, relying on high-
power lasers that require advanced cooling and strict safety
protocols. Furthermore, the systems require high sampling
rates, long acquisition times, and intensive computational
processing. These limitations in size, complexity, and opera-
tion have so far kept PA out of field-deployable devices.

In this work, we take the first step toward breaking these
barriers. We leverage advances made by LiDAR technology in
compact, low-cost pulsed lasers to demonstrate core PA sens-
ing functionality in a smaller and more practical form. Our
design includes a novel transmitter, receiver, benchmarking
against commercial systems, and a preliminary evaluation.
In particular, our contribution is fourfold.

Contribution 1 [Section 3] Demonstrating the feasibil-
ity of an embedded PA transmitter: One of the central un-
knowns in bringing PA into embedded systems is whether a
low-power, compact transmitter can generate signals strong
enough to be detected. We design and implement a novel em-
bedded PA transmitter board that integrates low-cost laser
diodes with an efficient driver and control managed by a
small on-board microcontroller.

Contribution 2 [Section 4]: Comparative analysis with
a commercial PA system. We characterize the output of our
transmitter and show that, despite having significantly lower
pulse energy than lab-scale systems, the transmitter can still
produce measurable signals comparable to commercial sys-
tems. To understand the practical trade-offs between embed-
ded and commercial PA systems, we perform side-by-side
measurements in a controlled water tank environment.

Contribution 3 [Section 5]: Embedded PA receiver with
on-board processing. We design a compact receiver board

with integrated amplification, filtering, digitization, and on-
board processing on an FPGA. This removes the need for
bulky, external data acquisition systems and demonstrates
that PA signal capture and initial processing can be achieved
within the constraints of an embedded platform.

Contribution 4 [Section 6 ]: Proof-of-principle biomarker
detection. We validate our system by detecting two repre-
sentative biomarkers, glucose concentration and blood oxy-
genation analogues, in controlled solutions. These results
point towards a future where the unique capabilities of PA
sensing can transition from specialized laboratory equip-
ment into compact, embedded systems, enabling continuous,
multi-biomarker sensing.

2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Principles of PA Sensing

PA sensing uses light-induced acoustic signals to probe a
sample. A laser pulse (“on”) deposits energy that produces
a thermoelastic expansion. When the pulse ends (“off”), the
expansion relaxes and emits an ultrasonic wave that can be
detected with an ultrasound transducer. Target molecules un-
der the skin absorb the laser’s light selectively. For example,
as shown in Figure 2, water strongly absorbs energy in some
specific bands, which are different from hemoglobin. For
example, at short wavelengths (approximately 200-800 nm),
water's absorption coefficient is orders of magnitude lower
than that of hemoglobin or melanin.

The process begins when a nanosecond-length laser pulse,
typically less than 100 ns, rapidly deposits energy into a ma-
terial. The short pulse length is crucial because it ensures
that during illumination, both the heat diffusion and me-
chanical expansion are negligible, effectively confining the
thermal and stress energy to the localized area until the pulse
ends. This confinement creates a sharp, well-defined acous-
tic signal. The initial pressure, po, generated at the location
of absorption is the fundamental signal in PA sensing. Its
amplitude is directly proportional to the absorbed optical
energy and can be described by the following equation:

Po(x) =T palx) F, (1)

where po(x) is the initial pressure rise at a specific location
x, which is directly related to the detected ultrasound signal.
This pressure is the product of three factors: I describes how
efficiently heat is converted into pressure; jg(x), the optical
absorption coefficient, which is the critical sensing parameter
as it is proportional to the molecule’s concentration; and
F, the optical fluence, which represents the laser energy
delivered per unit area.

2.2 System Design Considerations

Equation 1 provides a key insight for our system design: the
measured acoustic signal can be directly used to quantify the
target molecule’s concentration. This also establishes specific
design objectives for building effective PA sensing systems.
For the transmitter, a fundamental requirement for gen-
erating a PA signal is to create a rapid temperature change
in the sample. The most direct method to achieve this is by
delivering light in brief, high-energy pulses, which is the fo-
cus of this design. However, it’s also possible to generate PA
signals by rapidly modulating the intensity of a continuous
wave (CW) laser. Although intensity-modulated CW sources
can produce PA signals, achieving the required modulation
depth and power is more complex. Therefore, in this work we
focus on pulsed lasers. We also need multiple wavelengths to
differentiate the various types of absorbing molecules. The
pulses generated by these lasers have three important design
parameters: pulse energy, pulse width, and pulse repetition
rate. These parameters are directly controlled by the system
design and are critical for dictating the optical fluence deliv-
ered to the sample and the resulting PA signal properties. In
the next section, we analyze these three parameters in detail.

For the receiver, an ultrasound transducer converts the
acoustic pressure waves generated within the material into
an electrical signal. The transducer is sensitive to mechanical
energy and, in the context of PA sensing, function to capture
the transient pressure changes caused by optical absorption.
A core challenge is to design the electronic and processing

capabilities to amplify small PA signals without introduc-
ing substantial noise, while also supporting high-speed data
acquisition and efficient on-device processing.

For the material under test, the key principle of PA
sensing is that different molecules absorb specific colors
(wavelengths) of light in a unique way, like a ’color finger-
print’. This property enables two main types of analysis.
For a foundational task like tracking the concentration of a
single substance, one carefully chosen wavelength can be
sufficient. However, for more advanced applications, such as
differentiating multiple substances within a mixture, using
multiple wavelengths is beneficial. Varying the illuminating
wavelength can selectively excite different substances within
the material, enabling their identification and quantification
based on their unique PA responses. To validate these capa-
bilities, it’s crucial to test the system on simple, controlled
solutions before moving to complex biological tissues. There-
fore, this paper focuses on this foundational validation using
such solutions.

2.3. Safety Considerations

Commercial PA systems use high-brightness, nanosecond
class-IV lasers, which raises concerns for both eye safety and
skin exposure limits. The maximum permissible exposure
(MPE) depends on optical wavelength, pulse width, beam
size at the tissue, and exposure time [15]. For repeated pulses
there are two guidelines: (1) no single pulse may exceed the
per-pulse MPE, and (2) the total energy in any time window
must stay below the time-averaged MPE! Commercial sys-
tems often operate near these skin limits (tens of mJ/cm?
per pulse) to maximize SNR, which is why they also requires
strict eye protection’. Thus, preventing any eye exposure
with barriers and eyewear is mandatory, making operation
in open environments cumbersome.

Our compact design, on the other hand, minimizes expo-
sure at the source. It uses sub-microjoule, tens-of-nanoseconds

pulses in the visible and near-infrared, spreads or diffuses
the beam to lower energy density, and enforces hard limits
on per-pulse energy, repetition rate, and duty cycle. In a
representative case (905 nm, 220 nJ at 10 kHz, unfocused at
~ 1 cm), the skin fluence per pulse is ~ 1.4 x 107? mJ/cm?,
about 10*-10°x below the skin MPE. The 10 s average irradi-
ance is ~ 7 mW/cm’, far below the ~ 500 mW/cm? limit at
905 nm. Eye risk can be further minimized by incorporating
the source in a wearable design because the emitter works in
contact mode with mechanical baffling and enclosures that
remove any line of sight.

‘For skin, typical nanosecond limits are 20 mJ/cm? in the visible spec-
trum (400-700 nm), rising to ~ 50 mJ/cm? at 905 nm and 100 mJ/cm? for
1050-1400 nm.

?The per-pulse eye MPE at 905 nm is on the order of 5 x 1074 mJ/cm?, orders
of magnitude below the skin limits [15]
3. TRANSMITTER DESIGN

In Section 2, we identified three critical parameters for the
pulses generated by PA transmitters: pulse width, power
per pulse, and repetition rate. The width of the pulse needs
to be short, less than 200 nanoseconds, to confine heat to
a small region and produce a sharp acoustic response. A
minimum amount of power per pulse is essential to gener-
ate a detectable signal at the receiver. And the repetition
rate allows sending multiple subsequent pulses at a high
frequency, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Labo-
ratory systems and state-of-the-art (SoA) studies meet these
requirements [37], but at the cost of bulky optics, complex
electronics, cooling hardware, and costs in the range of tens
to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Our key research ques-
tion is: Can we design a photoacoustic system controlled by a
low-cost embedded platform?

The different values that the width, pulse power, and repe-
tition rate can take enable a flexible design space. To radiate
the necessary energy over a tissue, PA systems have different
design alternatives. One option is to send a high pulse power
(30 mJ), but at a slower repetition rate (10 Hz); while another
design could use the opposite tradeoff, send pulses with 100
times lower pulse power but at a repetition rate that is 10,000
times higher [4].

The challenge comes when we try to meet these same
requirements in a compact, embedded form. With complex
equipment, the entire design space is available because the
transmitter can generate a wide range of different pulses.
Embedded platforms, however, have limited energy, compu-
tational, and speed capabilities. Thus, two important ques-
tions need to be answered to enable embedded PA: What
combinations of width, pulse power, and repetition rate are fea-
sible with embedded systems? And, are those pulses sufficient
to trigger the required PA phenomenon?

The key contribution of our work is to bridge the gap between
PA and embedded systems by building upon concepts from
LiDAR technologies. In this section, we present our proof-of-
concept transmitter designed to bridge that gap.

3.1 Laser Driver Circuit

Commercial systems and SOA studies have (1) advanced
signal generator capabilities, enabling the transmission of
narrow pulses; and (2) high voltage sources, above 200 V, en-
abling pulses with high pulse power. Embedded platforms do
not have these capabilities. The slower processor constrains
the pulse width and repetition rate, and the low voltage
constrains the pulse power.

To attain the required narrow pulses for PA, our laser
driver design draws on methods developed in Light Detection
and Ranging (LiDAR) applications, where laser diodes are
driven in short pulses to enable fine ranging resolutions.

However, LiDAR applications have very different design
considerations. For example, they focus on timing accuracy
rather than high optical power, since eye-safety regulations
in an open environment prevent strong light emission.

The challenge is that, to excite PA signals, we need a laser
pulse that is as short as in LiDAR but also stronger at the
same time. Our key insight to enable the required pulse width
and pulse power for embedded PA is to adapt the two-stage
structure from LiDAR drivers to support stronger discharge
currents in a compact and embedded form, as shown in
Figure 3. To understand our design, we need to describe the
two-stage LiDAR approach.

The first stage is a slow charging path, in the order of
a few pus (Viaser-R1-C1). A power source (Vigser) Charges a
capacitor (C1) to a set voltage while the laser diode (LD1)
is disconnected from the circuit path. This stage defines
the energy available for each pulse and keeps supply noise
away from the diode. The size of the capacitor determines
a lower bound for the pulse width and an upper bound for
the repetition rate, which are central for PA. The energy
stored in the capacitor is proportional to the voltage and
capacitance that it can store according to the well-known
equation:

1 ‘
E= oe (2)

where C is the capacitance and V is the voltage the ca-
pacitor charges to. This means that the pulse energy can
be increased either by increasing the charge voltage, or by
increasing the capacitance. On embedded, low-power plat-
forms, the voltage V is often constrained. On the other hand,
increasing the capacitance C lengthens the recharge time
(reducing the maximum repetition rate) and increases the
pulse width.

The second stage is the fast path (U1-C1-LD1-R2). In an
ideal case, all of the stored energy would flow into the laser
diode instantaneously, producing an impulse-like current.
In reality, parasitic inductance and resistance, along with
the finite switching speed of the device, limit how quickly

this transfer can happen. These effects distort the pulse and
increase its width, making circuit layout and component
choice critical.

Overall, considering the two stages, our design focuses
on two main questions. First, what circuit design choices
would limit (dis)charge times and reduce pulse distortions?
Second, what are the maximum voltage and capacitance that
a low-power design should have to generate PA pulses? We
answer these questions in this section. The division into
slow and fast paths separates energy storage from energy
delivery, allowing us to explore pulse width, power, jitter,
and diode stress in a controlled way. With our approach, a
design pattern that originated in LiDAR for short, eye-safe
pulses becomes the basis for an integrated, higher-power
driver suited to PA transmission.

3.2 Laser Diode Selection

The vast majority of commodity laser diodes are optimized
for low-cost, continuous-wave (CW) operation for mass-
market applications like communications and illumination.
For generating high-current, nanosecond pulses needed for
PA signals, specialized pulsed laser diodes (PLDs) are re-
quired, but they are expensive and have limited availability.
This means that researchers often have to adapt commodity
CW laser diodes instead.

Prior work has shown that CW diodes can be repurposed
successfully to generate PA signals [39, 45, 46]. Seeger et
al. showed that these CW diodes, in pulsed operation, can
be driven well beyond their datasheet limits. They tolerated
peak currents up to 44 A and repetition rates up to 600 kHz
for several hours without damage [39]. These results estab-
lish a foundation for our work: low-cost diodes can serve
as practical transmitters when driven by complex drivers
and high-voltage sources. However, can those diodes still
generate a PA signal with a low power, simpler embedded
platform?

Building upon the SOA, we select laser diodes that are
inexpensive and easy to source, but to consider a more com-
prehensive evaluation, we also chose wavelengths spanning
the visible red (638 nm), near-infrared (904 nm), and deeper
infrared (1470 nm). This allows us to test across devices with
different optical characteristics, while also covering a spec-
trum from visible to NIR that is broadly relevant for sensing
and biomedical applications.

3.3. Embedded Low-Power Control Circuit

The limitations of current PA systems are that the drivers
require high-voltage sources to attain a high pulse power and
high-speed logic to generate pulses with nanosecond pulse
width. On the other hand, an embedded PA platform must be
portable, relying on a simple MCU and a low-power supply.

A decoupled approach: To obtain a narrow width. Our
key design choice is to decouple the control of the pulse
width from the MCU timing. The processor does not need to
match the laser’s pulse length, unlike what is done in the SoA
with high-speed processors. Instead, the MCU only provides
a trigger, and the width is set entirely by the capacitor dis-
charge in hardware. In this way, we do not need specialized
high-speed logic with nanosecond granularity; a low-cost,
general-purpose MCU is sufficient to provide a trigger. This
separation makes the design simpler and more flexible.

A voltage and capacitance trade off: To obtain the nec-
essary pulse power and repetition rate. An embedded platform
does not provide high voltages, limiting the ability to gen-
erate a higher pulse power. This means that, even if we
can send narrow pulses with our decoupled approach, the
amount of energy reaching the tissue may not be sufficient
to generate a recoverable PA signal. To balance simplicity
and higher signal energy, we restrict the input to a single
low-voltage rail at 5V, removing dependencies on multiple
power supplies. All additional voltage levels are generated
on board through voltage regulators. Later, we show that
with voltages in the range of 25-30 V and capacitances in
the range of 20-100 nF, we can attain pulse powers of a few
hundred nJ and repetition rates of tens of kilohertz, allowing
our embedded platform to generate recognizable PA signals.

Control modules. Figure 4 shows the overall control flow.
Our platform relies on an STM32F303CBT6 MCU to manage
timing, supply voltage, and monitor the system.

Step 1: On power-up, the MCU uses its DAC to set the laser
supply Viaser (16-30 V).

Step 2: A storage capacitor then charges to this Viaser level,
isolating the high-current discharge from supply noise, as
discussed previously.

Step 3: The MCU outputs a short digital pulse that turns
on the switch, discharging the capacitor through the diode.
This digital pulse also acts as a sync signal for the receiver.

Step 4: The capacitor releases the energy to the diode. A
sensing resistor is used to measure the current through the
diode, providing information for calibration, measurement,
and feedback in later revisions.

3.4 Transmitter Prototype

To demonstrate that compact and low-cost hardware can
deliver reproducible nanosecond pulses for PA sensing, we
developed a prototype board shown in Figure 5. The board
has three laser diodes. The MCU sets the repetition rate in
software, scalable into a few tens of kilohertz, so sensing
speed and averaging can be adjusted without additional tim-
ing hardware. The pulse width is determined solely by the
parasitics on the board (such as trace lengths), independent
of the trigger input, which means the system only requires
a slow digital trigger. As explained earlier, an important ad-
vantage of our design is that this separation also prevents
timing jitter from translating into optical variation and keeps
the output stable across bursts. ?

Figure 6 shows the measured laser-diode current for a
representative pulse. The waveform confirms a nanosecond-
scale (around 40 ns) pulse shaped by the driver. In a 10-second
run at 10 kHz (100,000 pulses), the peak current varies by
less than 1% across pulses. This validates that the circuit
consistently converts a simple 5 V input into controlled,
high-current pulses. The measured pulse energies are consis-
tent with those reported in prior work with more complex
PA systems [45], which indicates that even with reduced
absolute energy, our custom driver reaches an operational
range sufficient for biomedical use, as we showcase later on
in our evaluation.

Another important design decision for the second stage is to keep the loop
short to minimize inductance, the switch must operate with fast transitions
to preserve edge speed, and clamp components need to suppress overshoot
before it reaches the diode. Together, these constraints determine how
closely the circuit can approach the ideal pulse and set the limits on rise
time and peak current.

To place the prototype in context, we compare it against
a commercial laser platform commonly used in PA research,
the Opotek Radiant 532 LD. Table 3 summarizes the main
differences. The prototype board is small and lightweight,
while the Radiant is a large benchtop system weighing tens
of kilograms. The cost difference is also substantial, with
off-the-shelf diodes available for tens of dollars compared to
roughly 100,000 USD for the commercial unit.

The performance profiles reflect these differences in scale.
The Radiant is capable of producing pulses with mJ energies
and sub-10 ns widths, which remain beyond the capability of
compact diode drivers. On the other hand, our prototype
operates at repetition rates up to 100 kHz, much higher
than the 10 Hz of the commercial system‘. This makes it
particularly suited to applications that benefit from high
averaging rates or fast scanning. These comparisons show
that the two approaches could serve complementary roles.
High-energy, tunable sources remain necessary where maxi-
mum optical output is required, while compact diode drivers
enable low-cost, portable experiments that can be deployed
outside traditional laboratory environments.

Power consumption: The prototype draws 61mA from a 5 V
supply (~ 305mW) while sequencing the three diodes at
638 nm, 905 nm, and 1470 nm at 15 kHz. Because each pulse is
around 50 ns (0.05 % duty cycle at 10 kHz), the time-averaged

4The commercial system has the resources to generate repetition rates
higher than ours, but they do not need to because thanks to their high
voltages, individual pulses have a very high pulse power (more than 50
times higher than ours), requiring a much lower repetition rate to deliver
the same energy on the tissue.

electrical power delivered to the diodes is small. Accordingly,
we measure essentially the same average power consumption
whether operating a single diode or sequencing all three. The
power budget is dominated by the MCU and the DC-DC
converters rather than the laser pulses.

This approach differs fundamentally from high-energy
commercial systems, which prioritize per—pulse optical en-
ergy and narrow bandwidth at the expense of wall—plug effi-
ciency, often as low as 0.1%, so the electrical burden grows
quickly [33]. At 0.1% efficiency, delivering 1 W of average
optical power requires 1,000 W of electrical input.

At our operating point, the system consumes ~ 0.6 W
and produces = 14mW of average optical power in total
(10.6 mW @ 905 nm, 2.6mW @ 638nm, 1.2 mW @ 1470nm),
corresponding to a wall—plug efficiency of ~ 2.3%. Equiva-
lently, achieving 1 W of average optical power at this effi-
ciency would require ~ 43 W of electrical input—about 23x
less input power than a 0.1% - efficient system (and ~ 2.3x
less than a 1% system). These figures place our prototype in
the complementary regime of low average power and com-
pact implementation. In addition, because the MCU (around
150 mW) and power electronics (generatingViaser) dominate
the power budget, we can further reduce the power consump-
tion by powering them down whenever the system is idle,
and selecting a low-power MCU, since the design imposes
no stringent GPIO- or clock-speed requirements.

3.5 Pushing the Limits of the Laser Diode

With our laser diode transmitter, we generate much lower
per-pulse energy than commercial systems, but at a much
higher repetition rate. Because the signal strength of the
transmitter is crucial to our signal quality, we need to also
understand the limit of this architecture: how much energy
can we deliver while preserving short pulses?

In this section, we bypass the on-board DC-DC converter
and drive the laser charge node from an external supply,
allowing a wide sweep of the charge voltage Viaser while
independently varying the storage capacitance C,. These two
parameters set the per-pulse energy, as shown in Equation 2,
and they also shape the optical waveform. Raising Viaser is
the most direct way to increase energy without inherently
lengthening the pulse, but it also increases electrical stress
on the switch and laser diode and can introduce ringing and
overshoot in the drive network. Increasing C, also increases
energy, but it extends recharge time and tends to broaden
the pulse. If thermal or stress confinement conditions are
not met (due to the pulse width being too large), the SNR of
the PA signal degrades further.

As shown in Figure 7, increasing the driver voltage raises
per-pulse energy, but it also pushes the small, low-power
laser diodes toward their limit. In our setup, about 45 A peak
current (roughly 26-30 V supply) is already close to the max-
imum limit these laser diodes can tolerate. HL63373HD and
HL63193MG at 638 nm, OPT1470 at 1470 nm (all ~ 1W CW),
and ML562G86 (4.5 W CW) show similar breaking points
clustered near 28-30 V. This indicates that our nominal op-
erating point is already near the safe ceiling for the low-
power diodes. By contrast, SPLPL90_3 (75 W CW) accepts
substantially higher drive; with the supply at 80 V it remains
functional and reaches about 100 p/J per pulse at 10 kHz.

Changing the storage capacitance has a different effect.
Larger capacitance increases the current pulse widths and
also increases energy without raising the peak voltage. Within
the range we tested there is still comfortable margin, since
the peak current stays the same and the duty cycle only
marginally increased. Even with a longer pulse, the low-
power diodes do not reach their limit, and the driver stays
stable. By increasing the capacitance, we can still push the

power per pulse to about four times the original setup while
maintaining a sub- 100 ns pulse width. Unlike Viaser, increas-
ing capacitance does not increase the risk of damaging the
laser diodes. Based on our analysis, the final list of compo-
nents used in our circuit driver is shown in Table 4.

4 WATERTANK EXPERIMENT

We have so far established that our transmitter design trades
high pulse energy for a much higher repetition rate compared
to commercial systems. The crucial system-level question
now is: Can these lower-energy pulses produce a detectable PA
signal in a realistic setting? We answer this using a water-
tank experiment, a standard validation in PA research. Water
provides a controlled, homogeneous medium with a sound
speed similar to soft tissue, allowing us to test our system in
a medium that mimics the human body’s acoustic properties
but without biological variability. This experiment allows us
to directly assess whether our transmitter’s high repetition
rate averaging can compensate for its lower per-pulse energy.

4.1 Experiment Setup

We use a standard water-tank transmission setup, where
the transmitter (laser diode) and the receiver (ultrasound
probe) are on opposite sides of the sample, as shown in
Figure 8a. From the bottom of the setup, a laser diode emits
light through a transparent film into a black rubber target

Xu et al.

Received Voltage [V]

Time [us]

Figure 10: Received voltage at a single pulse

(object under test) and a water bath. The light absorbed by the
target (rubber) generates a PA pulse that travels through the
water and is detected by a 1 MHz, 20 mm-diameter ultrasound
probe positioned above. This arrangement is used as a first
test in PA sensing for several reasons. The black rubber
target acts as a simple, high-contrast substitute for biological
light absorbers, providing a strong signal to confirm the
system’s basic functionality. Water has a much lower optical
absorption than the rubber, ensuring that light is absorbed
primarily by the target. Furthermore, the known speed of
sound in water (1,480 m/s) allows for simple time-of-flight
verification of the PA signal, as we show next.

We evaluate detectability at two probe-target separations:
a small height (~2 cm) and a large height (~2.5 cm). The
small height establishes a baseline PA signal and anchors
timing; the large height lengthens the path, reducing SNR
and delaying arrivals, which also emulates monitoring shal-
lower vs. deeper on-body tissues. The signal recorded by the
ultrasound probe then passes through a low-noise pream-
plifier (SR560) with 40 dB gain. A logic analyzer records
the amplified waveforms continuously for one second, the
recording is then segmented into individual PA signals and
summed across segments for analysis. To compare our sys-
tem vs. a ground truth, we also repeat this experiment using
the commercial PA system, OPOTEK Radiant 532 LD.

4.2 Detecting a PA signal

As expected from the transmitter characterization in Sec-
tion 3, the energy from a single pulse of our laser diode is
insufficient to generate a signal visible above the noise floor
(red curve in Figure 10), while a single high-energy pulse
from the commercial system provides a reliable PA signal
(blue curve in Figure 10). However, the strength of our sys-
tem is in the high and stable repetition rate provided by our
design. Figure 11a shows that, by firing the laser at 10 kHz
and averaging the received signals over a one-second win-
dow (10,000 pulses), we recover a clear PA signal with an SNR
comparable to that of the commercial system, which fires
only 10 high-energy pulses in the same interval (Figure 11b).
This result confirms that our design choice, exchanging high
pulse energy for a high repetition rate, is a viable strategy for
generating detectable PA signals with low-cost, low-power,
compact hardware.

Figure 11: PA signals from custom and commercial systems.

An extra test required to validate that we are measuring
a true PA signal is to verify its timing against the physical
setup. With approximately 2 cm between the target and the
probe, we expect the first arrival to appear at ~13 pts after
the trigger. This matches the peak we see in the blue curve
in Figure 11a. A second peak at ~40 1s matches a longer
reflected path about three times the direct distance. In addi-
tion, a genuine acoustic signal should take longer to arrive
at a farther distance, while electrical interference would ap-
pear at the same time. As shown in Figure 11a, the coupling
noise for both distances occurs at the same time, while the
signal arrival is delayed for the larger height, confirming
its acoustic nature. Finally, in the frequency domain, the
FFT concentrates near 1 MHz, consistent with the center fre-
quency of the ultrasound probe (Figure 11c). Together, these
checks support that the recorded waveforms are PA pulses
with properties similar to those of a commercial system.

5 EMBEDDED RECEIVER DESIGN

In the previous sections, we show that our custom transmit-
ter, despite limited power, produces a clear PA pulse mea-
sured with advanced (benchtop) receiver instruments (Fig-
ure 9). In this section, we propose a compact receiver design.
The receiver chain of our platform is simpler than the trans-
mitter, as there is no high-current switching or nanosecond
pulse requirements, but it is still not trivial to implement on a
small embedded platform: Individual PA signals are extremely
faint and sits near the noise floor, requiring careful amplifi-
cation and high-speed digital processing to be recovered. Our
goal is to replicate the performance of the benchtop receiver
and processing chain on a small, portable board, enabling a
full PA sensing system (transmitter and receiver) that can
work outside of a laboratory.

5.1 Receiver Design

Our receiver has three stages, each addressing a specific
challenge in recovering the faint PA signals. The main com-
ponents of the system are shown in Figure 12a. The first
stage (amplification) is required to enhance the low-energy
pulse sent by our transmitter. The second and third stages
are needed to overlap and average the individual pulses into

a decodable signal. This tight co-design of transmitter and
receiver is critical to obtain a compact PA system.

Stage 1: Amplifying the faint analog signal. The raw signal
from the ultrasound transducer is on the order of pV, far
too weak to be digitized directly and can be easily lost in
electronic noise. To address the low SNR, we design a high-
gain, low-noise amplification stage. Our implementation uses
a passive high-pass filter to remove slow drift, followed by
three cascaded ADA4807 op-amp stages (60 dB total). We use
a multi-stage design because it preserves signal bandwidth
better than a single high-gain stage. An LTC6363 amplifier
provides the final conditioning before digitization.

Stage 2: Digitizing the high-frequency waveform. Convert-
ing a high-speed signal into a digital form is an inherently
challenging process, as high-speed signals are more suscepti-
ble to electronic noise and timing errors. We use high-speed
sampling to create a high-resolution digital snapshot of the
waveform. This is accomplished with an LTC2203 Analog-
to-Digital Converter (ADC) running at 25 MSPS. This high
sample rate is much faster than the signal’s 1 MHz center
frequency, ensuring we accurately capture its features. A
74VCX245 buffer isolates the ADC’s fast outputs to maintain
signal integrity during the transfer for processing.

Stage 3: Extracting the signal from noise. Even after amplifi-
cation, the signal from a single pulse has extremely low SNR.
The key is to leverage the thousands of pulses generated by
our high-repetition-rate transmitter. For this, we perform
real-time averaging directly on the FPGA board (Figure 12b).
For each pulse, it captures a 200 ps window of ADC data and
adds it to an accumulating buffer in memory. This process
amplifies the PA signal while the random noise averages out
toward zero. A MicroBlaze soft processor handles configura-
tion, allowing a user to read the final, clean waveform over
a simple UART link. This on-device processing makes the
receiver a truly self-contained, embedded system.

5.2 Receiver Prototype

To validate our design, we built a compact prototype receiver
(60 mm = 100 mm) and performed an end-to-end system test
(Figure 12c). The goal is to demonstrate that our complete

embedded platform, which combines the low-energy trans-
mitter from Section 3 with the new receiving and processing
chain, can successfully reproduce the results of the watertank
experiment from Section 4 without requiring any external
benchtop equipment.

As shown in Figure 13, the fully embedded system success-
fully recovered the same faint PA signals, with clear direct
and reflected arrivals consistent with the bench measure-
ments. The appearance of the waveform differs from the
signals in Figure 11 because the unipolar ADC records only
positive values, so negative voltages are effectively “folded”
into the positive range (similar to rectification). These effects,
however, do not change the processing. This is a crucial re-
sult: it confirms that our on-board amplification and real-time
averaging are effective enough to detect the weak pulses gen-
erated by our custom transmitter. This demonstrates a func-
tional, self-contained PA system from laser light emission to
the final digital PA signals.

The transmitter draws around 305 mW , and the receiver
consumes around 890 mW during active sampling. This re-
flects the use of high-speed components needed for multi-
MHz sampling (ADC) and on-device real-time processing
(FPGA). This puts the total system power budget at 1.2 W.
On a standard 3,000 mAh USB power bank, this would allow
for over 4 hours of continuous operation for the entire plat-
form. In a practical, wearable scenario, the system would be
duty-cycled, sleeping between measurements, which could
extend the battery life to many days.

6 EXPERIMENTAL DEMONSTRATION

In this section, we take a first step toward multi-biomarker
PA sensing with two controlled chemical demonstrations:
(1) tracking glucose concentration in water and (2) unmix-
ing copper and nickel sulfates solutions, which are com-
monly used as stable, simpler solutions that serve as a reli-
able stand-in for the more complex biological molecules of
oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin [8, 9]. We choose
these biomarkers because they are central for clinical moni-
toring and treatment [1, 10]. The ability to monitor changes
in glucose concentration is foundational for non-invasive
diabetes management. The second demonstration, differenti-
ating between oxy- and deoxy- hemoglobin, is the principle
behind measuring blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). This is
a critical vital sign used to monitor vascular and respira-
tory health. These two tests, therefore, serve as foundational
proofs-of-concept for some of the most impactful potential
applications of this technology.

6.1 Glucose Solution

The primary requirement for any non-invasive diabetes mon-
itor is the ability to reliably track whether glucose levels are
rising or falling. This experiment tests that core function.
By preparing solutions with increasing glucose concentra-
tions, we validate a fundamental question: does our system
produce a consistent, predictable signal change that corre-
sponds to different glucose levels? Proving this capability
is an essential first step toward building a device that can
one day distinguish between low, normal, and high glucose
states in the body in a non-invasive manner.

Under a setup with fixed optics and geometry (Figure 8),
we prepare glucose solutions from 0 to 12.5 mg/mL. This
range partially overlaps with physiological values. Typical
blood glucose is ~0.7 to 1.4 mg/mL, and people with diabetes
can exceed 2 mg/mL [2]. The higher end of our range also
aligns with nonclinical settings: fruit juices have 10 to 50
mg/mL (or even higher for certain fruits) [23]. Overall, this
range lets us test well-defined levels while staying relevant
to both medical and nonclinical contexts.

For our analysis, each trace is cross-correlated with a refer-
ence (water with no glucose). To estimate changes in glucose

levels, it is central to estimate the arrival time and peak am-
plitude of the PA signals. The received traces are shown
in Figure 14a; and Figure 14b summarizes both trends: as
concentration increases, the arrival time shifts earlier and
the peak amplitude increases across the range. Both trends
are consistent with underlying glucose physics. The earlier
arrival time corresponds to a known increase in the speed of
sound as glucose concentration rises. More importantly for
this application, the increase in signal amplitude is the di-
rect result of higher glucose concentrations absorbing more
light, producing a stronger PA response. These results show
that our system detects the critical property of concentration
shifts in arrival time and amplitude.

6.2 Spectral Unmixing

We now tackle a more complex challenge that directly mim-
ics the real-world application of measuring blood oxygen
saturation (SpO2). This measurement requires a device to
distinguish between two different forms of hemoglobin (oxy-
genated and deoxygenated) that are always mixed together
in the blood. This chemical mixture behaves linearly: the to-
tal PA signal we measure is simply the sum of the individual
signals from the copper and nickel components, weighted
by their concentration. Because this is the same fundamen-
tal challenge as separating the signals from two types of
hemoglobin in blood, this test is directly relevant for validat-
ing our system’s potential for blood-oxygen measurements
[8, 9]. We use the 638 nm and 905 nm laser diodes because at
these specific wavelengths, the absorption coefficients of cop-
per and nickel sulfate are significantly different, providing a
distinct signature for each chemical.

For each sample in Figure 14d, the PA amplitudes, P(A),
were normalized by the corresponding per-pulse laser energy,
E(A) (which we measured in Section 3). The resulting energy-
normalized measurement vector, B, is modeled as a linear
function of the molar absorption coefficients (€) and effective
concentrations (C) of copper and nickel:

B= P(A,)/E(A1) €cu(Ai)  eni(A1)
~ |P(A2)/EQ2) €cu(Az)  eni(A2)

. (3)

Cou
Cni

This equation can be expressed in matrix form as B = MC,
where M is the 2 x 2 extinction matrix containing the known
absorption coefficients (from the SIMPA library [11]) and C
is the unknown concentration vector. The concentrations
for each sample are found by solving this system of linear
equations: C = M~!B. Once the effective concentrations Cc,
and Cy; are determined, the raw fractional concentration of
copper, fraw, is calculated for each sample:

Cou
Cou + Cni

raw = (4)

To align the measurements with the experimental de-
sign, where samples spanned the full range from 0% to 100%
copper, the raw fractions were scaled using an endpoint-
anchored affine transformation. This normalization maps
the calculated fraction of the first sample (i = 1) to 0 and
that of the final sample (i = N) to 1, thereby correcting for
baseline offsets or scaling discrepancies.

Figure 14c compares the estimated composition against
the intended mixture for five Cu/Ni samples. The shaded
backgrounds indicate the ground truth (GT): blue for Cu%
and orange for Ni%. The purple and yellow curves show the
estimated Ni% and Cu% from the unmixing performed with
received PA signals. The plot suggests that two-wavelength
unmixing tracks the intended mixture proportions.

Together, the glucose and Cu/Ni sulfate tests indicate that
our platform is able to detect concentration-dependent shifts
in arrival time and amplitude and can recover binary mix-
ture proportions with two wavelengths. These outcomes
align with the design goals and offer a promising basis for
extending the platform to additional wavelengths and to
tissue-mimicking or more complex environments.

7 RELATED WORK

We review three areas related to embedded PA sensing. PA
imaging uses the same underlying mechanism and demon-
strates a wide range of applications. PA sensing focuses on
concentration and composition, aiming at quantity-oriented
outputs. Work on embedded sensing shows common approaches
for small, low-power systems. Together, these areas motivate
our design choices and the scope of our study.

PA imaging. PA imaging has demonstrated broad clinical
potential, with studies in dermatology [30], oncology [5],
rheumatology [49], neuroscience [28], and ophthalmology
[19], and with two commercial systems receiving FDA clear-
ance and CE marking [27, 37]. These clinical applications
underscore the relevance of PA imaging while also revealing
practical limitations. Today’s PA imaging systems often rely
on high-power lasers and high-channel ultrasound hardware,
which drives significant cost, size, and workflow complex-
ity. Active research on light sources and detectors aims to
improve detection sensitivity, portability, cost, and footprint.
For example, by using LEDs instead of lasers [21, 43] or over-
driving low-cost laser diodes [39, 45], PA imaging systems
could move from specialized labs into point-of-care settings.
Nonetheless, little has been demonstrated using embedded
systems to date. Our simplified system reduces complexity
and cost while maintaining focus on potential applications.
PA sensing. PA sensing (sometimes also called PA spectroscopy)
is used across domains, including gas and breath analysis
[32], food and agriculture [7, 48], materials characterization
[16], and health monitoring [20]. However, similar to PA
imaging, these devices rely on high-power pulsed lasers.
Few studies have explored compact PA sensing systems, but
they still rely on bulky and costly benchtop hardware [12, 25].
Two works are particularly relevant. A wrist-worn PA sensor
reports human data on superficial blood vessels and blood-
flow changes, which demonstrates that on-body operation
is possible [50]. However, the laser, optics, electronics, and
power supply are housed in a backpack (7 kg) that is con-
nected to the wrist unit by tethered cables. The backpack still
needs to be connected to an external power supply. A second
work, Nutrilyzer, builds a low-cost PA spectrometer from
LEDs to quantify liquid samples in a small cuvette [36]. This
represents a step toward portable PA sensing, but it remains
a benchtop system and uses 10 Hz LED light with a 50%
duty cycle, which is not strictly a PA signal. Together, the
above studies point towards the need for a low-power, em-
bedded PA system that packages the light source, acoustics,
and processing in a single, deployable device.

Sensing with other modalities. The systems community has

built biomedical sensors using light, acoustics, and RF based
modalities. Optical approaches (cameras, LEDsa, and photo-
diode wearables) are compact, but they mainly measure shal-
low blood-flow changes at the skin and are sensitive to mo-
tion and ambient light [3]. Phone acoustics can screen sleep
apnea or estimate lung function with speaker-microphone
hardware, yet they sense motion or airflow rather than chem-
istry and often require controlled posture [29, 44]. RF systems

recover breathing and sometimes heart rate through cloth-
ing and walls, but performance degrades with multipath and
movement, and the signals reflect bulk dielectric properties,
not molecular content [14, 41].

8 DISCUSSION

This work delivers a first prototype that breaks a critical
initial barrier for embedded PA sensing: an end-to-end op-
toacoustic—processing chain that, using compact hardware,
reliably detects signals and spectrally distinguishes targets
under controlled conditions. Testing in homogeneous media
(water) and solution phantoms (glucose and Cu/Ni mixtures)
isolates the sensing pathway, allowing measured changes
to be attributed to the chain rather than to tissue variabil-
ity or motion. These experiments demonstrate stable PA
arrivals and consistent two-wavelength discrimination in
simple solutions, establishing the foundation for deployment
in heterogeneous tissues and opening the path toward quan-
titative, on-body sensing. Despite these achievements, a few
barriers remain before embedded PA can be a reality.

Barrier 1: Robustness in dynamic media. Water provides a

homogeneous media to isolate the sensing chain and verify
end-to-end behavior. The next step is to carry out exper-
iments in more complex media such as fruit juice, along
with tissue-mimicking phantoms that approximate skin, fat,
and muscle. More complex media will help reveal how var-
ious layers affect the PA signals. Running experiments in
these settings will both confirm stability and guide targeted
improvements, so the system remains reliable outside a con-
trolled environment. These studies are the natural next steps
for this work and move the prototype from proof-of-principle
toward practical sensing.

Barrier 2: Absolute quantity readouts. We are able to show

concentration-dependent changes in glucose solution and
Cu/Ni sulfate mixtures, evidence that the system captures
meaningful, spectrally interpretable variation. Building on
these relative results, the next step is to turn trends into
predictive conditions. One such example is predictive mod-
eling, using information across wavelengths and time to
classify or predict conditions (for example, flagging high glu-
cose ranges). This type of prediction will bring our platform
closer to user-ready devices.

Barrier 3: An improved ultrasound receiver. In this study, we

used an off-the-shelf, single-element resonant receiver to
keep the system simple. The trade-off is limited bandwidth
and minimal spatial information. Spatial information and
broad bandwidth are key in many applications: it enables
source localization, separation from background, rejection of
reflections and motion, and stable performance when place-
ment or coupling changes. Multiple-receiver arrays would
enable more predictions for a wider range of applications.

9 CONCLUSION

This work establishes the first step toward embedded PA.
Guided by transmitter—receiver co-design insights, we ex-
plore the use of low-cost, low-power laser diodes as com-
pact, high-repetition optical sources. Building on these in-
sights, we perform evaluations in controlled environments
that show concentration-dependent trends for glucose and
two-wavelength unmixing of Cu/Ni sulfate mixtures. These
results demonstrate the potentials for multi-biomarker sens-
ing. With this foundation, the remaining challenges to bring
embedded PA closer to the user are enhanced operation in
everyday and layered media, quantitative or predictive rec-
ommendations, and receivers that add spatial information.
Overall, our findings mark a first step and widen the design
space for low-cost, portable PA sensing.
