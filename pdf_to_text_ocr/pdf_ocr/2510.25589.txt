ABSTRACT

Aims. eROSITA on board of the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG) spacecraft performed its first X-ray all-sky survey (ERASS1)
between December 2019 and June 2020. It detected about 930000 sources, providing us with an unprecedented opportunity for a
detailed blazar census. We present the properties of blazars and blazar candidates in eRASS1 and the compilation of the eROSITA
blazar catalog.

Methods. We compile a list of blazar and blazar candidates from the literature and match it with the eRASS1 catalog, creating the
Blazars in eRASS1 (BlazEr1) catalog. For sources with more than 50 counts we obtain their X-ray spectral properties. We compile
multiwavelength data from the radio to the y-ray regimes for all sources, including multiwavelength spectral indices and redshifts.
The full catalog is available online.

Results. We present the BlazEr1 catalog, containing 5865 sources, of which 2106 are associated with confirmed blazars. For 3668
sources, eROSITA provides the first X-ray data. The contamination from non-blazar sources of the entire sample is less than 11%.
Most candidates exhibit properties typical for blazars. We present properties of the entire X-ray detected blazar population, including
the distributions of X-ray luminosities and photon indices, multiwavelength properties, and the blazar log N-log S distribution. Our
catalog provides follow up targets, such as potential MeV and TeV blazars.

Conclusions. The BlazEr1 catalog provides a compilation of X-ray detected blazars and blazar candidates. The catalog serves as a
starting point for exploiting further eROSITA surveys using the same methodology, enabling us to study the X-ray variability and a
large number of spectral energy distributions of blazars in the future.

(Blandford & Rees 1978; Blandford & Konig] 1979; Antonucci spectrum on time scales from minutes to years (e.g., Urry 1996;

Tanihata et al. 2001; Ciaramella et al. 2004; Agarwal et al. 2015;
Rajput et al. 2020).

Blazars emit a double-peaked multiwavelength spectral en-
ergy distribution (SED, see, e.g., Middei et al. 2022; their Fig. 1),
which is often modeled by two log-parabola components (Mas-
saro et al. 2006; Hinton & Hofmann 2009; Madejski & Sikora
2016; KrauB et al. 2016; and references therein). The low-energy
peak originates from synchrotron emission of electrons (and pos-
sibly positrons) in the relativistic jets (e.g., Marscher & Gear
1985). The peak of this emission component is typically lo-
cated between the radio and the optical bands (Fossati et al.
1998). In contrast, the high-energy component, with the high-
est level of emission in the y rays, can be explained with lep-
tonic, hadronic, or lepto-hadronic models (Béttcher et al. 2013).
In the leptonic scenario, the jet is assumed to consist of elec-
trons and positrons. Photons inverse Compton scatter off of
the relativistic electrons/positrons in the jet to higher energies.
The up-scattered photons could originate from the same pop-
ulation of synchrotron photons (Synchrotron Self Compton ra-
diation; SSC; Ginzburg & Syrovatskii 1965; Rees 1967; Jones
et al. 1974; Maraschi et al. 1992; Dermer & Schlickeiser 1993;
Bloom & Marscher 1996) or other photon fields such as ther-
mal emission from the accretion disk, the broad line region
or the torus (External Compton; EC; Sikora et al. 1994; Ghis-
ellini & Madau 1996; Finke 2016; and references therein). In
hadronic models, the high-energy peak would be produced ex-
clusively by relativistic protons (e.g., Mannheim & Biermann
1992; Mannheim 1993; Miicke & Protheroe 2001; Miicke et al.
2003). Here, proton-photon interactions produce pions. Neutral
pions and their subsequent decay cascades then produce the
observable X-ray and y-ray photons (Liodakis & Petropoulou
2020). Letponic and hadronic SED models are able to describe
multiwavelength data adequately well due to degeneracies, in-
complete multiwavelength coverage, non-simultaneous data, and
additional systematic uncertainties (e.g., B6ttcher et al. 2013).

The spectral position of the peaks is a useful tool to classify
blazars based on the energy of their synchrotron peak (Fossati
et al. 1998; Abdo et al. 2010). Sources with low-energy peaks
at Vpeak S 10'4 Hz, above Vpeak = 10> Hz, and in the interme-
diate range are called low (LSPs), high (HSPs), and interme-
diate peaked blazars (ISPs), respectively (Padovani & Giommi
1996). The X-ray band tends to fall in the energy range near
the transition between the synchrotron and the high-energy peak.
In a vF, representation, this results in a falling X-ray spectrum
([ > 2.0) for a higher-peaked source where the X-rays probe
the synchrotron emission. A low-peaked source exhibits a rising
([ < 2.0) X-ray spectrum, that is, X-rays are part of the high-
energy peak (Blandford et al. 2019; and references therein). This
basic classification with regard to the photon index from a single
snap shot observation can be systematically affected by source
variability, as during outburst and flares, sources can exhibit a
peak-shift behavior, including possible extreme HSP behavior
(e.g., Pian et al. 1998; Giommi et al. 2000; Ahnen et al. 2018;
Sahu et al. 2021; Gokus et al. 2024b).

Blazars have historically been classified based on optical
spectra: sources showing emissions lines with widths of > 5A
are called flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs, Stickel et al.
1991), while sources with weaker or even no emission lines are
classified as BL Lacs (BLLs). In the context of the peak en-
ergy classification, FSRQs are predominately LSPs, while BLLs
are distributed among all these different categories (Ghisellini
et al. 1998). FSRQs are more bolometrically luminous (Ghis-
ellini 2013). In fact, the position of the synchrotron peak is
thought to be connected to the overall luminosity via the so-

called “blazar sequence” — that is, due to more efficient cooling
the more luminous sources peak at shorter frequencies (Fossati
et al. 1998; Ghisellini 2013). It is not clear, however, if this se-
quence is due to selection effects (see e.g. Giommi et al. 2012;
Keenan et al. 2021).

In order to understand the population and the X-ray proper-
ties of blazars as a whole, it is necessary to systematically study
a large sample. Blazars have been targets of many X-ray obser-
vations, mainly focused on bright or variable sources, due to the
extensive multiwavelength campaigns required for SED model-
ing. Different X-ray observatories have been used to build X-ray
catalogs. For these catalogs of known blazars, identified through
optical, radio, and y-ray surveys (catalogs such as compiled by,
e.g., Massaro et al. 2015; Ackermann et al. 2015), were matched
against the observational data. Samples obtained using only one
observatory were built using Einstein (Worrall & Wilkes 1990;
55 sources), EXOSAT (Sambruna et al. 1994a,b; 26 sources),
Beppo-SAX (Donato et al. 2005; 86 sources), ROSAT (Urry et al.
1996, 36 BLLs, Perlman et al. 1996b, 23 BLLs, Turriziani et al.
2007, 510 confirmed and 173 new blazars), Swift-XRT (Giommi
et al. 2019; OUSXB!: 2308 sources), XMM-Newton (de la Calle
Pérez et al. 2021; 103 sources), and NuSTAR (Middei et al. 2022;
126 sources). Other studies have used data from multiple X-ray
missions (e.g., Comastri et al. 1997; Donato et al. 2001; Kadler
2005; Fan et al. 2012; Kapanadze 2013; Yuan & Fan 2014;
>500 sources), often aiming at the multiwavelength properties of
blazars. All these catalogs only cover previously observed areas
of the sky, therefore, these observations are often biased towards
the pre-selected sources proposed as observation targets, which
may introduce further biases in sky coverage. The few X-ray cat-
alogs providing nearly all sky coverage suffer from limited flux
sensitivity and the number of sources in these samples is there-
fore small compared to the number of blazars known in other
bands.

A first X-ray sample with all-sky coverage and a deeper
X-ray flux limit was obtained with the ROSAT all-sky survey
(RASS; Truemper 1982, 1993; Voges et al. 1999, 2000). The
newest RASS catalog (2RXS; Boller et al. 2016) offers infor-
mation for roughly 135000 sources with a limiting sensitiv-
ity of Fx,01-24kev~ 107 erg cm~ s“! in the 0.1-2.4 keV band.
Shortly after its publication, RASS was used to study the pho-
ton index distributions of blazars (Urry et al. 1996; Perlman
et al. 1996b) and to derive blazar catalogs (e.g., Turriziani et al.
2007). For a long time, the RASS was the most comprehen-
sive X-ray all-sky survey. This changed with the advent of the
extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array
(eROSITA) on the Russian Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG)
satellite (Merloni et al. 2012; Sunyaev et al. 2021). Launched in
July 2019 from Baikonur, the mission began all-sky-survey op-
erations in December 2019 (Predehl et al. 2021; Merloni et al.
2024). Consisting of seven nearly identical Wolter type 1 X-
ray telescopes, called telescope modules (TMs), with a total
field of view of 1° and frame store CCDs in the focal plane,
eROSITA is sensitive in the 0.2-10.0keV band. eROSITA per-
formed an all-sky slew survey as SRG, which orbits Lz, con-
stantly rotated around the spacecraft-Earth axis with a period
of 4h. Distinct positions on the sky were therefore, on aver-
age, observed about six times in consecutive spacecraft rotations
while the source remained in the field of view for about 40s
during every visit. Close to the ecliptic poles, which coincide
with the survey poles, the number of consecutive observations

' DR3, which is based on 15 years of Swift-XRT data contains 2831
distinct blazars, we will use DR3 throughout the paper
Hammerich et al.: BlazEr1: The eROSITA Blazar Catalog

is a lot higher. Due to its L2-orbit and its rotation around the
Sun the whole sky could be covered within half a year. There-
fore, eROSITA allows us to observe the entire sky in a system-
atic, unbiased (unaffected by triggering on sources of interest)
way and to investigate source variability on time scales of hours
and months. In total, eROSITA observed the full sky four times
as operations had to be halted for political reasons during the
fifth all-sky scan in late February 2022. During the first all-sky
scan by eROSITA (eRASS1), between December 2019 and June
2020, nearly 930000 individual sources were detected on the
Western Galactic hemisphere, which is accessible to the Ger-
man eROSITA consortium (Merloni et al. 2024). This makes the
eRASS1 catalog the largest X-ray source catalog to date. In the
0.5-2.0keV band, 50% completeness across the entire sky is
achieved at a flux of < 5 x 10-'> ergcm™? s~!. The vast majority
of eRASS1 sources are AGN (~80%), which enables a census of
accreting supermassive black holes of unprecedented complete-
ness. eROSITA data therefore provide a great opportunity to in-
vestigate the X-ray properties of the blazar population. The first
eROSITA all-sky survey has already been used to identify poten-
tial TeV blazars for follow-up (Marchesi et al. 2025; Metzger
et al. 2025), to investigate neutrino events (Adriani et al. 2025),
to identify high-redshift blazars (Wolf et al. 2024), and to study
the intergalactic medium with blazars (Gatuzz et al. 2024).

We present the first eROSITA eRASS1 blazar catalog, in-
cluding the X-ray identification and the X-ray and multiwave-
length properties of blazars and blazar candidates found during
eRASS1. In Sect. 2, we discuss the preparation of a sample of
previously known blazars and blazar candidate sources, which is
matched against the eRASS1 all-sky data. In Sect. 3, we describe
our identification of blazars and the analyses of the eROSITA
data. Additional multiwavelength data are discussed in Sect. 4.
The properties of the blazars and blazar candidates observed by
eROSITA are discussed in Sect. 5. We summarize results and pro-
vide future prospects in Sect. 6. Throughout the paper, we will
assume a flat ACDM cosmology with Qa = 0.7, Qn = 0.3, and
Hoy = 70kms~! Mpc"! (Beringer et al. 2012).

2. The BLAZE catalog: a catalog of blazars from the
literature

As no recent standard catalog of blazars exists that includes all
claimed or confirmed candidates in the literature, in this section,
we describe how we create a “master” catalog of blazars and
blazar candidates by cross-matching existing catalogs from the
literature. This catalog is released with the paper.

2.1. Construction of the catalog

Older blazar compilations such as the Roma-BZCAT catalog
(Massaro et al. 2015) miss a large number of newer sources.
These catalogs are also significantly biased in terms of flux or re-
gion on the sky observed (e.g., Bellenghi et al. 2023). In order to
search for X-ray counterparts of known blazars, we constructed
a catalog of blazar and blazar candidates from catalogs found in
the literature. As many sources will be part of multiple catalogs,
we filter for duplicates by positional matching, taking into ac-
count the accuracy of the individual catalogs. The catalogs used
to build the “master” list, the number of sources provided by the
catalogs and the number of sources added, and the radii used to
identify duplicates with respect to other catalogs and the spectral
classes provided, are listed in Table 1.

Following, for instance, Giommi et al. (2019) and Bellenghi
et al. (2023), we combine all blazars and blazar candidates from
the latest data release of the fourth Fermi-LAT source catalog
(4FGL-DR4; Abdollahi et al. 2020, 2022), the Roma-BZCAT
multi-frequency catalog (Massaro et al. 2015), and the 3HSP
catalog (Chang et al. 2019). For source positions of the Fermi-
LAT blazars we use the coordinates of the associated counter-
parts provided in the 4FGL catalog, since the y-ray positions are
not well constrained enough. Duplicates were identified by po-
sition matching or using associations provided by the input cata-
logs. Since the catalogs have different spatial accuracy, each cat-
alog is assigned an individually selected maximum radius within
which sources were considered duplicates (see Table 1). In ad-
dition, we add 48 high-redshift blazars reported in the literature
(Yuan et al. 2000, 2003; Sowards-Emmerd et al. 2003; Romani
et al. 2004; Worsley et al. 2004; Shemmer et al. 2006; Healey
et al. 2008; Sbarrato et al. 2012, 2013, 2015, 2022; Ghisellini
et al. 2014, 2015b,a; Massaro et al. 2015; Coppejans et al. 2016;
Belladitta et al. 2019, 2020; Caccianiga et al. 2019; Ighina et al.
2019; Khorunzhev et al. 2021; An et al. 2023; Marcotulli et al.
2025). This sample of high-redshift sources has been compiled
by Sbarrato et al. (2025, in prep.), and extended by us with the
source discussed by Marcotulli et al. (2025). This sample will be
referred to as the HighZ sample.

In addition to sources with a confirmed blazar designation,
we added objects with properties that are similar to those of
blazars, with varying criteria depending on the input catalog. We
start with the Milliquas catalog (Version 8, Flesch 2023). This
catalog contains mainly AGN but also lists BL Lac-like objects
identified via various detection methods. Based on WISE data,
the KDEBLLACS and WIBRaLS2 catalogs provide candidate
blazars of various spectral types (D’Abrusco et al. 2019), while
the ABC catalog (Paggi et al. 2020) uses ALMA calibration
data as well as other multiwavelength information to character-
ize blazar candidates. The largest catalog used to build our candi-
date sample is the BROS catalog (Itoh et al. 2020). This catalog
lists objects which exhibit a flat radio spectrum and a counterpart
in Pan-STARRS1. Compared to other catalogs, BROS sources
are not homogeneously spread across the entire sky, but cover
areas with Galactic latitude |b] > 10° and declination 6 > —40°.
A small window centered around Galactic coordinates b ~ 40°
and 1 ~ 220° is excluded due to a lack of radio coverage. In
order to create the “master” list, we start with the first catalog
shown in Table 1, then cross-match with the next catalog, and
add any previously not included source, we continue with this
process down the list of catalogs in Table 1.

Our initial list after positional cross-matching contains
103498 individual blazars and blazar candidates spread over the
entire sky, 43148 (~41%) of which are located on the western
Galactic hemisphere due to the inhomogeneity of the BROS cat-
alog. Based on the input catalogs, we classify the blazars and
blazar candidates into the following classes: (1) a BL Lac ob-
ject is listed as BLL; (2) a galaxy dominated BL Lac Object is
denoted as BZG; (3) Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars are abbrevi-
ated as FSRQ; (4) confirmed blazars of unknown type are called
BCU. We append the letter ‘C’ to the abbreviation to indicate
that a source is a blazar candidate (BLLC, BCUC, FSRQC). If
no spectral classification is listed sources are denoted as BCUC,
this includes all entries originating from the BROS catalog.

2.2. Assessment of quality

No source in the initial “master” list is guaranteed to be a blazar,
especially since there are many candidates; thus it is important

Table 1. Blazar and blazar candidate catalogs used to build the BLAZE catalog. The order in which the catalogs are listed reflects the order in
which we merged the catalogs. As the 4FGL-DR4 catalog is used as the first added catalog there is no catalog against which it has to be checked for
duplicates, therefore, no match radius is listed. The radius given for the other catalogs is then used to filter for duplicates against all the previously
added catalogs (therefore, e.g., only 1724 sources from the 5th Roma BZCAT are added, since the other sources are already part of the 4FGL-DR4
catalog within 4”). The horizontal line divides the catalogs of confirmed blazars from those containing only blazar candidates.

to assess the contamination and remove as many non-blazars as
possible.

Due to the extremely complex selection function, assessing
the contamination is not straightforward. We therefore investi-
gate a few indicators and assign upper limits to the level of con-
tamination and check the purity of the input catalogs. In 4FGL
about 98% of AGN are confidently classified as blazars, and
we hence expect a very low level of contamination. A similar
level of purity is expected from BZCAT, however, this catalog
also contains radio galaxies such as Cen A. According to Xie
et al. (2024) about 5% of BZCAT sources are non-blazars. The
3HSP contamination is expected to be < 2% (Chang et al. 2019)
and similar levels are expected from the HighZ sample. Unfor-
tunately, no level of contamination is listed for the sample of
the Milliquas and the ABC. de Menezes et al. (2019) assessed
the contamination of the WIBRaLS2 and KDEBLLACS cata-
logs using SDSS. They find that 31% and 30%, respectively for
these catalogs, are blazars. The main contamination is caused
by QSOs (~69%), which could also be blazars, representing a
loosely constrained upper limit. These catalogs are also tested
by Xie et al. (2024). They find 14% and 12% to be non-blazars,
respectively. The difference between the estimated levels of con-
tamination for the WISE catalogs might be related to the entire
sample not having available data in both approaches and due to
other thresholds set to distinguish a blazar from a non-blazar. For
the BROS catalog, Itoh et al. (2020) estimate a contamination
of about 10%. Due to flux and spatial limits in the BROS data,
only 60% of the BZCAT sources are also present in this catalog.
Therefore, we expect roughly 5% of the blazars and about 14%
of the candidates listed in the “master” list to be non-blazars,
when utilizing the most conservative estimates presented above.

In order to identify non-blazar contamination by nearby
galaxies in our list and since blazars have higher redshifts, we
match with the HECATE catalog of nearby galaxies (Kovlakas
et al. 2021), at the time of writing one of the most complete
catalogs of galaxies in the local Universe (D < 200Mpc). We
obtain 1227 matches within 12” of the galaxy center, of which
1215 are located within the D2s-ellipse. Out of these, 57 posi-
tional matches are associated with confirmed blazars, including
well known sources with redshifts consistent with the matched
HECATE galaxy, hence the position alone is not enough to iden-

tify non-blazars. HECATE also offers a Hubble galaxy classifica-
tion (de Vaucouleurs et al. 1976). Out of the positional matches
689 correspond to a spiral galaxy. Since blazars are typically not
hosted in spiral galaxies (Urry et al. 2000; O’Dowd et al. 2002)
and a location within the D»;-ellipse with a maximum separa-
tion of 12” indicates that in X-rays the source is undistinguish-
able from the center of the Galaxy, we exclude these 689 objects,
almost 99% of which originate from the BROS catalog.

Xie et al. (2024) used moderate resolution radio images from
the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS; Lacy et al. 2020) to classify the
sources from BZCAT, WIBRaLS2, and KDEBLLACS based on
their morphology. We match the BLAZE catalog with their re-
sults using the match radii for the individual catalogs (see Ta-
ble 1). If a visual assessment of the morphology exists we use
this classification instead of the automated one. A two-sided ra-
dio morphology which is inconsistent with the source being a
blazar is found for 1139 objects, which are removed.

A fraction of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxy pop-
ulation is detected in the radio band (e.g., Komossa et al. 2006;
Singh & Chand 2018), among which a small sample has also
been detected in the y rays (e.g., Abdo et al. 2009; Paliya et al.
2018). Several works have shown that y-loud NLSy1s exhibit
blazar-like characteristics including bright flaring episodes (e.g.,
D’Ammando et al. 2015; Paliya & Stalin 2016; Gokus et al.
2021), but arrive at the conclusion that these objects resemble
less powerful, that is, younger sources. We exclude y-ray emit-
ting NLSy1 galaxies from the BLAZE catalog to consider only
‘full-scale’ blazars. Two NLSy 1s listed in the 4FGL are located
on the western Galactic hemisphere and detected by eROSITA
(leRASS J094857.1+002226 and leRASS J200754.9—443446).
To exclude NLSyls which do not show y-ray emission, we
match with the catalog of NLSy1 galaxies by Rakshit et al.
(2017). We find 55 matches within 5’ of BLAZE sources, the
maximum match radius used during the construction of the
“master” list, of which 37 are associated with candidates that
are also removed.

In order to identify other types of radio galaxies we match
with the high fidelity sample by Gordon et al. (2023) of dou-
ble radio sources, a morphology not expected to be observed for
blazars. We again use a maximum separation of 5”, identifying
1243 matches. More than 76% of these are associated with a
Hammerich et al.: BlazErl: The eROSITA Blazar Catalog

BROS source and overall 96.4% of the matches are blazar can-
didates. We also remove these as well.

Finally, we remove individual objects which are known to
be non-blazars. BROS JO729.1+2054 is the counterpart of the
Galactic planetary nebula NGC 2392. The nature of the source
A4FGL J0647.7—4418 is debated in the literature either as be-
ing a blazar (Marti et al. 2020) or a B-type subdwarf and
white dwarf binary (HD 49798 Mereghetti et al. 2009; Rigoselli
et al. 2023). The young radio galaxy PMN J1603—4904 (Miiller
et al. 2015; KrauB et al. 2018) is falsely classified in 4FGL
as the blazar 4FGL J1603.8—4903. Finally, the BZCAT cata-
log erroneously includes the radio galaxy Cen A as a blazar
(SBZU J1325—4301).

2.3. Release and comparison with other catalogs

After removing obvious non-blazars, 100368 out of the initial
103498 objects remain. We call our “master” list of blazars
and blazar candidates, the BLAZars from litErature catalog, or
BLAZE catalog. The BLAZE catalog can be split into a “gold
sample”, which includes 6301 confirmed blazars with or without
known type (3031 are located on the footprint of the eRASS1
survey), and a “silver sample” of 94067 candidates (38905 in
the footprint of the eRASS1 survey), containing the blazar can-
didates. Figure | shows the spatial distribution of the gold sam-
ple. Due to the general utility of a compilation of blazars for the
field, the BLAZE catalog catalog is published with this paper and
made available online on Vizier. The description of the BLAZE
catalog is given in Appendix C, as the catalog is enriched with
redshifts for the confirmed blazars and eROSITA exposure times
and upper limits for flux and luminosity. The list of the likely
non-blazar objects, referred to as the unverified BLAZE catalog,
is released as a separate file.

In comparison to previous studies we find 6307 individual
blazars from the 4FGL, Roma-BZCAT, and 3HSP catalogs, a
slightly different number than in earlier catalogs (5340 sources,
Giommi et al. 2019 and 6425 sources, Bellenghi et al. 2023).
To avoid source confusion, we apply a stricter angular limit for
cross-matching, leading to a difference between BLAZE and
Giommi et al. (2019) and Bellenghi et al. (2023). The devia-
tion of 15% between BLAZE and Giommi et al. (2019) is also
related to this estimate being based on the 3LAC catalog which
only contains 1591 sources in total compared to the 3934 in-
cluded in the 4FGL catalog. However, the deviation between the
BLAZE and Bellenghi et al. (2023) is only 2% mainly driven
by the exclusion of contaminants. Marchesi et al. (2025) found
1772 matches between the BZCAT and the 4FGL, of which 1725
are within 2”, while our analysis returns 1625 within 4” (1731
without quality cuts). This difference is ascribed to our match
radius, as Marchesi et al. (2025) also accept wider separations
for counterparts between the catalogs and our filtering. A total
of 615 out of 651 objects in the isotropic catalog of Kudenko &
Troitsky (2024) are contained in the BLAZE catalog, which in-
cludes 409 of the 433 blazars and blazar-like sources from the
isotropic catalog. The objects not contained simply do not have
a counterpart in Kudenko & Troitsky (2024; to within 6’). Out
of the matches, 204 are classified as quasars, AGN or based on
an emission band by Kudenko & Troitsky (2024) and 19 of these
are associated with blazar candidates in the BLAZE catalog.

3. Matching eROSITA to the BLAZE catalog

In this section we describe the construction of our eROSITA
blazar and blazar candidates catalog based on the BLAZE cat-

alog. Out of the 100368 blazar and blazar candidate sources in
the BLAZE catalog, 41936 are located on the western Galactic
hemisphere and are matched with eROSITA. We also assess the
level of contamination of the catalog and the analysis of the X-
ray data.

3.1. The eROSITA observed blazars and blazar candidates
3.1.1. X-Ray counterparts

To identify the X-ray counterparts of the BLAZE catalog, we
match the BLAZE catalog and the eRASS1 catalog positions
(Merloni et al. 2024). We use the BLAZE catalog and the
attitude-corrected positions from eROSITA, and only consider
point sources (EXT = 0.0, see Merloni et al. 2024), identifying
an initial number 8117 matches with angular separation <15”.
This separation limit is based on the accuracy of the astrometric
correction of eROSITA (Merloni et al. 2024) and the point spread
function of the eROSITA telescopes. The histogram of the angu-
lar distance in Fig. 2 shows that most matches are within the
positional accuracy of the matched eROSITA sources (shown in
yellow, the normalized version of the histogram is displayed in
Fig. A.1). About 84% of associations have an angular separa-
tion of 8” or less, and 38% and 64% of the sample are located
within 3” and 5’, respectively. The distributions of separations
for blazars and blazar candidates are different, the candidates ex-
hibit a broader peak, possibly due to contamination. Based on
the distribution of angular separation and in order to avoid un-
necessary source confusion and false identifications we conser-
vatively cut our final sample at a separation of 8’ between the
BLAZE and eRASS|1 source position. This cut reduces the sam-
ple to 6852 blazars and blazar candidates.

Since the eROSITA exposures are still quite low (~240s),
many sources have a low detection likelihood in eROSITA. To
avoid including possibly spurious detections, we remove all
matches with a detection likelihood, DET_LIKE_0 < 102,
which reduces the fraction of spurious sources to ~1%
(Seppi et al. 2022; Merloni et al. 2024). We also remove
all entries with uncertain positions, that is, without val-
ues for RA_LOWERR, RA_UPERR, DEC_LOWERR,
and DEC_UPERR in the eRASS1 catalog, and exclude
all objects where eROSITA quality flags indicate issues in
the source detection (FLAG_SP_SNR, FLAG_SP_BPS,
FLAG_SP_SCL, FLAG_SP_LGA, FLAG_SP_GC_CONS,
FLAG_NO_RADEC_ERR, FLAG_NO_CTS_ERR, and
FLAG_NO_EXT_ERR). Additionally, we remove all blazars
and blazar candidates with X-ray luminosities too low to
actually be a blazar (Lx02-23kev < 104! ergs~!), lowering
our contamination rate. This reduces the sample size to 5865
sources of which 2106 are associated with confirmed blazars,
and the remainder with blazar candidates. The normalized
separation distributions shown in Fig. A.1 clearly indicate
that after the applied cuts the agreement with the theoretical
Rayleigh distribution is significantly improved. Table 2 lists the
number of sources after each cut and for each blazar type, and
Fig. 3 displays the sky distribution of the final sample.

The matches outlined above are the basis for the Blazars in
eRASS1 (BlazEr1) catalog. This catalog combines X-ray and
multiwavelength information that we compiled for all catalog
sources. A detailed description of the content of the catalogs is
given in Appendix D. We will refer to the sample of sources de-

? DET_LIKE_0 equals the negative logarithm of the probability of de-
tected counts being caused by fluctuations of the background

tected by eROSITA and associated with “gold sample” BLAZE
sources as the eROSITA observed blazars, while we will name
eROSITA matches with an entry from the BLAZE “silver sam-
ple” the eROSITA observed blazar candidates. The 2252 objects
removed from the catalog are included in a separate catalog, as
this sample is expected to be less pure, but may be of value for
follow-up studies. Due to the survey mode of eROSITA, we are
able to obtain a view unbiased by variability, source luminosity
and only limited by eROSITA sensitivity variations and exposure
in eRASS1.

3.1.2. Validation of positional matching

Since our association of blazars with eROSITA sources is based
on positions, it is necessary to check whether our positional
matching is a valid approach. We use two independent meth-
ods to derive an upper limit on the possible contamination of
matching by pure chance.

We first estimate the possibility of randomly associating an
input position with an eRASS1 source by uniformly distribut-
ing 5 x 10° (which is five times larger but has the same order
of magnitude in numbers as the BLAZE catalog) sources at ran-
dom position on the entire sky and matching these positions to
the eRASS1 catalog. Within 8”, we find 346 matches whereas,
within 15” 1205 matches are found, indicating a probability for
random association of 0.07% and 0.24% for these separations,
respectively. Alternatively, conserving the density properties of

le. Nspec.new: Number of sources from the spectroscopic sub-sample without prior X-ray data

the eRASS1 survey we rotate the positions in the eRASS1 cat-
alog around the ecliptic poles by a few degrees in ecliptic lon-
gitude and then match them with the BLAZE catalog. For rota-
tions by 1° and 10°, 89 and 104 sources match within 15’, re-
spectively. When reducing the separation to 8”, only 34 and 23
matches remain, implying a random match probability of about
0.08% for a separation of < 8’, regardless of the applied rota-
tion.

Results from both methods suggest a probability below 0.1%
of accidental source confusion. Hence, we expect at most 42
eROSITA detections to be randomly assigned to BLAZE catalog
sources. Given the size of the BlazEr1 catalog, the rate of source
confusion is therefore at a negligible level of 0.7%. Our cross-
matching angular distance is well justified, as the loss of matches
when reducing the acceptable angular distance from 15” to 8”
indicates that the probability of including random matches drops
significantly. We emphasize that this low level of accidental
source confusion is due to us using pre-existing positions of ob-
jects with known multiwavelength properties, including a very
high probability that these sources are X-ray bright. This ap-
proach is different from approaches that attempt to find multi-
wavelength counterparts for new X-ray detected sources in mul-
tiwavelength catalogs, where little is known about the properties.
These approaches have a much higher probability of misidenti-
fying the multiwavelength counterparts.

lustrative purposes, calculated following Merloni et al. (2024; Eq. 3,
assuming F = 0.8).

3.2. Contamination

The sample size makes a study of the source nature on an indi-
vidual basis too time consuming. We therefore, try to asses upper
limits of the contamination. We derive the level of contamination
caused by non-blazars in the sample by comparing the BlazEr1
catalog with the catalog of Legacy Survey data release 10 (LS10;
Dey et al. 2019) counterparts of eRASS1 point sources (Salvato
et al. 2025; hereafter S25). This catalog is based on an identifica-
tion of optical counterparts with the Bayesian algorithm NWAY
(Salvato et al. 2018), using a combination of astrometric infor-
mation such as separation, positional error, and source number
density (similar to Xmatch; Pineau et al. 2017). The complete-
ness and purity of the LS10 catalog of counterparts to eRASS1
is ~93% (S25).

We match by using the detection ID of eRASS1. If more
than one possible counterpart is listed for a given ID, we use the
one with the closest position. In total, we can match 84% of the
BlazEr1 sources (4924 objects). We only consider counterparts
to be a match between both catalogs if the association of S25 and
the BlazEr1 catalog have an angular separation of at most 2”,

and if Pany = 0.1>. For 508 matches (10.3% of the sources with
a match based on detection ID) we associate a different coun-
terpart as S25 or Pany is very low. About 89% of the disagreed
upon objects are associated with blazar candidates and almost
80% originate from the BROS catalog. This leaves us with 4416
counterparts in common, which corresponds to a 90% agree-
ment. Therefore, when comparing with the results of S25 and as-
suming that their assigned counterparts to the eROSITA sources
are all correct, a disagreement between the counterpart by $25
and our catalog and hence a contamination of at maximum 3.3%
for the eROSITA observed blazars and 14.0% for the eROSITA
observed blazar candidates is expected. Sometimes the X-ray
source might be the sum of multiple emitters. This is the case
for 32 sources, of which in 22 cases the counterparts by S25 and
our source are identical. We also compare the matches obtained
by matching the unverified BLAZE catalog with eRASS1, using
the same methodology as for the BlazEr1 sample, with the coun-
terpart catalog. Given the same criteria as listed in Sect. 3.1, the
unverified BLAZE catalog has 491 matches with the eRASS1, of
which 397 have a counterpart in S25. For 33 of these matches, all
of them candidates, $25 assigns a different counterpart. There-
fore, a slightly lower but similar level (~ 8%) of contamination
is reached for this low quality sample as for the BlazEr1 catalog.
This also indicates that cleaning of the BLAZE catalog is useful.

For all eROSITA sources listed in the BlazEr1 and the coun-
terpart catalog, we compare the angular separation between the
eROSITA position and the counterpart by S25 with the separation
between the BLAZE catalog source and eROSITA, normalized

is the correct counterpart.

by the positional uncertainty of eROSITA. Some BlazEr1 coun-
terparts tend to be too far away as they lie significantly above
the theoretical Rayleigh distribution, whereas few counterparts
assigned by S25 seem to be closer or more distant than expected
(see Fig. A.2). This indicates that some BLAZE catalog objects
are erroneously associated to the eROSITA source or that some
of the associations of S25 might not be the correct counterpart.
The estimated number of contaminating sources based on the
assumption that S25 provides the correct counterpart and dis-
agreement indicates contamination therefore represents an up-
per limit. We also note that ours and Salvato et al.’s counter-
part associations methodologies differ significantly. While we
focus on selecting blazar specific objects using multiwavelength
information and pre-existing catalogs, Salvato et al.’s approach
has been fine-tuned towards general X-ray emitters, where non-
jetted AGN dominate the population of X-ray emitting extra-
galactic objects. However, an in-depth comparison between the
approaches is beyond the scope of this paper.

The contamination is mainly driven by the BLAZE catalog
selection function and not by random matches (see Sect. 3.1.2).
The most pessimistic estimates from the purities of the input cat-
alogs (see Sect. 2.2) and the comparisons with the counterpart
catalog indicate that the contamination for confirmed blazars is
at most 5%, and ~14% for the candidate blazars. The limit for
the confirmed blazars is based on the purity estimate of the BZ-
CAT by Xie et al. (2024), which has the highest impurity of the
confirmed blazar catalogs. Although sources are excluded from
the BLAZE catalog based on Xie et al. (2024), they do not pro-
vide a classification for all catalog entries. We therefore expect
the subsample not covered by Xie et al. (2024) in the BZCAT to
have a similar level of contamination as the overall catalog, and
since we do not have information available for all BZCAT ob-
jects we adapt the 5% limit as an upper limit for the entire sam-
ple of confirmed blazars. For the candidates the limit is based on
the contamination estimate based on the comparison with S25.
Therefore, at most 106 of the thought to be confirmed blazars
and 527 of the candidates are non-blazars. In total, less than 11%
of the BlazEr1 catalog is contaminated, corresponding to a purity
of almost 90%.

3.3. Survey sensitivity

Since the sensitivity of the eROSITA survey is not uniform across
the sky, it is crucial to determine the lowest flux sources that
could have been detected as a function of position and expo-
sure time. We use the official eROSITA mission simulator, SIXTE
(Dauser et al. 2019) to determine this sensitivity limit. Using
the as-flown eROSITA attitude of the first all-sky survey and a
diffuse foreground from ROSAT, we simulate eROSITA observa-
tions of 10° sources randomly and uniformly distributed across
the western Galactic hemisphere. Based on the expected blazar
spectrum averaged across the entire population, each source is
assigned an absorbed power law spectrum ([x = 2.0, Ny =
1 x 10?! cm~?), We vary the 0.2-2.3 keV flux between 1 x 107!6
and 1 x 107! ergem~? s~!, with 20000 random flux values per
flux decade. The simulated data are then sorted into event lists
for each eROSITA sky tile and processed using the official source
detection pipeline contained in the eROSITA data analysis soft-
ware eSASS (version 211214, Predehl et al. 2021; Brunner et al.
2022; Merloni et al. 2024). The processing yields a mock cata-
log containing information on the detection likelihood, exposure
times, and fluxes. To ensure the validity of the simulations, we
checked that all fluxes of the detected source are consistent with

the input values within uncertainties; and since this is the case
we use the input fluxes.

To estimate the completeness and sensitivity, we define the
survey as complete if, for a given exposure time and minimum
detection likelihood of 10, 95% of sources with a given flux are
detected. For a given minimum detection likelihood, we find that
we can approximate the minimum detectable flux by

2.14 x 10° ergem™* s“!, t9 = 13.908, Peens = 2.20, and
Fo = 2.02 x 107 ergem™* s~!. Combining Eq. (1) with the
eROSITA exposure map, we can determine the area of the sky
at which the survey is sensitive to a specific flux. We divide the
sky into equally-sized pixels with an area of 0.002 deg” and de-
termine the minimum flux within that pixel. Figure 4 shows that
the survey is complete on the whole western sky down to a flux
of Fx,02~23kev ~ 2X 10° ergcm™ s~!. For all sources with a
lower flux, corrections using the derived sensitivity will have to
be applied, for instance when deriving log N-log S -distributions.

3.4. X-ray spectral analysis

In order to gather information on the X-ray properties of our
sample, we complement the available eRASS1 catalog data
(Merloni et al. 2024) with spectral information, using eSASS
version 211214, HEASOFT version 6.30, and eROSITA event
processing version 020, which offers improved calibration com-
pared to the release version 010 used by Merloni et al. (2024).
While the processing version affects the quality of spectral prod-
ucts, it does not affect the source detection itself within the
Hammerich et al.: BlazEr1: The eROSITA Blazar Catalog

conservative selection criteria applied above. Tests with differ-
ent processing versions reveal that their influence on the overall
spectral fitting results does not change the overall results. We
extract source spectra from circular extraction regions centered
on each catalog source, scaling the extraction region radius, R,
on the maximum likelihood count rate for the 0.2—-2.3 keV band,
given by Merloni et al. (2024),

R=Nx(ML_RATE_1 [cts/s])” (2)

where N = 85’’443 and y = 0.284. Higher count rate sources re-
quire larger regions in order to include all source photons, how-
ever we require at least 23” and at maximum a region with a
radius of 200”. Background regions are annuli centered on the
source position, using Eq. 2 to scale the inner and outer ra-
dius. Specifically, for the inner radius we set N = 1817/963,
= 0.242, Rinnermin = 54”, and Rinnermax = 350”. For the
outer radius, N = 1063211, y = 0.282, Routermin = 280”, and
Routermax = 2200’. Within the background region we exclude
all neighboring eRASS1 sources, scaling the exclusion radius of
each source by their count rate. Spectra are then extracted from
event lists with the eSASS task srctool. Since eROSITA TM 5
and 7 are affected by light leaks (Predehl et al. 2021; Merloni
et al. 2024), these two modules require special treatment in our
analysis. Unless mentioned otherwise, for these TMs, only data
taken >1 keV were considered. For spectral analysis, we use the
Interactive Spectral Interpretation System (ISIS, version 1.6.2;
Houck & Denicola 2000) and quote all uncertainties at 90% con-
fidence for one independent parameter, unless stated otherwise.

For all sources, we collect basic source information such as
the total amount of source counts and on-axis exposure times.
Count information is given as the number of photons detected
by all TMs for the 0.2-2.3 keV band, or as the combination of
counts measured between 1.0-10.0keV for TMs 5 and 7 and
0.2-10.0keV for all other TMs. We utilize the Bayesian ap-
proach of Park et al. (2006) to determine hardness ratios,

Nita — Nso
HR = ————

Nita + Noo" °
, where Ng, and Ny, are the counts in the softer and harder band,
respectively, and their uncertainties. We ignore TMs 5 and 7, and
use the energy bands 0.2-0.7 keV, 0.7—1.2 keV, and 1.2-5.0 keV,
hereafter bands 1, 2, and 3. For an absorbed power law with
Nu = 1 x 107! cm~ and photon index I'y = 2, these bands con-
tain a similar number of photons. The different hardness ratios
are designated as follows: HR12 is the hardness calculated using
bands 1 and 2, HR23 uses bands 2 and 3, and HR13 bands 1 and
3,

The source fluxes reported in the eRASS1 catalogs are de-
termined as part of the eROSITA source detection pipeline.
They are based on maximum likelihood methods, applying pre-
determined energy conversion factors assuming an absorbed
power law with xy = 2.0 and an absorption column density of
Ny = 3 X 10?°cm~?. We determine source intrinsic fluxes for
the 0.2—2.3 keV band based on spectral modeling with fixed pa-
rameters. We use simple absorbed power laws thabs*powerlaw
(tbabs(1)*powerlaw(1)"), with the abundances of Wilms
et al. (2000) and the cross-sections of Verner et al. (1996) and
fix the equivalent hydrogen column, Ny, to the 21 cm value for
the source position reported by the HI4PI Collaboration (2016).
We then determine the 0.2-2.3 keV fluxes from fits of the spec-
tral continuum to the full eROS/TA energy range from 0.2 keV
(1keV for TMS and 7) to 10.0keV for four fixed photon in-
dices, Ix, covering the range expected from blazar-like spectra
Tx = (1.5, 1.7, 2.0, 2.3}.

Fig. 5. Spectral fits of an absorbed power law model for three confirmed
blazars with different fluxes. For SBZQ J0547—6728, no prior X-ray ob-
servations are available. The three lower panels display the fit residuals
for each source. Data from TMS and 7 are displayed in a lighter color.

For the 1273 sources with more than 50 counts detected in
the 0.2-2.3 keV band, we also perform a more detailed spec-
tral analysis, again using an absorbed power law. For these, we
dynamically rebin each spectrum following Kaastra & Bleeker
(2016), while requiring that each bin contains at least one count,
leave the photon index free, and fix Ny to the 21cm value
from the HI4PI Collaboration (2016). Spectral minimization is
based on Cash statistics (Cash 1979; Kaastra 2017). Figure 5
shows the spectra of three blazars with our best fit model. The
fluxes derived from the fixed photon index power law fits, those
determined during the spectral fits, and the ones reported by
Merloni et al. (2024) are all similar within ~18%. For high
fluxes (>Fx,0.2-23kev ~ 107!! ergem7? s~!; Merloni et al. 2024)
eROSITA spectra are influenced by pileup (see, e.g., KGnig et al.
2022); we proceeded to check for pile-up in these sources. Using
SIXTE to simulate blazar-like spectra within different flux ranges
(also above the flux limit reported by Merloni et al. 2024) we
find that our spectra are not significantly affected by pileup, with
a maximum pileup fraction of 1.79% for the brightest source.

4. Additional multiwavelength data

In order to put the properties of the BlazErl catalog into the
multiwavelength context of these sources, we supplement the
eROSITA information with data from other X-ray and multi-
wavelength catalogs.

4.1. Observations of eROSITA blazars with other X-ray
missions

To collect soft X-ray flux and spectral information, we cross-
match the BlazErl with the ROSAT (0.1-2.4keV, Boller et al.
2016) and the Swift-XRT (0.3-10.0keV) source catalogs by
Giommi et al. (2019; OUSXB DR3) and Evans et al. (2020).
Although both catalogs use Swift-XRT, they were compiled in-
dependently and using different approaches. The OUSXB cat-
alog specifically targets blazars and treats each single observa-
tion separately, whereas Evans et al. (2020) merge all exposures
of a given target. BlazErl counterparts are again identified by
positional cross-matching, using a maximum angular separation
between the BlazEr1 position and ROSAT of 40” and of 8” be-
tween BlazErl and Swift-XRT. We find 1496 ROSAT and 1249
Swift-XRT (for Evans et al. 2020) counterparts. As the OUSXB
catalog is built on an observation basis with one entry per ob-
servation, we first match it with the BLAZE catalog. For each of
the 1039 matches we then derive the mean, median, minimum,
and maximum fluxes and spectral indices from all source visits.

In order to get information at higher energies, we cross-
match the BlazErl with the NuSTAR (3.0-10.0keV, 10.0-
30.0 keV) blazar catalog (Middei et al. 2022), using a maximum
angular separation of 8” (based on the positional accuracy of
NuSTAR; Harrison et al. 2013), identifying 46 out of 126 sources.
Since this catalog contains one entry per observation, we include
the fluxes and spectral information of the observation closest
in time to eRASS1 to the BlazErl catalog. We also matched
our detections with the Swift-BAT catalog (14.0-195.0 keV, Lien
et al. 2025), assuming a maximum angular separation of 60”,
and where available using the positions of already known coun-
terparts, obtaining 96 matches, for which we add the flux and
spectral information to the BlazEr1.

To identify objects with previous observations, we cross-
match BlazEr1 with the observation catalogs of XMM-Newton,
Chandra, ASCA, NuSTAR, Suzaku, Swift-XRT, and ROSAT
available at HEASARC *. BlazEr1 contains the total exposure
time for each source and mission.

4.2. The y-ray counterparts of eROSITA blazars

The Large Area Telescope (LAT; Atwood et al. 2009) onboard
the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (0.1—-100.0 GeV, 1.0-
100.0 GeV) has been observing the entire sky in the y-ray band
since 2008. We use the y-ray counterparts from the fourth data
release of the Fermi-LAT Fourth Source catalog (4FGL-DR4;
Abdollahi et al. 2020, 2022) listed in the BLAZE catalog, in
total obtaining 1293 matches. We additionally collect flux and
spectral information, source classifications, and SED peak po-
sitions provided by the third data release of the Fourth Catalog
of Active Galactic Nuclei Detected by Fermi-LAT (4LAC-DR3;
Ajello et al. 2020, 2022). For the comparison with the 4LAC cat-
alog we use a positional match between the BlazEr1 catalog and
the position of the associated counterparts listed in the catalog

+ https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/W 3Browse/w3browse.pl

Article number, page 10 of 39

with a maximum separation of 1’, since it is based on an older
4FGL version as the one used for this paper.

4.3. Radio counterparts to eROSITA blazars

We search for radio counterparts using Very Long Baseline In-
terferometry (VLBI) programs, since this implies that all flux
lensities are representative for the beamed compact jet rather
than extended lobe emission. Counterparts from the Radio Fun-
jamental Catalog (RFC, version rfc_2023c, Petrov & Kovalev
2025)° are identified using a maximum angular separation of
1’, since radio positional uncertainties are low. We find 2620
matches. Additionally, we cross-match the BlazEr1 catalog with
the blazars covered by the TANAMI (8.4 GHz, 59 sources; Ojha
et al. 2010; Miiller et al. 2018) and MOJAVE (15 GHz, 407 sources
Lister et al. 2021; Homan et al. 2021) surveys. We use the flux
lensity values that are already public, since an extensive investi-
gation involving the more current data is beyond the scope of this
paper. With a separation of at most 1” we find 52 TANAMI and
97 MOJAVE blazars within the BlazErl catalog. We assume flux
lensity uncertainties of 5% for RFC (Petrov & Kovalev 2025)
and MOJAVE (Homan et al. 2002; Lister et al. 2021), and 20% for
TANAMI (Ojha et al. 2010).

4.4. Infrared and optical counterparts to eROSITA sources

We gather counterpart optical and mid-infrared data (bands: g
(4686 A), r (6165 A), i (7481 A), z (8931 A), WI (3.4m), W2
(4.6 um), W3 (12 um), and W4 (22 um)) from $25. Additionally,
the catalog provides the publicly available spectroscopic red-
shifts from Kluge et al. (2024), photometric redshifts for AGN
computed with CIRCLEZ (Saxena et al. 2024), and other mul-
tiwavelength information. Gaia information is also contained in
the catalog from S25, however, the astrometric data are not used
here since the proper motions and parallaxes listed for the bright-
est and well studied blazars (such as 3C 273) would indicate
a Galactic origin, which also enters the Galactic/extragalactic
classification in S25. This error in Gaia is associated with the
variability of these objects (Khamitov et al. 2022). We only use
the data for the 4416 sources where the BlazErl and the S25
catalogs agree with each other on the eRASS1 counterpart (for
details, see Sect. 3.2).

In order to obtain reliable redshifts for population studies we
augment the BLAZE and BlazEr1 catalogs with redshifts given
in the HighZ sample (Sbarrato et al., in prep., Marcotulli et al.
2025) and the 4LAC (Ajello et al. 2022). If no redshift is given
in these two catalogs we extend the catalogs to using un—flagged
redshifts from the BZCAT (redshifts not considered to be spu-
rious by Massaro et al. 2015), confirmed and reliable redshifts
from the 3HSP (Chang et al. 2019), and redshifts from CGRaBS
(Healey et al. 2008), VERONCAT (Véron-Cetty & Véron 2010),
SIMBAD (Wenger et al. 2000) and spectroscopic redshifts from
$25, prioritizing redshifts in the order of catalogs listed here.
For the high-redshift source BROS J1322.1—1323 we use the
redshift reported by Belladitta et al. (2025), where the eRASS1
counterpart given in the BlazEr1 catalog has been previously re-
ported.

> This leads to seven candidates having 4LAC parameter values as
well, however, given the size of the catalog these data points can be
ignored and do not influence our results in any way.

4.5. Broadband spectral indices

We calculate an estimated spectral index for a power law be-
tween different SED bands (e.g., Stocke et al. 1991; Perlman
et al. 1996a; Giommi et al. 1999; Turriziani et al. 2007),

erence energies E; and E; is

og E; — log E;
where S; = S(E£;) and S; = S(Ej) are the flux densities at a
specific energy (£;, Ej). For the X-rays we use the 1 keV flux
density found from power law fits with Ty = 2.0 and a fixed
value of Ny, since this flux estimate is available for all catalog
sources. We computed ar based on the 0.1-100 GeV y-ray flux
from Abdollahi et al. (4FGL-DR4; 2022), assuming the geomet-
ric mean between the energy band boundaries as reference en-
ergy (0.1 GeVx100.0 GeV)!/. For values of aygx we utilized the
dereddened W1-band flux, whereas for aox we used the dered-
dened LS10 r-band flux, both based on the transmission and flux
values taken from $25. We account for the uncertainty of dust
models in the dereddening (according to Fitzpatrick 1999) by
applying a 20% systematic uncertainty to our estimate for the
transmission. This estimate is based on the different transmis-
sion factors obtained when assuming Ry = 2.7 or Ry = 3.1 in
the extinction law. We also provide a set values of @px, deter-
mined using the RFC X-band (8.6 GHz), TANAMI (8.4 GHz; Ojha
et al. 2010; Miiller et al. 2018) and MOJAVE (15 GHz; Lister et al.
2021; Homan et al. 2021) flux densities. Uncertainties for the
a-values were estimated using Gaussian error propagation and
68% confidence intervals.

5. The BlazEr1 catalog results and discussion

The steps outlined in Sects. 3 and 4 lead to the construction of the
BlazEr1 catalog. We also performed the same steps for objects
which do not match our selection criteria (Sect. 3.1.1). These
discarded sources are included in a supplementary catalog (see
Appendix D for the catalog description). This sample — referred
to as the unverified sample — contains 2252 objects, which we
provide as a courtesy, but do not discuss further.

In this section, we discuss the main BlazEr1 results, focusing
first on eROSITA X-ray results, and then presenting the multi-
wavelength picture. We also address non-detected sources here.

5.1. Global properties of the BlazEr1 catalog

The BlazEr1 catalog contains 5865 individual blazars and blazar
candidates observed and detected with eROSITA. Of these, 2106
are associated with a confirmed blazar, while the remaining are
blazar candidates. We detect roughly the same number of sources
for each blazar subtype, with 597 BLLs, 769 FSRQs and 712
BCUs, and also find 28 BZGs. The blazar candidates are domi-
nated by BCUCs (1892 sources, ~50% of the candidates), while
the remainder is composed of 25% BLLCs and 24% FSROCs
(954 and 913, respectively). The origin of the BCUC popula-
tion is dominated by the BROS catalog. The sky map (Fig. 3)
shows a roughly evenly distributed extragalactic distribution of
objects. There are 5296 sources at Galactic latitudes |b] > 15°,
corresponding to an area density of 0.346 sources/deg”.

Fig. 6. Distribution of source counts with its cumulative distribution
shown by the solid line curve. The dashed vertical line marks the thresh-
old of 50 counts, above which we deem a spectral analysis meaningful.
Only 20% of all sources are above this limit, while about half have fewer
than 20 counts, as shown by the cumulative distribution (blue).

In total, the catalog is based on 487030 X-ray photons in
the 0.2-2.3 keV band. Most sources in the catalog have very few
counts (median value: 18 counts; see Fig. 6). During eRASS1,
eROSITA detected more than 50 counts per source for about
20% of the BlazEr1 objects (i.e., 1273 sources), which we se-
lect for a spectral analysis. 4FGL JO543.9-5531 has the most
counts with 26819 counts. This source has flux of Fx,9.2-2.3kev =
4.9 x 107! erg cm™ s~!, which is increased by a factor of about
two (Fx,03-100Kev = 4.5 x 107! ergcm-? s-!; Giommi et al.
2019) to six (Fx,0,1-24kev = 9.0 x 107! ergcem~? s~! Massaro
et al. 2015) compared to past observations. The long exposure
time of 584s, given the position of the source, explains the high
number of counts compared to equally bright sources. About half
of the detections have fewer than 20 counts, with some being reg-
istered with only three counts in the eROSITA main band (0.2—
2.3 keV).

A vital characteristic of the sample is the sources’ flux dis-
tribution. Unless stated otherwise, for consistency and as not to
mix different flux determination methods and since we do not
expect robust spectral fitting to be possible for the majority of
sources (<50 counts), we study the properties of the blazar pop-
ulation in this section using the unabsorbed source intrinsic flux
in the 0.2-2.3 keV band measured assuming a fixed photon in-
dex of Ty = 2.0 and the 21cm Ny at the source position. We
use fluxes assuming [x = 2.0 since this is the expected pho-
ton index obtained when averaging across the entire population.
Fluxes determined with other values for a fixed photon index
(Ix = {1.5, 1.7, 2.3}) agree to within 9.1%. The fluxes from the
eRASS1 catalog (Merloni et al. 2024) are consistent within the
uncertainties, with an average deviation of 18%, which might
be due to the different treatment of absorption and flux de-
termination (on average the Ny from the HI4PI Collaboration
(2016) is higher than the one assumed by Merloni et al. 2024).
The measured fluxes span a range of almost four decades; the
brightest source is 3C 273 (4FGL J1229.0+0202, Fx,0.2-2.3kev =
6.2 x 107! ergcm™? s~!, with an exposure time of 111s and
7179 counts), the faintest is WIBRaLS2 J045646.58—585411.7
(Fx,02-23kev = 6.9 x 107 ergem™ s“!, with an exposure of
867s and 13 counts).

Fig. 7. Flux distribution in the BlazEr| catalog. The majority of sources
have fluxes below the survey completeness limit on the western Galactic
hemisphere, the vertical line marks this limit. The cumulative distribu-
tion is shown in blue.

About half of the sources in the BlazErl catalog are
brighter than the flux level where completeness is reached
across the western Galactic hemisphere, Fx,92-23xev = 2 X
107!3 ergcm= s~! (see Sect. 3.3 and Fig. 7). Fainter sources are
located in parts of the sky where eROSITA has deeper exposure.

Reliable redshifts z, are available for 3627 catalog objects
(Fig. 8). Including the S25 photometric redshifts increases the
number of available values to 4795. The majority of blazars
and blazar candidates are found at z < 2. The sample contains
155 sources with z > 2.5, including objects up to z ~ 6, such as
the high-redshift blazar candidate BROS J1322.1—1323 (Bella-
ditta et al. 2025; z = 4.71). Among these z > 2.5 sources, we
report the first X-ray detection of the blazar 5BZQ J1007+1356,
which was identified as a y-ray emitter by Kreter et al. (2020)
during an a posteriori search for transient y-ray signals from
high-z blazars. Out of the 87 blazars on the western Galactic
hemisphere studied by Kreter et al. (2020), eROSITA detects
61 sources. Consistent with previous results (Ajello et al. 2012,
2014, 2020), the observed distribution of redshifts indicates that
BLLs tend to be at low z, while FSRQs peak towards z ~ 1.0.
BCUs can be found at all redshifts.

Several remarkable eROS/TA-detected blazars __lo-
cated in the early Universe are not part of BlazErl.
eRASSU J020916-562650 is one of the most distant blazars
known (z = 5.6; Wolf et al. 2024), but was not detected in
eRASS1, only in subsequent surveys in eRASS2, eRASS3,
and eRASS4 (the name of the source deviates from the
name used by Wolf et al. 2024). The z = 6.19 quasar
CFHQS J142952+544717, which was detected in the first
eROSITA survey (Medvedev et al. 2020), is located on the
eastern Galactic hemisphere. Recent observations with Chandra
and NuSTAR revealed rapid variability, identifying it as a
likely blazar (Marcotulli et al. 2025). Similarly, the blazars
TXS 1508+572 (z = 4.3) and GB6 142844217 (z = 4.7), which
have shown remarkably luminous y-ray flaring events in recent
years (Gokus et al. 2024a; Gokus et al. 2025), are also located
on the eastern Galactic hemisphere.

In order to assess the quality of the photometric redshifts by
$25 we compare them to the reliable literature (spectroscopic
and photometric from, for instance, the BZCAT or 4LAC cata-
logs) redshifts where both parameters are available. For almost

resent different sub-types. All BlazErl entries are shown in green
(3627 sources), BLLs in blue, and FSRQs in orange. The inset shows
the distribution for sources with z > 3.5.

67% of the sources the difference in redshift is > 10%. We there-
fore limit our population study involving distance-dependent
properties (such as e.g., luminosity) to objects with reliable lit-
erature redshifts and omit the photometric redshifts of S25.

5.2. Luminosity distributions of eROSITA detected blazars

We derive rest-frame luminosities for the 0.2-2.3keV band,
Lxo2-23xev. Not surprisingly, the luminosity of the detected
blazars increases with redshift, and the catalog is also biased to-
wards higher luminosities due to the flux limit while sampling
a larger volume. This bias becomes evident when comparing
with other missions (see Fig 9). The NuSTAR sample of Middei
et al. (2022) tends to contain sources with higher luminosities
and fluxes, covering similar values as eROSITA. Additionally,
with the NuSTAR sample it can be seen that blazars are highly
variable. Due to the lower sensitivity of the Swift-BAT sample
(Marcotulli et al. 2022), luminosities from that sample are biased
towards high luminosities, as only high-flux sources are part of
this sample. The comparison with these hard X-ray samples in-
dicates that eROSITA samples intermediate luminosities between
the shallow all-sky hard X-ray samples and deeper surveys, and
also extends to higher redshifts (see above).

The median luminosity for all objects is Lxo2-23kev ~
7.3 x 10 erg s~!. Confirmed blazars show slightly higher lumi-
nosities, due to a tail towards lower luminosities apparent in the
luminosity distributions (Fig. 10). On average FSRQs are more
luminous by almost an order of magnitude compared to BLLs
and BCUs, which have similar values. The median values for all
source subgroups are given in Table 3. Since redshifts are more
difficult to determine for BLLs, luminosities are available for
more FSRQs than BLLs. The luminosities inferred with eROSITA
are consistent with previous studies (e.g., Donato et al. 2001; Fan
et al. 2012). Overall, luminosities determined for blazar candi-
dates agree with those of confirmed blazars and no stark dif-
ference is found between y-detected and non-detected sources.
Kolmogoroy-Smirnov tests indicate that most distributions differ
significantly at the 95% confidence level, all combinations result

The low-energy peak frequencies of the LSPs (as identified
in the 4LAC) increase with decreasing luminosity. For HSPs and
ISPs no significant trend is observed. This observation is consis-
tent with the origin of the X-rays within the SED coming from
different processes, and with the blazar sequence.

In Fig. 11 we show the distribution of hardness ratios (see
Sect. 3.4 for the definition) based on the source counts of the

softer spectra for BLLs (blue) in comparison to FSRQs (red). The
obtained hardness ratios have values expected if sources have ab-
sorbed power law spectra. Sources in Fig. 11 cluster towards the
left of the diagrams and the tracks, therefore most objects are
consistent with lower Ny, as expected for the blazar population.

5.4. Photon indices

For the 1273 blazars with > 50 counts, more detailed informa-
tion about the spectral shape is available from our spectral fits
(Sect. 3.4). Figure 12 shows probability distributions of the pho-
ton indices of all of these sources as well as for the various sub-
classes, taking into account the (sometimes large) uncertainties
of the spectral fits. The distributions are approximately Gaus-
sian; Table 4 lists the results from fitting Gaussian functions to
the distributions. In order to see how similar the distributions are,
we performed KS-tests on all the possible combinations, requir-
ing a 95% confidence level. In some cases subsamples from the
BlazEr1 catalog are likely to have the same underlying distribu-
tion and we list the p-values for those. All not listed combina-
tions have different underlying distributions (p < 0.05).

The distribution of X-ray photon indices of the whole sam-
ple peaks at around Ix = 2.0. This is observed for the candi-
dates as well, indicating that a sufficient fraction of these can-
didates have X-ray spectra similar to blazars. A clear separation
is seen between FSRQs and BLLs. Consistent with the blazar
sequence (Fossati et al. 1998), FSRQs with a higher luminosity
peak at lower energies due to more efficient cooling (Ghisellini
et al. 1998; see Fig. 12b), resulting in harder X-ray spectra with
a higher chance of the emission not being part of the low energy
SED peak compared to BLLs. BCUs are overall similar to all
confirmed blazars (p = 0.707), confirming their blazar nature.
In Fig. 12c, we compare confirmed blazars detected in y rays
to those not detected in y rays, noting that the distributions are
quite similar. We find no difference between sources detected in
the 4FGL and the overall (including those from the 4FGL cat-
alog and those not detected in y rays) distribution of confirmed
blazars (p = 0.429) or BCUs (p = 0.138). Confirmed blazars
with no y-ray detection have similar photon indices as the overall
candidate distributions (p = 0.648), those of the BLLC (= 0.280)
and BCUC (p = 0.589) classes and the BCUs (p = 0.076). The
distributions of the 4FGL and non-4FGL confirmed blazars do
not originate from the same underlying distribution (p < 0.001).
This is also observed for the BLLs (p = 0.093) and BCUs
(p = 0.972) sub-classes, however, we find no difference between
the y-ray detected and the non-detected FSRQs (p = 0.008). Al-
though the X-ray photon indices of y-ray detected and non-y-ray
detected sources have very similar values, consistent with previ-
ous studies (e.g., Yuan & Fan 2014), the comparison of the dis-
tribution indicates different distributions, with the exception of
FSRQs. A possible reason is Compton dominance and the gen-
eral decoupling of X-rays and y rays due to the different physical
mechanisms. Figure 12d compares the power law slopes of dif-
ferent candidate populations. Although FSROCs exhibit slightly
harder spectra, the distributions of FSRQCs, BLLCs (which is
similar to the confirmed distribution p = 0.705 and to BCUs
p = 0.701), and BCUCs are more similar than for the confirmed
objects. The BCUC distribution is similar to the other candi-
date sub-classes (p = 0.066 for BLLCs, and 0.064 for FSRQCs).
Potentially this is due to an uncertain source classification. All
candidates are similar to the BLLCs (p = 0.198), and BCUCs
(p = 0.893).

Figure |2e shows the photon index by SED type. LSP blazars
tend to have indices below Tx < 2.0, indicating a rising X-
ray spectrum, HSPs have photon indices x 2 2.0, therefore
the X-rays are part of the synchrotron peak. ISPs peak around
Tx ~ 2.0. We emphasize again that all distributions have a large
overlap with each other, indicating again that I alone is not a
good measure of source type. As expected, FSRQs and LSPs
have the same underlying photon index distribution (p = 0.272),

whereas the HSPs and BLLs share similar values (p = 0.569),
which is also the case for the ISPs (p = 0.680), which also ex-
hibit a similar distribution as the HSPs (p = 0.841).

It is interesting to compare our average X-ray photon indices
for the different blazar types with those derived previously. Ta-
ble 4 lists a few literature values. Our results are consistent with
the previous studies, despite these samples being significantly
smaller. Comparing our values to the larger sample by Giommi
et al. (2019) we notice that their distributions peak at different
positions (Giommi et al. 2019; their Fig. 10); eROSITA spectra
are slightly softer. We see an overall trend that FSRQs and BLLs
show different spectral slopes, which is also observed in the lit-
erature (e.g. Giommi et al. 2019).

In our study, we also observe the split between FSRQs and
BLLs in the distribution of I with flux (Fig. 13a). BLLs tend to
have higher indices as well as higher fluxes, while FSRQs tend to
show a harder index but extending towards lower fluxes. In the
entire sample, we detect no correlation between flux and pho-
ton indices for the entire sample or any sub sample with the
exception of BLLs showing a very weak but statistically sig-
nificant anticorrelation® (see Table B.1 for correlations coeffi-
cients). Figure 13b shows I as a function of luminosity. These
parameters seem to be anti-correlated, as sources with harder
spectra have higher luminosities, a trend already described by
Kadler (2005). The anticorrelation is strongest for the FSRQs;
all other sub samples have less statistically significant anticorre-
lations and some are not statistically significant at all. This ob-
servation is consistent with the blazar sequence, where FSROs
tend to have higher luminosities and harder indices, as the X-
rays are more likely to originate from inverse Compton emis-
sion. BLLs tend to display lower luminosities and softer indices,
which has already been described in the literature (e.g., Fan et al.
2012). Despite the higher X-ray luminosity of FSRQs, the high-
est observed fluxes (>5 x 107! ergcm~? s~!) are almost exclu-
sively from BLLs due to their prevalence at lower redshifts. Ad-
ditionally, the hard spectral index of FSRQs makes it easier to
detect low-flux FSRQs, while BLLs with very soft spectra and
low fluxes are likely underrepresented due to the detection lim-
its. This indicates a bias in our sample towards high-flux BLLs.
For BLLs no correlation exists between the photon index and
the redshift of the source, while for FSRQs we find increasingly
hard spectra and high luminosities with increasing redshift. A
similar observation is made for the FSRQCs. These results re-
semble those of Giommi et al. (2019), and are due to a selection
effect.

for the absorption used (Ny = 1 x 10?! cm™!). In order to avoid
contamination by Galactic point sources and those in neighbor-
ing galaxies, we exclude regions at Galactic latitudes |b] < 15°
and circular regions of radius 5°5 and 3°0 around the Large and
Small Magellanic Clouds, respectively (Fig. 4, blue line). We
also, due to the large uncertainties, exclude all sources fainter
than Fx,02-2.3kev ~ 6 X 107! ergem~ s~!, such that 4785 ob-
jects are included for the log N-log S calculation, including 1804
blazars (519 BLLs, 682 FSRQs, and 575 BCUs), and 2981 blazar
candidates.

using the correction obtained from the simulation. These un-
corrected distributions stress how important it is to take the

tion, or “dip”, in the distribution at fluxes around Fx, 9.2-2.3kev ~
1x10-'' ergcm~? s~!. Tests with different selection criteria, such
as restricting the sources to the common footprint of the BLAZE
catalog input catalogs, do not remove this feature. Based on the
simulation presented in Sect. 3.3, however, we can exclude it to
be due to eROSITA’s sensitivity, as the feature is not present in
the simulated data, which uses the as-flown eROSITA attitude.
Computing log N-log S distributions for various ecliptic latitude
bins for the eRASS1 catalog results in noisier distributions in this
particular flux range, which is characterized by a small number
of objects. The deviation from a smooth function becomes more
pronounced, and we therefore conclude that this feature is most
likely due to small number statistics, possibly in combination
with source inhomogeneities in the sky, as also documented by
Merloni et al. (2024; Sect. 5.5).

In order to compare our results to the only available predic-
tions for the X-ray band for the log N-log S of blazars (Giommi
& Padovani 2015), we convert all fluxes to the 0.3-3.5 keV
band. Our log N-log S distributions agree quite well with the-
oretical expectations and agree in terms of the slope. Giommi
& Padovani (2015) did not assume the blazar sequence but the
blazar-simplified view, which provides a reasonable explanation
for the observed log N-log S distribution. However, no defini-
tive statement about whether the blazar sequence or the blazar-
simplified view is true can be made, as the overall results are
consistent with both scenarios. A detailed investigation is be-
yond the scope of this paper. Assuming that the blazar candi-
dates are indeed predominantly blazars, the incompleteness of
the BlazErl catalog at high fluxes is low with respect to the
prediction by Giommi et al. (2019). At the highest fluxes the
prediction is lower than the observed log N-log S distribution.
This discrepancy is caused by the 20 brightest blazars, which are
predominantly BLLs. After cross-checking the fluxes with the
unpublished eRASS2 data, we can rule out flaring as the cause
of this feature. Fluxes this high are not covered by Giommi &
Padovani (2015). Since the number of sources in this flux regime
is negligible the discrepancy at high fluxes is due to small num-
ber statistics and thus not relevant to the overall result.

We find that confirmed blazars dominate the source numbers
in the high-flux regime, with a similar trend as in the combined
log N-log S distribution, with incompleteness inducing a devia-
tion from the prediction at fluxes below 2 x 107!’ ergem=? s~!.
At low fluxes, the blazar candidates dominate. Likely most or
all blazars with high fluxes have already been identified, unlike
those at low fluxes, which are therefore included in the candidate
catalogs used to build the BLAZE catalog. We can also compare
the distributions of the subtypes of confirmed blazars and find
that incompleteness effects are seen at lower fluxes, with respect
to the predictions by Giommi & Padovani (2015). At high fluxes
the BLLs agree quite well with their prediction. For FSRQs the
log N-log S is found below the theoretical curve but the slopes
are consistent. For the BCUs, the log N-log S distribution for
most part lies above that of FSRQs. All these sources either be-
long to the BLL or FSRQ type but have not been identified yet,
explaining parts of the observed incompleteness (the majority of
BCUs are thought be BLLs; Kang et al. 2019; Pefia-Herazo et al.
2020; Chiaro et al. 2021). Giommi & Padovani (2015) also pre-
dict a population inversion between BLLs and FSRQs at a flux

of Fx,03-35kev = 1X 10-8 erg cm? st, resulting from the dif-

dictions of Giommi & Padovani (2015) for

ferent slopes, which is related to the evolution and distribution
of the source classes in the Universe. Such an inversion is seen
in the data as well, although at a slightly higher flux, albeit this
iscrepancy could be due to the incompleteness of our data and
other causes can not be ruled out as well.

An earlier comparison by Turriziani et al. (2019) of data
with the Giommi & Padovani (2015) predictions shows a sim-
ilar shape in log N-log S, although due to incompleteness their
log N-log S distribution lies below the prediction. Candidates in-
cluded by Turriziani et al. (2019) resulted in distributions above
the log N-log S expectation, therefore indicating that the candi-
lates included might be contaminated by other sources. This ob-
servation is not reproduced here, indicating that the candidates
in the BLAZE catalog are predominantly bazars with low con-
tamination from other source classes.

The slopes of log N-log S distributions have implications for
the cosmological evolution of blazars (e.g., Maccacaro et al.
1987; Langejahn et al. 2020; Marcotulli et al. 2022). A slope of
a = 1.5 implies no cosmological evolution, that is, the sources
are uniformly distributed in the Universe. Less steep slopes indi-
cate a negative cosmological evolution, where sources are more
common in the local Universe and their density declines with in-
creasing redshift. On the other hand steeper slopes correspond to
a positive evolution and more or brighter sources at higher red-
shifts than in the local Universe. We determine slopes for all the
observed distributions, taking flux uncertainties into account by
using a Monte-Carlo approach and assuming that fluxes follow a
normal distribution. We fit a power law in the form of

to the 0.2-2.3 keV log N-log S distribution’, limiting ourselves
to fluxes Fx,92-23kev = 3X 10-? ergem™ s! to avoid incom-
pleteness effects. The resulting parameters are listed in Table 5
and the best-fit functions are shown in Fig. A.3. The normal-
ization for the best fit to the BLLs is too low compared to the
observed distribution, an effect due to the flattening caused by
incompleteness, beaming effects (Marcotulli et al. 2022), and
the low number of sources at high fluxes; however, the slope
matches well. All measured slopes are below or close to 1.5,
therefore we find almost all subtypes and the overall eROSITA
observed blazars to be consistent with negative cosmological

evolution. For the blazar candidates the slope is close to no evo-
lution at all or a slightly positive one. As the log N-log S dis-
tribution possible shows breaks, we also considered a broken
power law as a fit function for the entire sample using the same
fit approach. One possible break is found at Fx break, 0.2-2.3keV =
(2.11 + 0.26) x 107! ergcm~? s~!, although a second less sig-
nificant solutions exits with the break at a slightly smaller flux
value. The position of the break could coincide with the flux re-
gion in which FSRQs start to be detected but is also close to the
previously described dip and could therefore be a survey effect
not related to blazars at all. Specific modeling of the log N-log S
and an analysis of the cosmological evolution of blazars, which
would require a very detailed study of the luminosity function
and modeling it with different evolutionary scenarios, is beyond
the scope of this paper.

Older studies were based on comparably few sources, reduc-
ing the significance of some conclusions. Previous work has in-
dicated a positive evolution for FSRQs (Wolter & Celotti 2001;
Toda et al. 2017; Turriziani et al. 2019; Marcotulli et al. 2022).
For BLLs, different trends have been observed, depending on the
underlying source sample. Slightly positive to no evolution has
been found for BLLs of the LSP type (Stickel et al. 1991). HSPs
have been found to be consistent with negative evolution (Rector
et al. 2000). In hard X-ray selected samples, FSRQs are found to
evolve positively, whereas BLLs show no or negative evolution
(Ajello et al. 2009; Toda et al. 2017; Marcotulli et al. 2022). For
y-ray selected samples BLLs also follow a positive evolution,
with the exception of HSPs, which show a negative evolution
(Ajello et al. 2014). However, the slope reported by Langejahn
et al. (2020) for a radio selected Swift-BAT sample is close to the
one reported in our work, indicating a negative evolution as well.
The hard X-ray log N-log S by Langejahn et al. (2020) shows
a significant difference in slope than their radio input sample.
Langejahn et al. attribute this to different evolution of the X-ray
and radio emission, with the former having a peak at z ~ 1.5.
Our results using eROSITA support this conclusion, as the soft
X-rays seen by eROSITA exhibit similar properties as the hard
X-ray sources studied by Langejahn et al. (2020), although the
evolution found by them is different than in other studies (e.g.,
Toda et al. 2017; Marcotulli et al. 2022).

The number of blazars eROSITA was supposed to detect has
been predicted in the literature assuming that soft and hard X-ray
log N-log S -distributions are similar. Toda et al. (2017) predicted
eROSITA to observe 13900 FSRQs and 1900 BLLs on the entire
sky within four years. We indeed detect slightly more FSRQs
than BLLs, at low fluxes more FSRQs are observed by roughly
an order of magnitude. The prediction would require the vast ma-
jority of unclassified sources to be FSRQs, which would be in-
consistent with the expectation that BCUs are more likely BLLs.
Considering that the actual eROSITA survey is less sensitive than
assumed, the numbers at least somewhat agree as a rough order-
of magnitude estimate.

Marcotulli et al. (2022) predicted that in its first
year eROSITA should observe 230023 FSRQs with fluxes
Fx,02-20kev = 1 x 107! ergcm=* s“! across the entire sky and
across a wide range of redshifts. The BlazEr1 catalog contains

Article number, page 18 of 39

not even 1% of this predicted number. Considering the best fit to
the log N-logS distribution for the FSRQ sample, ~2.17 deg
are expected to be observed, corresponding to 89654 FSROs
over the entire sky, which only corresponds to 39% of the pre-
dicted number. The discrepancy is in part caused by Marcotulli
et al. (2022) assuming a different, deeper, limiting flux level.
Additionally, the assumed slopes of the log N-log S distribution
are different and both estimates assume that the slope at higher
fluxes is the same at low fluxes, which might not be the case.

5.6. Past X-ray observations and properties of eROSITA
detected blazars

In this section, we compare our eROSITA results with those from
other missions, for sources which are detected in both. Since
earlier work estimated fluxes assuming power law slopes with
Tx = 1.7 or similar (OUSXB: Tx = 1.8), when comparing re-
sults in this subsection we will consistently use eROSITA-fluxes
obtained assuming [x = 1.7, even for those where we or the
other works were able to constrain the spectral shape.

ROSAT, as the precursor of eROSITA, sets the benchmark for
all-sky surveys at soft X-ray energies. Due to the different spa-
tial accuracies we matched the eROSITA detected sources with a
quite large radius < 40’, hence this comparison is more prone to
potential mismatches. In total we obtain 1496 matches between
eROSITA and ROSAT and in total 1865 ROSAT sources coincid-
ing with BLAZE catalog objects on the western Galactic hemi-
sphere within 40”. Of the ROSAT BLAZE catalog matches, 108
are included in the unverified BlazEr1 catalog, while 261 sources
detected by ROSAT are not detected by eROSITA. Therefore
eROSITA is able to recover 84% of the blazars and blazar can-
didates detected by ROSAT. Since eROSITA is sensitive over the
entire sky down to a similar flux limit as ROSAT (Fx, 0.1-2.4kev =
10-? ergcm~? s~!, Boller et al. 2016), the sources not included
in the BlazEr1 catalogs are probably missing due to variability.
The fluxes measured by ROSAT agree with the eROSITA fluxes
within the eROSITA uncertainties in only 9.5% of the matches.
Variability is present and the majority of sources are within the
same order of magnitude. There are 543 objects with ROSAT
fluxes higher by more than an order of magnitude, whereas for
the reverse, only five cases are observed. This subsample of high-
flux ROSAT matches does not grow or shrink in number with
different angular separations between the source positions of the
two missions. A similar trend with respect to XMM-Newton is
reported by Boller et al. (2016; their Fig. 25), probably caused
by spurious ROSAT detections combined with systematic dif-
ferences between the instruments, such as energy coverage and
sensitivity. The ROSAT photon indices are not well constrained,
have large uncertainties and do not correlate with the eROSITA
ones. This is likely due to the different signal-to-noise levels and
the restricted energy coverage of ROSAT.

For sources both in the eROSITA and the Swift-XRT cat-
alog (Evans et al. 2020), we confidently detect 1249 of the
1700 matches within the eRASS1 footprint between Evans et al.
(2020) and the BLAZE catalog , assuming a maximum separa-
tion of 8”. 451 sources are not part of the BlazEr1 catalog and

Hammerich et al.: BlazEr1: The eROSITA Blazar Catalog

eROSITA picks up 73% of the Swift-XRT detected blazars and
blazar candidates. The fluxes are broadly consistent, although
only 25% of the matches agree with each other within the un-
certainties. However, many sources tend to have higher fluxes in
Swift-XRT than in eROSITA: for 57% of the sources the flux in
eROSITA is at least 30% less than in Swift-XRT. This higher flux
is caused partly by variability, but also due to the fact that the ap-
proach of Evans et al. (2020) uses all available data for a given
source position, such that these flux values represent the com-
bination of different flux states of a source, with a bias towards
brighter states. Many Swift-XRT observations are triggered fol-
lowing flaring states, explaining a bias towards brighter states.
Sensitivity differences between the instruments might also play
a role. The photon indices mostly agree with each other, with a
slight trend towards somewhat softer photon indices measured
with eROSITA (AT’x ~ 0.05).

A similar picture presents itself when comparing our cata-
log to the OUSXB (Giommi et al. 2019). Similar to Evans et al.
(2020), this catalog uses all Swift-XRT observations, however,
the catalog offers data for each individual observation. In terms
of total numbers, OUSXB DR3 contains 1223 BLAZE catalog
sources in the western Galactic hemisphere (Giommi et al. 2019;
2508 BLAZE catalog sources are listed for the entire sky), of
which 1039 are confidently detected and an additional 85 ob-
jects are part of the unverified catalog. This means that only 99
sources go completely undetected by eROSITA.

The BlazEr1 catalog lists 2106 confirmed blazars, therefore
it is the largest collection of X-ray detected blazars on the west-
ern Galactic sky by a factor of 1.7. Taking the blazar candidates
into account, the BlazEr! catalog encompasses the largest sam-
ple of X-ray detected blazars and blazar-candidates to this day.
In Fig. 15 we compare the mean flux value of Giommi et al.
(2019) with our flux. Generally, the fluxes are consistent with
each other within the eROSITA uncertainties and the maximum
and minimum value provided by Giommi et al. (2019). In ~48%
of sources, we observe flux variations due to source variabil-
ity. However, due to a slightly different photon index being used
and due to the observational biases by Swift-XRT in terms of in-
cluding all data and therefore also including flares, for more than
50% of the sources the fluxes do not agree. The same has already
been observed when comparing to the catalog by Evans et al.
(2020). Generally, the photon indices are consistent with each
other with ~68% of the values agreeing within the uncertainties
of eROSITA and the maximum and minimum values given in
the OUSXB (Fig. 16). Overall, there seems to be a slight trend
of deriving softer photon indices using eROSITA compared to
Swift-XRT (mean AI'x ~ 0.08, with 17% of the sources having
a diverging photon index of at least 1a deviation). This may be
explained by the harder-when-brighter trend in connection with
the bias of Swift-XRT observations towards flaring states. Over-
all, the results derived from eROSITA data are consistent with
previous studies.

For the hard X-rays we compare our soft X-ray fluxes with
the hard X-ray fluxes obtained by Swift-BAT (Lien et al. 2025)
and NuSTAR (Middei et al. 2022). Very few sources are identi-
fied in the Swift-BAT data. The Swift-BAT fluxes are all in a sim-
ilar range and we test how these hard X-ray fluxes correlate with
the eROSITA flux. Swift-BAT picks up more FSRQs and BCUs,
and they tend to have slightly higher fluxes in Swift-BAT com-
pared to BLLs, for which all correlations are insignificant. For
the softer NuSTAR band higher fluxes in eROSITA correspond
to higher fluxes in NuSTAR. In the harder band, the trends are
quite similar but appear with weaker significance. The photon
indices of NuSTAR and Swift-BAT are similar to those observed

by eROSITA, establishing a linear correlation between indices in
the soft and hard X-ray band.

Finally, we stress that many of the BlazErl sources were
never observed with other X-ray missions. It contains 5569 and
5649 sources that have never been observed by XMM-Newton
and Chandra, respectively. Other missions show similar high
numbers of unobserved sources (ASCA: 5808, NuSTAR: 5761,
Suzaku: 5822, Swift-XRT: 3909 and ROSAT: 5623). We find that
3668 BlazErl sources (63% of the BlazEr1 catalog) have no
prior X-ray observations with any of the listed missions. Consid-
ering only confirmed blazars, 38% of these were never observed
with any pointed X-ray instrument. The sample of previously un-
observed blazars is dominated by FSRQs and BCUs. Since BLLs

are more easily detected due to their higher X-ray fluxes, they
might be targeted more often, such that previous missions will
have more exposure time at positions associated with BLLs. Due
to the large amount of new X-ray data, eROSITA enables us to
study a more complete picture of the blazar population.

5.7. Multiwavelength properties of the BlazEr1 sources

In this section, we combine eROSITA data with multiwavelength
data available for BlazEr1 sources (see Sect. 4). We discuss the
y-ray, radio, infrared, and optical properties and how the proper-
ties in the different wavelength regimes are connected with the
X-rays.

5.7.1. The y-ray emission of BlazEr1 sources

In Figure 17 we compare the X-ray and y-ray fluxes of
the BlazErl sources. We fit a linear function in log-space
(log;(Fy,0.2-100Gev) = m X 1ogj9(Fx,0.2-2.3kev) + 1) to the dis-
tributions, and calculate correlation coefficients. For FSRQs, a
dense cloud indicating a direct correlation of X-ray and y-ray
fluxes can be seen, although the correlation is weak. The distri-
butions of BLLs and BCUs are more spread out and most likely
not correlated. Since almost all FSRQs belong to the class of
LSPs, a correlation between X-ray and y-ray emission is some-
what expected as the emission is expected to be produced by
the same emission mechanism. For BLLs and BCUs, which con-
sist of a mix of LSPs, ISPs, and HSPs, a correlation is less
straightforward, but from Fx.0.2-23kev ~ 2 x 107! ergem™? s~!
on, sources with higher X-ray fluxes also seem to have higher
y-ray fluxes. Additionally, we observe that in general, sources
with a y-ray detection have higher X-ray fluxes than the non-y-
ray detected ones, which has also been previously reported by
Paliya et al. (2017).

In Fig. 18 we compare the Fermi-LAT photon indices to the
eROSITA photon indices. There is a clear separation between
BLLs and FSRQs. On average, the X-ray index of BLLs is softer
than the y-ray index, while for FSRQs the opposite is observed.
This is partly due to the different SED types these classes are
mainly associated with. However, roughly 4% of the BLLs are
occupying the same region as the FSRQs, which are mostly clas-
sified as LSPs. The BCUs are distributed among the different
groups. Previous studies (e.g., Comastri et al. 1997; Fan et al.
2012; Yuan & Fan 2014) have found that the X-ray and y-ray
photon indices of the entire blazar population are anti-correlated.
This trend is seen for the overall sample as well (see Fig. 18),
however, not as strongly and there also seem to be differences
for the subgroups. For the entire sample we find a best fit with a
linear fit function (IT, = m x I'x + 1) with fit values between the
ones reported by Fan et al. (2012) and Yuan & Fan (2014). We
emphasize that the correlation is relatively weak but significant.
The subgroups show no correlation, with the exception of a very
weak anticorrelation for BCUs.

We note that the data compared here have not been taken si-
multaneously, and we compare X-ray fluxes taken at a specific
time (during eRASS1) with y-ray fluxes from the 4FGL-DR4
averaged over 14 years. Hence, variability can make the inter-
pretation difficult.

5.7.2. Radio emission of BlazEr1 sources

In Fig. 19 we show the flux densities obtained from TANAMI,
MOJAVE, and RFC as a function of eROSITA flux. Of the 52

Fig. 17. Fermi-LAT fluxes (4FGL-DR4; Abdollahi et al. 2022) com-
pared with eROSITA fluxes. The three panels show the different sub-
types, following the color scheme introduced in Fig. 3 (a: FSRQs, b:
BLLs, c: BCUs). The Fermi-LAT uncertainties are scaled to match the
confidence limit of the eROSITA data.

TANAMI matches, the majority belongs to the FSRQ class, as this
program targets y-ray detected sources up to a limiting radio flux
density, as well as highly variable jetted non-blazar AGN. Flux
densities in TANAMI mostly increase as a function of eROSITA
flux and we find a strong correlation for FSRQs. Almost twice as
many objects are matched with MOJAVE (97); the overall trends
are similar to TANAMI and a correlation with the eROSITA flux
is found as well. The RFC contains radio flux densities for 2620
BlazEr1 sources. Again a similar trend of the flux densities be-
ing correlated as in TANAMI and MOJAVE is observed for FSRQs.
Based on the RFC data, we find that for BLLs flux densities in the
radio are similar, regardless of the X-ray flux and no strong cor-
relation is found. This behavior is also observed for the BLLs in
TANAMI and MOJAVE, although the number of individual objects
is very low compared to the RFC and the correlations found are

not statistically significant. Again, the different physical origin
of the emission is likely driving the diverging behavior between
the FSRQs and BLLs.

5.7.3. Infrared and optical properties of eROSITA detected
blazars

Infrared colors are commonly used to characterize different
types of AGN (e.g., Salvato et al. 2018; their Fig. 9). In the in-
frared color-color diagram (Fig. 20) blazars occupy a distinct
region due to the non-thermal emission of the jet, which enables
good distinction from thermal emitters (Massaro et al. 2011;
D’ Abrusco et al. 2012; Massaro et al. 2012; Salvato et al. 2018;
de Menezes et al. 2019). Most of the sources in BlazEr1 are con-
tained within the WISE blazar strip, consistent with non-thermal
emission and an extragalactic origin. This strip also covers the
region usually occupied by QSOs and Seyfert galaxies, and ex-
tends towards spiral and elliptical galaxies. Objects located far
from this region are mostly blazar candidates of some kind, al-
though sources associated with confirmed blazars are found in
other parts of the color-color diagram as well. A high number of
BCUCs are found in the regions associated with starburst, spiral,
and elliptical galaxies, as well as stars. The infrared colors also
separate the BLLs and FSRQs as they are found in different re-
gions. BLLs tend to have bluer colors than the FSRQs. BCUs are
found in similar loci as BLLs and FSRQs.

We can also combine the infrared data with optical and X-
ray information. In Fig. 21 we show four different photometric
spaces, which can be used to distinguish between Galactic and
extragalactic sources and see if objects exhibit similar properties
as other AGN (Salvato et al. 2022). The (g—r)-(z—W1) color-
color diagram is shown in Fig. 21a. Most BlazEr1 sources are
above the dotted line and thus consistent with being extragalac-
tic. There are many candidates, as well as a small number of
confirmed sources below this line, hinting at a low level of con-
tamination (see Sect. 3.2).

ing the color scheme introduced in Fig. 3, using a data from the TANAMI
program, b data from MOJAVE, and ¢ X-band flux densities from the RFC
catalog.

A sequence parallel to the separation line can be identified as
well, mainly consisting of candidates, BCUs, and BZGs, which is
typically the location of quiescent galaxies. Salvato et al. (2022)
show a similar trend with redshift, where sources at low red-
shifts are more red. This trend is also observed in our sample,
since FSRQs are typically found at higher redshifts and are also
located at bluer colors. In Fig. 21b we show the W1 magnitude as
a function of X-ray flux. This information can be used to check
the extragalactic content, although the separation line shown be-
comes a less robust indicator as the X-ray survey increases in
size (Salvato et al. 2022). While most sources are consistent with
an extragalactic origin, the objects below this line are BCUCs,
again indicating that the catalog is subject to some degree of con-
tamination. The optical-infrared color-color diagram (Fig. 21c),
which can be used to distinguish stars from AGN, does not ex-

hibit a sequence of most likely Galactic sources as seen in Sal-
vato et al. (2022), maybe due to the incompleteness of Gaia. The
tail at high values of g-W1 corresponding to inactive galaxies
is less pronounced and mainly occupied by candidates (BCUCs
and BLLCs). The WISE color-magnitude diagram (Fig. 21d) can
be used to identify stars (typically W1—W2 ~ 0.0, marked with
a dashed line) and quasars. Most objects are quasar-like.

The BlazEr1 sources are located where we expect to observe
AGNs and only very few are located elsewhere and are inconsis-
tent with an extragalactic nature. Overall, sources are similar to
QSOs (solid gray line) and extend towards the loci of Seyferts
(dotted gray line), where we also find a high number of candi-
dates. The infrared and optical data show that the catalog might
have some degree of contamination by other source types, al-
though a detailed source-by-source analysis would be required
to see if sources with data typical for non-blazars are in fact con-
taminants.

5.7.4. Broadband spectral indices of the eROSITA blazars

As detailed in Sect. 4.5, in order to relate the X-rays to other
bands we computed broadband spectral indices, aj, for different
bands from the radio to the y rays. For a given SED, the observed
spectral index will depend on the peak frequencies and the lumi-
nosities of the SED peaks. A value a > 1.0 indicates a negative
slope in vF, space, meaning the SED decreases towards higher
energies. We display the broadband spectral indices as calculated
from various bands against each other in Fig. 22. For objects
that are also in the 4LAC, in Fig. A.4, we show the indices as
a function of Compton dominance, the ratio of the peak fluxes,
and low- and high-energy SED peak frequencies (Ajello et al.
2020, 2022). Additionally, we calculate correlation coefficients
for different parameter combinations in order to assess the cor-
relations between parameters for the entire sample and the BLL

and FSRQ sub samples. The results are listed in Tables B.2 and
B.3 and mean values obtained for the broadband spectral indices
are shown in Table B.4.

FSRQs mostly show values of axr ~ 1.0, that is they show
no significant increase or decrease from the X-rays towards the y
rays, which is expected, since X-rays are more likely to cover the
rise of the high-energy peak and the y rays cover the fall of the
same peak. The values of axr do not correlate significantly with
the peak positions but there is a significant weak anticorrelation
with Compton dominance (see Fig. A.4i and Table B.2). As in-
dicated by the values of a@ox, a decreasing slope from the optical
towards the X-rays is observed for a majority of FSRQs, and
no correlation with the SED parameters is found. Similar results
are found for ayrx, however, the slopes are slightly steeper and
the dispersion is smaller (see Table B.4), perhaps due to FSRQs
displaying a big blue bump which adds flux in the infrared-UV
range (Krau8 et al. 2016). A very weak correlation between the
infrared X-ray spectral index ajax and the low-energy peak po-
sition is present. Only extreme cases of FSRQs with low-energy
peaks in the radio range are found to decrease from the radio to-
wards the X-rays, however, the vast majority of sources show an
increase. We find a very weak anticorrelation between apx and
the low-energy peak position.

For BLLs both rising and falling indices from the X-rays to
the y rays are observed, but the mean value indicates a flat in-
dex. Sources with decreasing slopes have their high-energy peak
at energies below GeV y rays, where Fermi-LAT is sensitive, and
show low Compton dominance. Larger values of axr are linked
to higher peak frequencies, as this parameter is moderately and
weakly correlated with the low- and high-energy peak frequen-
cies, respectively, and a lower Compton dominance, with a weak
anticorrelation being present. The values of a@ox indicate that for
BLLs, on average a decreasing slope from the optical towards the
X-rays is observed. However, some sources exhibit an increase
that corresponds to extreme HSPs. In general, a higher spread of
values is seen than for FSRQs. In most cases the low-energy peak
occurs at energies lower than the X-ray band and an increase in
the value of @ox corresponds to a lower peak frequency for the
low-energy peak, but this anticorrelation is very weak. An anti-
correlation with the peak frequency of the high-energy peak is
observed, however, we find no correlation with Compton domi-
nance.

We observe a very similar picture for the infrared range.
BLLs are found at more extreme decreasing and increasing
slopes towards the X-ray band than the FSRQs as indicated by
the larger spread. We observe only a weak anticorrelation with
the position of the low-energy peak and a moderate one with the
high-energy peak. BLLs show a stronger increase from the radio
band towards the X-rays than FSRQs and a higher dispersion.
We see a moderate anticorrelation with the SED peak positions.
Since in many BLLs the radio and X-ray emission are thought to
originate from the same process, a trend between peak positions
and a-values is expected, as lower values in @ correspond to peak
positions at higher energies. Candidates and confirmed blazars
show similar behavior without significant offsets. The BCUs are
consistent with being blazars of either type.

For axr we find a significantly strong or moderate anticor-
relation with all other indices, however, the correlation is dif-
ferent for FSRQs and BLLs, as for the BLLs the anticorrelations
are stronger. There is a weaker anticorrelation between axr for
FSRQs and the other ranges, consistent with the X-rays cover-
ing the dip of the low-energy peak or the rise of the high-energy
peak in the SED. For BLLs the anticorrelation is stronger, and for
lower axr values, these BLLs have higher Compton dominance

and lower peak frequencies (LSP). The @ox and ayrx indices
have higher values compared to axr, which is the opposite of
@rx. For the BLLs a strong correlation is found with the arx
and the infrared and optical. For the FSRQs we find no or only
very weak correlations. This is expected, as in many BLLs these
bands share the same emission process origin, showing strong
correlations, whereas for FSRQs the X-rays originate from the
high-energy peak but the other bands are related to the low-
energy peak. The correlation between @ox and ayrx is a strong
or moderate one, with a@ox having slightly higher values. The

weaker correlation for FSRQs is probably due to the big blue
bump (Krau8 et al. 2016; and references therein).

The values derived for @ox are similar to those found in
the literature (see, e.g., Giommi et al. 1999; Turriziani et al.
2007). Broadband spectral indices for the y rays and X-rays have
also been provided for example by Comastri et al. (1997) using
EGRET, however, their values (FSRQs: axr = 0.58+0.12, BLLs:
axr = 0.83+0.18) are lower than ours, probably due to the lower
energy band covered in the y rays.

No significant strong or moderate correlations can be found
between the photon indices and values of a, however, the sub-

classes show different trends. We found only weak correlations
for BLLs with ajax and a@ox and a weak anticorrelation with
axr. Anticorrelations from some samples with apx are observed.
Moderate correlations between the @-value and redshift are ob-
served. The exp, decreases with redshift, while agx increases.

Since values of a correlate with the SED peaks and Compton
dominance, selection cuts could be applied to identify sources
with different SED types or certain peak positions. In particu-
lar, @irx, @ox, and a@px could be useful to classify the sources
into HSP (apgx < 0.69, ajrx < 1.12) and LSP (a@px > 0.87,
1.5 > atrx > 1.0) categories. For ISP it is not possible to find
boundaries that separate them from the other SED types well.
For the HSP constraints, 69% of classifications agree with the
SED definition when compared to the 4LAC catalog; for LSPs
more than 96% are recovered. The BlazEr1 catalog contains 127
blazars within the HSP constraints outlined, these could poten-
tially be TeV blazars (see Metzger et al. 2025), and 812 sources
within the proposed LSP criteria. Sources with values close to
Qrx ~ 1.2, @ox ~ 1.2, and agx ~ 1.0 could be MeV blazars,
and are interesting targets for future MeV missions (e.g., COSI;
Tomsick et al. 2019, 2024).

5.8. Why are some sources not detected?

We now consider objects which have not been detected by
eROSITA, or only at low significance. In Table 6 we list the
number of detected sources from each input catalog, also distin-
guishing among the different classes, with respect to the west-
ern Galactic hemisphere, and considering the quality cuts to
the BLAZE catalog. Overall, only ~14% of all BLAZE cata-
log sources are part of the BlazEr1 catalog, however, ~69% of
the gold sample (confirmed blazars in the BLAZE catalog) is
detected. Due to eROSITA’s all-sky survey strategy and higher
sensitivity we miss less than one third of the confirm blazar pop-

ulation, a significant improvement to Swift-XRT (43%, Giommi
et al. 2019).

The BZCAT, 4FGL, and 3HSP catalogs exhibit the highest
detection fraction among all input catalogs, as they contain the
most extensive list of confirmed blazars. The fact that the 4FGL
has such a high detection rate implies that y rays are a good
indicator for a subsequent X-ray detection, which is connected
to the fact that the y-ray detected sources have brighter X-ray
fluxes. The HighZ objects are less likely to be detected, probably
due to their faintness given their high redshifts. The candidates
also have a lower detection rate, which is due to contamination
and these sources generally being fainter. The Milliquas cata-
log, which mainly adds candidates to the BLAZE catalog, has
a high-detection rate as well, due to also containing many con-
firmed blazars. Other candidate catalogs exhibit detection rates
between 8% and 58%. The BROS catalog has the lowest detec-
tion rate, despite having the highest number of input sources. A
large contributing factor is the increased level of contamination
compared to other catalogs.

Among the confirmed blazars, BLLs and FSRQs have
slightly higher detection rates than BCUs, of which only more
than half are detected. This could mean that BCUs also contain
more contaminating objects, and that their X-ray fluxes are too
low to be detected. The different candidate classes have lower
detection rates. eROSITA is more likely to detect FSRQCs than
other candidate classes.

As a next step we use the eROSITA sensitivity (see Sect. 3.3)
to obtain flux and luminosity upper limits for the undetected
blazars and blazar candidates. The majority of non-detected
sources have upper limits below the flux at which the all-sky
survey is complete (Fig. 4). The upper limits agree with those
of Tubin-Arenas et al. (2024). Since Tubin-Arenas et al. (2024)
also considered the counts actually observed by eROSITA, their
upper limits are sometimes higher than ours. As a next step,
we calculate luminosity upper limits for sources with known
redshifts (Fig. 23). The exposure times, fluxes and luminosity
limits are all listed in the BLAZE catalog. At low redshifts,
BCUs in particular are abundant. We also observe FSRQs at
higher redshifts than BLLs as previously seen in Sect. 5.2. The

whereas sources without a significant detection are shown in color. Ar-
rows display upper limits.

Fx,02-23kev = 1 x 107'*ergcm~? s“!, indicates that the lower

luminosity population is missed due to the sensitivity limit of
eROSITA.

Similar to Fig. 17, we compare the X-ray upper limits to y-
ray fluxes in Fig. 24. The majority of non-detections correspond
to BCUs, found at lower y-ray fluxes than detected sources.
Of the undetected blazars with a counterpart in the 4LAC cat-
alog, the majority are LSPs (265 objects), ISPs and HSPs are
less prominent (76 and 29, respectively). LSPs are expected to
exhibit harder spectra, which hints at a potential bias towards
softer and more high peaked objects, which are easier to detect.
It is likely that all these sources were missed in eRASS1 due to
being faint.

These results tell us that subsequent all-sky survey releases
by eROSITA will have higher detection rates than the BlazEr1
catalog, as the faintness of the sources represents one of the main
limitations for our catalog.

pendix D). To date, this catalog is the most complete compila-
tion of confirmed X-ray detected blazars on the western Galactic
hemisphere, and to our knowledge the largest catalog of X-ray
detected blazars and blazar candidates. Overall, the BlazEr1 cat-
alog is expected to contain at most 633 contaminating sources
(Sect. 3.2).

The main scientific results obtained from an analysis of the
catalog include the distribution of photon indices for the spec-
troscopic sample (Sect. 5.4), which clearly show that the differ-
ent blazar sub-types exhibit distinct spectral properties, allowing
tentative statements on the subtype based on the photon index.
The relations between the spectral properties and fluxes and lu-
minosities are consistent with expectations from the blazar se-
quence (Sect. 5.4). We find that eROSITA is more sensitive to-
wards low-flux FSRQs than low-flux BLLs, probably due to very
soft spectra displayed by the latter. Most of the brightest blazars
detected are BLLs, while the fluxes of y-ray detected sources are
higher than those of the non y-ray detected ones.

The slopes of the log N-log S distributions constructed from
the catalog imply a negative cosmological evolution, both for the
entire sample and for different sub-samples, meaning the objects
are more common in the local Universe, although for the blazar
candidates the value could indicate a slight positive evolution
(Sect. 5.5). The observed distributions agree well with theoret-

ical predictions (Giommi & Padovani 2015). We find evidence
for a population inversion between BLLs and FSRQs at lower
fluxes.

The spectral properties, fluxes, and luminosities of the BCUs
are similar to low flux BLLs, consistent with other publications
(Sect. 5.2; Kang et al. 2019; Pefia-Herazo et al. 2020; Chiaro
et al. 2021). The multiwavelength data help to separate blazars
into their respective classes using color-color diagrams and high-
lights the importance of the eROSITA data for building a com-
prehensive blazar catalog, study their properties, as well as for
future SED modeling (Sect. 5.7).

The BlazEr1 catalog can serve as a benchmark for over-
all blazar properties and single-object properties since it pro-
vides the first X-ray observation for many blazars. For instance,
the eROSITA data will be crucial to constrain the SEDs of a
large number of objects, including samples such as those from
TANAMI, MOJAVE, or 4FGL. Earlier applications of the eRASS1
catalog included the identification of X-ray counterparts for an
ultra-high-energy neutrino event (Adriani et al. 2025) and the
identification of TeV blazar candidates for follow-up observa-
tions (Metzger et al. 2025; see also Marchesi et al. 2025).

Additionally, the eROSITA surveys allow for a detailed vari-
ability study on time scales of hours-days for the brightest and,
on a half-year time line for all other sources. The BlazEr1 cata-
log provides the framework for these studies. Examples include
work on X-ray blazar flares, as demonstrated, for instance, for
PKS 0735+178 (Haémmerich et al. 2021b; Sahakyan et al. 2022)
or a y-ray flare of TXS 0646-176 (Hammerich et al. 202 1a).

A subsequent data release of 2.2 years of data (eRASS:5),
will allows us to provide an updated, deeper version of the cat-
alog. The cumulative eROSITA data will also deepen the cata-
log, making the eRASS:5 version of the catalog, which will con-
tain 2.2 years of data, the deepest X-ray blazar catalog ever con-
structed.

Appendix A: Supplemental figures

In this Appendix we extend the discussion of the main part of this paper with further diagnostic information. Figures A.1 and A.2

display the distributions of the normalized angular separation with respect to $25. In Fig. A.3 the fits to the log N-log S distributions
are shown and Fig. A.4 summarizes the relation between SED parameters and broadband spectral indices.

Hammerich et al.: BlazErl: The eROSITA Blazar Catalog

Appendix C: The BLAZE catalogs

The BLAZE catalog is obtained by merging the catalogs listed in
Table | with the respective merging radii (Sect. 2). The BLAZE
catalog contains redshifts from these input catalogs. Based on
eROSITA’s sensitivity and exposure, we are able to calculate flux
and luminosity upper limits for all sources in the western Galac-
tic hemisphere. The sources removed due to quality issues (see
Sect. 2.2) are released as a separate file as well. The catalogs are
released as FITS files with the following columns:

SRC_NAME: Common name of the source.

RAJ2000, DEJ2000: Equatorial coordinates from input catalog
[°, 2000.0].

LIL, BU: Galactic coordinates from input catalog [°].

BLAZAR_CLASS: Classification given by the input catalog.

Z: Redshift given in the input catalog.

Z_REF: Reference for the redshift.

ERO_EXPO: eROSITA exposure time at source position, if
available [s].

ERO_UL_FLUX: Upper limit 0.2-2.3 keV flux, based on expo-
sure time and sensitivity [erg cm~? s~'].

ERO_UL_LUM: Upper limit for the 0.2-2.3keV luminosity
band based on ERO_UL_FLUX [erg em~? s~!].

REMOVE_FLAG: Only for the unverified BLAZE catalog, rea-
son for removal: 1: HECATE, 2: Xie et al. (2024), 3: Rakshit
et al. (2017), 4: Gordon et al. (2023), 5: known non-blazar.

Appendix D: The BlazEr1 catalogs

In the following we describe all 661 FITS columns of the
BlazEr1 catalogs, that is, the unverified and the standard BlazEr1
catalog. As described in Sect. 3.1.1, these catalogs were obtained
by merging various input catalogs, which are matched with the
eRASS1 catalog (Merloni et al. 2024), and amending this list of
sources with additional information such as, for example, spec-
tral fit results. In the following the energy bands for X-ray and
y-ray fluxes and luminosities are denoted with n, where n is de-
fined in Table D.1. For the fluxes determined by fitting a power
law with fixed photon index to the spectra we denote the pho-
ton index G used, as listed in Table D.2. The LS10 bands (G,
R, L, Z, W1, W2, W3, and W4) are denoted by X in the column
names listed below. For RFC values the bands (s, c, x, u, and k)
are denoted by Y. Not all parameters will have all of the bands
available denoted with X. Where parameters have uncertainties,
they are consistently listed in a column obtained by appending
_ERR to the column name. For symmetric error bars the column
is a standard FITS column, asymmetric confidence intervals of
the type P*! are given as fixed length arrays with two entries,
—l and +u, including the sign. Sometimes symmetric and asym-
metric uncertainties are given, since some methods return asym-
metric uncertainties which then are approximately summarized
as symmetric ones (ERR, -ASYM_ERR). In the online Vizier
version the asymmetric uncertainty columns are prefixed by E_
and e_ for upper and lower uncertainties, respectively. Unless
noted otherwise, confidence intervals are given at the 1a confi-
dence level, except for spectral parameters (e.g., photon indices,
fluxes), where 90% confidence intervals are given, following the
conventions of X-ray astronomy. Sometimes the inverse variance
(_IVAR) is given instead of an uncertainty. Where columns are
taken from other catalogs, we sometimes copy in part the origi-
nal column descriptions in verbatim.
