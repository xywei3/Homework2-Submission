Abstract—The stereotypical reaching motion of the octopus
arm has drawn growing attention for its efficient control of
a highly deformable body. Previous studies suggest that its
characteristic bend propagation may share underlying prin-
ciples with the dynamics of a whip. This work investigates
whether whip-like passive dynamics in water can reproduce
the kinematic features observed in biological reaching and
their similarities and differences. Platform-based whipping tests
were performed in water and air while systematically varying
material stiffness and driving speed. Image-based quantification
revealed that the Ecoflex Gel 2 arm driven at 150 rpm
(motor speed) reproduced curvature propagation similar to that
observed in octopus reaching. However, its bend-point velocity
decreased monotonically rather than exhibiting the biological
bell-shaped profile, confirming that the octopus reaching move-
ment is not merely a passive whipping behavior. The absence
of propagation in air further highlights the critical role of the
surrounding medium in forming octopus-like reaching motion.
This study provides a new perspective for understand biological
reaching movement, and offers a potential platform for future
hydrodynamic research.

I. INTRODUCTION

The reaching movement of the octopus arm exemplifies
one of the most stereotyped and simplified control strategies
in its highly deformable muscular system. Unlike the human
arm with a limited number of joints, the octopus arm
possesses virtually infinite degrees of freedom, functioning
as a muscular hydrostat capable of bending, elongating,
shortening, and twisting without skeletal support. Despite
this structural complexity, octopuses can extend their arms
toward a target through highly similar reaching movements,
following a consistent bend-propagation pattern that is orga-
nized both spatially and temporally [1]-[3].

Previous studies have suggested that this movement shares
intriguing parallels with whipping-like passive dynamics [1],
[2], [5], [6]. Biological reaching can be described as a
base-to-tip propagating bend wave—arising from continuous
neural drive together with intrinsic elasticity and hydrody-
namic interaction—in which a traveling front of stiffening

mission [7], [8] reminiscent of a whip crack, as shown
in Figure. la [4]. The analogy suggests that the octopus
may utilize passive mechanical whipping to achieve rapid,
efficient reaching movement, converting local activation into

a large-scale sweeping-like reaching motion.

The detailed kinematics of the octopus reaching behavior
reveal several invariant features across individuals and con-
texts. The motion is initiated by the formation of a localized
bend near the arm base, which then propagates distally
along a nearly planar trajectory, maintaining a constant-
curvature bend propagation region over a significant portion
of the movement, as shown in Figure. 1b [1], [3], [7].
The bend-point velocity shows a characteristic bell-shaped
temporal profile with smooth acceleration and deceleration,
implying that control is exerted chiefly over the bend’s
spatiotemporal position rather than over discrete muscle seg-
ments [1]. Biomechanical and computational models further
demonstrate that a simple traveling wave of muscle stiffening
can reproduce the experimentally observed velocity profiles
and curvature evolutions [3], [7], supporting the notion
that the system relies on local passive wave mechanics
to generate globally coordinated motion. Collectively, these
findings portray octopus reaching as a dynamic balance
between active control and passive mechanical propagation,
embodying principles that resonate strongly with whipping
dynamics—where a localized deformation evolves into a
smooth, accelerating wave culminating in effective, directed
motion.

The whipping motion represents a canonical example
of energy focusing and curvature propagation in flexible
continua. When an impulse is applied to the handle of a whip,
a traveling loop or curvature wave propagates toward the free
end, gradually accelerating as the whip’s radius tapers and
mass per unit length decreases [9]. This process converts dis-
tributed elastic and kinetic energy into a concentrated, high-
velocity motion at the tip—eventually reaching supersonic
speed and producing the characteristic crack. Theoretical
analyses based on elastic rod models reveal that the travel-
ing wave maintains a quasi-constant curvature while local
velocity increases, consistent with conservation of energy
and momentum in a homogeneous medium. Importantly,
this bend propagation mechanism is not unique to whips;
similar dynamic principles have been identified in biological
systems such as fly-fishing lines, flagella, and even octopus
arms, where a local curvature travels through the body to
produce directed motion. From this perspective, the octopus
reaching behavior may be hypothesis as a biological man-
ifestation of the whipping phenomenon [4]. Both systems
rely on the propagation of a localized bend—maintaining
nearly constant curvature and exhibiting a bell-shaped ve-
locity evolution. In whips, the traveling loop is a fully
passive mechanical wave driven by the initial impulse and
geometric tapering; in octopus arms, a similar propagation
arises from the coupling of muscle activation waves and
passive environmental interactions. These parallels suggest
that understanding whipping dynamics provides not only a
physical analogue but also an experimental framework for
interpreting the passive wave-based control strategy observed
in octopus reaching motions.

Building upon these findings, we aimed to examine
whether the whipping dynamics in a fluid environment could

reproduce the bend-propagation characteristics observed in
octopus reaching, and whether such motions would ex-
hibit kinematic features comparable to biological reaching
movements. In particular, this study explores whether a
whip-like passive motion, when performed underwater, can
generate bend propagation, curvature evolution, and bend-
point velocity profiles similar to those recorded in octopus
reaching movements.

We first performed hand-driven trials in water to mimic
octopus reaching movements and then used the captured
trajectories to reverse design a repeatable rig: a PLA+ 3D-
printed frame carrying a tapered silicone arm that can repro-
duce the motions under controlled settings. Using this device,
we executed repeated runs while systematically switching
silicone grades and adjusting the rotation rate to examine
how these factors shape the outcome.

The videos were processed with a dedicated pipeline:
frames were uniformly sampled, the midline was recon-
structed for each frame, and from this we derived curvature
evolution and bend-point speed, which were compared with
published biological data. An Ecoflex Gel 2 (abbreviated as
Gel 2) arm operated at 150 rpm (motor speed) produced the
closest match in curvature propagation to octopus reaching;
however, the bend-point speed declined steadily rather than
forming the bell-shaped time course typical of animals.
Under identical actuation in air, no propagation was ob-
served, underscoring the dominance of the fluid environment.
Collectively, these results verify that the biological reaching
movement is not merely an arm-whipping motion from a
robotics perspective, highlight the importance of environment
medium in shaping the reaching behavior, and provide a
simple yet insightful experimental framework that may serve
as a tool for future hydrodynamics research on reaching
movements.

II. METHOD
A. Design of Mechanism

We first conducted manual whipping experiments in an un-
derwater environment to qualitatively reproduce the reaching
motion observed in octopus arms, as shown in Figure. 2. As
the extracted midline of real octopus reaching movement and
manual whipping motion shown in Figure. 3a and Figure. 3b,
the resulting motion sequence exhibited a distinct bend prop-
agation pattern similar to the biological reaching behavior.
Subsequently, a motion tracking software (Tracker) was used
to extract the positional coordinates and orientation angles of
the silicone arm’s base movement, as presented in Figure. 3c.
The recorded data were plotted on an x-y coordinate system
and imported into MotionGen, where a virtual mechanism
capable of outputting an analogous trajectory was generated,
as shown in Figure. 3d. Based on the generated trajectory,
the detailed structure of the linkage mechanism was designed
in SolidWorks, including each connecting link, joint, and
gear configuration (see Figure. 3e). To overcome the inherent
limitation of the motor’s output torque, an additional set of
power-amplifying gears was incorporated to enhance energy
transmission efficiency. Due to the constraints of manual

manipulation within the water tank, the observed motion pri-
marily exhibited a diagonally downward wave propagation.
To better approximate the actual reaching kinematics of the
octopus—where the curvature wave propagates nearly along
a horizontal plane—we elevated a section of the mechanism’s
supporting frame by approximately 20 degrees clockwise.
This adjustment redirected the path of motion transmission
in a nearly horizontal direction, allowing a more biologically
consistent wave propagation pattern.

Finally, all parts were fabricated using 3D printing with
PLA+ material and subsequently assembled into a complete
prototype mechanism with a tapered silicone arm, as shown
in Figure. 3f and the motor used in the mechanism has a
KV value of 350 rpm/V, a maximum current of 15 A, and a
maximum power of 300 W. The resulting system provided

a compact platform that allows fine-tuning of geometric
and actuation parameters for future experiments on wave
dynamics and underwater performance.

B. Data Extraction

Midline Extraction. To quantitatively analyze the de-
formation of the silicone octopus arm, we developed a
custom image-processing pipeline. As shown in Figure. 4a,
each video frame was first processed with Meta’s Segment
Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) [10] to segment the moving arm
from the underwater background. A binary mask was then
applied to remove the rigid supporting structure, yielding
a clean extraction of the silicone arm (Figure. 4b). The
extracted region was skeletonized to obtain its medial axis
(Figure. 4c). Because skeletonization can occasionally intro-
duce spurious branches, all branch points were detected and
removed. The three terminal nodes of the remaining skeleton
were subsequently identified, and the two closest endpoints
(£2, £3) were used to compute their midpoint M, which
served as an auxiliary node to reconstruct the main, ordered
centerline (Figure. 4d).

Curvature Computation. The reconstructed midline was
smoothed and uniformly resampled to generate evenly spaced
reference points along the arm. For each sampled point,

the local curvature k was computed using a three-point
geometric method: for a point P; and its two adjacent
neighbors P;_; and P;+1, a circle passing through these three
points was fitted, and the curvature was defined as

1
=
where R is the radius of the fitted circle. This approach yields
a continuous curvature profile along the arm, effectively
describing the spatial propagation of bending.

Bend-point Velocity Identification. The bending point
was defined as the midline location with the minimum x-
coordinate in each frame. Using the known time interval be-
tween consecutive frames, the displacement of this bending
point was tracked to compute its velocity. This procedure
provides a quantitative measure of the propagation speed of
the curvature wave along the soft robotic arm during the
reaching motion.

Ill. RESULTS

During the initial manual whipping tests, the Gel 2 arm
demonstrated the most distinct and similar bending response
among all tested materials. Based on this observation, we
selected Gel 2 as the reference material for subsequent
variable-speed experiments, aiming to determine an appro-
priate driving velocity capable of generating clear bend
propagation. After identifying this optimal condition, the
same fixed-speed tests were conducted for the other two
materials (Ecoflex 10 and Dragonskin 10) for comparison.

In the variable-speed tests, three driving motor velocities
were evaluated: 30 rpm, 90 rpm, and 150 rpm. Motions

exceeding 210 rpm were excluded because the arm exhibited
out-of-plane deviations that disrupted the planar curvature
propagation. For each condition, the recorded trajectories
were processed to visualize the bend point velocity as a
function of normalized time and velocity and the temporal
evolution of curvature along the normalized arm length, as
shown in Figure. 6b and Figure. 7.

For different driving speeds of the Gel 2 arm (Fig-
ure. 7a—7c), the curvature pattern at 150 rpm was most
consistent with biological reaching (see Figure. 5), showing
a temporal evolution similar to that observed in octopus
arm motion (Figure. 1b). The curvature first decreased,
then increased, and finally decayed, resulting in the largest
amplitude and most distinct propagation among the samples
tested. In contrast, Ecoflex 10 and Dragonskin 10 produced
smaller curvature magnitudes and less continuous propaga-
tion (Figure. 7c—7e).

In both the variable-speed experiments (Gel 2 at 30, 60,
and 150 rpm) and the variable-material experiments (Gel
2, Ecoflex 10, and Dragonskin 10 at a fixed speed of 150
rpm), the propagation velocity of the bend point along the
x-direction exhibited a monotonically decreasing trend over
time (Figure. 6b). In all cases, the bend point started with a
relatively high velocity, which rapidly decayed and gradually
approached zero.

IV. DISCUSSION

Material and speed strongly modulate the bend propaga-
tion. Among the tested conditions, Gel 2 generated the largest
curvature amplitudes and the most continuous transmission;
Ecoflex 10 showed intermediate behavior, while Dragonskin

10 attenuated fastest. Driving at 150 rpm provided an optimal
balance between input energy and hydrodynamic loading,
producing the most similar propagation to biological reach-
ing. By contrast, lower speeds yielded insufficient momen-
tum to sustain wave transmission, whereas excessive driving
speeds introduced inertial and hydrodynamic instabilities that
disrupted the planar mode of propagation.

Despite the clear spatial resemblance between the curva-
ture evolution of Gel 2 at 150 rpm and biological reaching,
the bend-point velocity shows a monotonically decreasing
time course in both the variable-speed and variable-material
experiments (see Figure. 6b) instead of the bell-shaped
profile typical of biological reaching as shown in Figure. 6a.
This finding supports the interpretation that the observed
motion represents a passive hydrodynamic propagation rather
than an actively controlled reaching behavior. Mechanisti-
cally, the monotonic decay accords with dissipative propa-
gation of a passive wave, where viscous drag from the fluid
continuously drain energy: the initial actuation originates at
the base and attenuates as it travels, leading to a reduction
of kinetic energy and curvature amplitude.

Interestingly, the curvature patterns of Gel 2 at low driving
speed (30 rpm) exhibited temporal profiles similar to those
of Ecoflex 10 and Dragonskin 10 driven at 150 rpm. This
correspondence suggests that curvature propagation depends
not only on material modulus but also on the relative balance
between actuation intensity and inertial loading. The softer
Gel 2 at low driving speed and the stiffer Ecoflex 10 and
Dragonskin 10 at moderate speed appear to reach comparable
dynamic regimes where elastic recovery dominates over
inertia-driven momentum transfer. Under these conditions,
the bending wave travels through passive redistribution of
kinetic and elastic energy along the arm, leading to similar
curvature attenuation profiles across materials. This behavior
aligns with the whip-wave dynamics described by McMillen
and Goriely [9], where energy imparted at the base propa-
gates through a continuous medium via inertial coupling and
geometric nonlinearity.

Furthermore, at higher speeds (210 rpm), the silicone arm
occasionally exhibited non-planar motion characterized by
twisting and asymmetric trajectories. We hypothesize that
this phenomenon arises from strong fluid—structure coupling,
where the interaction between the rapidly deforming arm
and the surrounding flow generates three-dimensional hy-
drodynamic instabilities. Similar out-of-plane deformations
have been reported in previous fluid-structure interaction
studies of flexible bodies in oscillatory or traveling-wave
motion [11], [12]. In these works, the coupling between
structural elasticity, inertial loading, and unsteady vortex
shedding can drive spontaneous transitions from planar to
helical or chaotic motion once the driving velocity exceeds a
critical threshold. In our system, this transition likely reflects
the onset of such coupling-induced instability, suggesting that
fluid feedback becomes dynamically significant beyond the
regime of quasi-planar propagation.

These findings indicate that the bend propagation observed
in our experiments can be parsimoniously explained by a

passive hydrodynamic mechanism. Once a local bend is
initiated near the base, distributed drag from the surrounding
water effectively suppresses the unactuated portions of the
arm and advects the bend distally along a nearly planar
path. The absence of propagation in air under identical
conditions (Gel 2 driven at 150 rpm), as shown in Fig-
ure. 8a, further supports this interpretation. In addition,
experiments in the attached video conducted in air with
driving speeds at 210, 270, and 330 rpm (see Figure. 8b)
revealed bend propagation patterns that differed substantially
from those observed in biological reaching, accompanied by
a marked increase in bend-point velocity [9]. This suggests
that, in the absence of fluid-mediated damping and added-
mass effects, the motion is dominated by direct mechanical
inertia rather than hydrodynamic coupling. Therefore, we
speculate that the surrounding fluid plays an important role
in shaping curvature propagation, consistent with previous
biological findings describing passive wave transmission in
“non-activated” octopus arm segments [3].

V. CONCLUSIONS

This study examined whip-like motions in a fluid environ-
ment and showed that, while the Gel 2 arm driven at 150
rpm reproduces a curvature evolution that resembles octopus
reaching, the bend-point velocity decays monotonically and
therefore does not exhibit the bell-shaped temporal profile
characteristic of biological reaching. Together with the ab-
sence of bend propagation in air, these findings indicate
that the observed propagation is dominated by buoyancy,
passive hydrodynamics and fluid—structure interactions. In
this sense, our results offer a complementary perspective on
why reaching is not a simple whipping behavior.

Beyond this conceptual point, our experiments reveal how
material properties and driving speed bound the envelope
of curvature propagation, with Gel 2 and 150 rpm offering
the most biological like spatial propagation among the tested
conditions. The methodology—combining controlled actua-
tion, underwater trials, and quantitative curvature and veloc-
ity analyses—provides a simple and reproducible platform
for quantitative, reaching-like kinematic studies. We antic-
ipate that this platform can support deeper hydrodynamics
research on reaching movements, including systematic stud-
ies of medium viscosity, arm geometry, and input shaping.
