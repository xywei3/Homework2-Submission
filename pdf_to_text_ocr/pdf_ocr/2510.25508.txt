Abstract: Mid-infrared (mid-IR) emission resonating with molecular vibration is one of the
important pathways to deliver heat energy required for various chemical reactions. However, its
practical applications have been limited due to the lack of high-power large-area mid-IR sources
so far. Here we report that graphene layers coupled with the vibrational excitation modes of
substrates can generate intense mid-IR radiation at high bias. This is potentially related to the
high-current driven nonequilibrium phenomena, where sonic-boom-like shock waves at the
graphene/substrate interface can induce the overflow of excited molecular vibrations in
substrates followed by spontaneous or stimulated transitions to ground states. The resulting mid-
IR radiation is highly efficient in thermal energy generation and transfer, which is expected to
significantly reduce power consumption in homes and industries.

One-Sentence Summary: Highly biased graphene on a substrate induces the overflow of
vibrational excitation, followed by intense mid-IR emission.
Main Text:

In electrothermal devices, a high-resistance material generates heat energy as electric current
flows through it, a process known as Joule heating, followed by energy transfer through
conduction, convection, and radiation (/). In particular, a Joule-heated nichrome wire delivers its
energy mainly by conduction or convection rather than blackbody radiation in near-infrared
(near-IR) ranges that depend only on temperature, i.e., the kinetic energy of molecules. On the
other hand, mid-infrared (mid-IR) radiation can be easily absorbed and emitted in resonance with
molecular vibrations, which play an important role in some dissociative chemical reactions.

In general, chemical reactions are proceeded under conditions of thermodynamic
equilibrium depending mostly on temperature and pressure, wherein the supplied energy is
distributed among all degrees of freedom—including translation, vibration, and rotation—and
across the entire system beyond the molecules of interest. In contrast, mid-IR radiation can target
specific molecular vibrations in the reaction pathway, minimizing the energy required for
activation and completion (2,/4). However, the power of the broadband mid-IR sources is
limited below ~50 W, so their large-scale applications have not been successfully demonstrated
(5).

Graphene, a two-dimensional carbon allotrope with excellent electrical, optical, and
plasmonic properties, has recently emerged as a versatile platform for active photonics in the
mid-IR spectral range (3-8). The collective oscillations of free carriers in graphene, known as
graphene plasmons, offer extremely strong electromagnetic field confinement and tunability via
electrostatic doping. These features have enabled new opportunities in subwavelength light
manipulation and enhanced light—matter interactions relevant to molecular sensing and infrared
photodetection (9-3). However, conventional excitation of graphene plasmons typically requires
external optical sources, such as mid-IR lasers or broadband lamps, which impose constraints on
device complexity, footprint, and scalability. Recent advances have demonstrated that electrical
biasing can directly induce localized electric fields and generate high-energy non-equilibrium
carriers—so-called hot carriers—in graphene, activating plasmonic modes without the need for
external illumination (/6, /7). However, generating plasmonic emission from graphene requires
complex patterning or device fabrication, which makes it challenging to control the wavelengths.

On the other hand, it was reported that Cherenkov-like electron-phonon instability can be
induced when the drift velocity of electrons exceeds the sound velocity in graphene (~18~22
km/s), resulting in the occurrence of sonic-boom-like shock waves, followed by amplified
phonon emission (8, /8). In this case, the carrier mobility of graphene needs to be higher than
~100,000 cm?/s:V, which is hardly achievable without using exfoliated graphene and proper h-
BN encapsulations (8). Alternatively, we can expect similar electron-phonon instability between
the graphene layer and the substrate, because the electrons in atomically thin graphene are
considerably bound to the substrate. As the sound velocity of typical substrates (polymers or
glass) are much slower (2~5 km/s) than that in graphene, Cherenkov-like emission can be
activated at moderate bias voltages, resulting in shock-wave acoustic energy flooding into
vibrationally excited modes of substrate materials. In this case, the wavelengths of the amplified
mid-IR emission must be the same as the absorption wavelengths (Av = +1), and the emission
wavelength can be adjusted by selecting specific materials with desired absorption-emission
characteristics in the mid-IR range (Fig. 1A). Figs. 1B and 1C show 3 layers (3L) of graphene
transferred to polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyimide (PI) films, respectively, where

-
150 nm thick Au electrodes are thermally deposited. For more practical applications, the 3L

graphene are layer-by-layer transferred to an A4-sized ceramic glass substrate as shown in Fig.
1D.

Fig. 2. Mid-IR spectral analysis of the Joule-heating graphene on various substrates. (A) Mid-IR
spectra of the graphene/PI heater with increasing bias from 40 to 160 V. The sharp emission peaks spanning
2.5—5.0 tum are symmetric to the IR absorption peaks of PI. (B, C), Mid-IR intensity with respect to bias
voltage and temperature, respectively. Here, the peak at 3.624 ttm was used for quantitative analysis. (D)
Mid-IR spectra of the graphene/PET heater with increasing bias from 25 to 70 V. The emission peak
positions are almost identical with the discrete molecular absorption peaks of PET. (E) Mid-IR spectra of
the graphene/ceramic-glass heater with increasing bias from 60 to 250 V, showing broad bands rather than
sharp peaks.

The mid-IR analysis for the Joule-heating graphene on polyimide (PI) shows that the
shape of emission peaks is almost identical to that of IR absorption peaks of PI except for
ambient CO? absorption peaks appearing at 4.2~4.3 um (Fig. 2A), indicating that the mid-IR
emissions are originated from transition between the molecular vibration energy levels of PI (Av
= +1). The mid-IR intensity with respect to applied voltage and temperature increase drastically
after ~120 V or ~300 °C (Figs. 2B, C), potentially due to thermally induced structural changes.
Specifically, mechanical softening of a polymer reduces its Young’s modulus and consequently
lowers the acoustic sound velocity (22-24). Additionally, the carrier drift velocity within the
crystalline domains of graphene can be higher than the electrically measured carrier velocity
traveling across the multi domains, further facilitating the onset of the electron-phonon
instability at lower voltages (25, 26).

Comparison between graphene/PI and Ni-Cr heaters with similar power consumption (~300W). (C) Mid-

utilized as a blank substrate for electrothermal vibrational excitation. (D) Mid-IR spectra from PI placed on

emission spectra of any unknown sample can be measured simply by placing it on the graphene/quartz
heater plate using the spectra in C (graphene/quartz) as a reference. (E) Thickness-dependent mid-IR
spectra of PDMS on graphene/quartz substrates: 200 jum thick PDMS shows broad peaks around 2750—
3200 cm™. (F) ~25 yum thick PDMS exhibits a sharp peak at ~2970 cm; the inset in A shows the spectra
of 10 um thick PDMS only. The spectral contribution from the graphene/quartz is subtracted as a blank
reference. This indicates that the mid-IR emission spectra of any unknown sample can be measured simply
by placing it on the graphene/quartz heater plate using the spectra in C (graphene/quartz) as a reference.

The similarity between the emission and absorption peaks was also observed in the
graphene/PET heater (Fig. 2D). On the other hand, the ceramic glass requires higher bias voltage
for the onset of increasing emission, showing broad emission bands rather than sharp peaks (Fig.
2E), which is possibly due to the higher sound velocity in glass materials (~5 km/s) and their
random molecular network structures. The emission spectra measured from the graphene-
transferred side and the opposite side are nearly identical (Supplementary Fig. S2), indicating
that the vibrational excitation is not limited to the interfacial area and propagates throughout the
substrate (27, 28).

Fig. 3A shows the strong mid-IR peaks related to C-H/N-H stretching and C=C
conjugation begins to appear above ~SO0V, implying that the radiation is changing from
blackbody to molecular vibration regimes as the charge carriers’ drifting velocity increases close
to the sound velocity. Fig. 3B clearly shows the mid-IR radiation of the Joule-heated graphene
on PI is clearly different from Ni-Cr coil heaters. The mid-IR emission spectra of DC and AC
powered graphene/PI heaters vary by positions between the electrodes. For DC, emission
intensifies from left to right due to accelerated carriers under electric field (Supplementary Fig.
S3A). For AC, the highest mid-IR intensity occurs at the center (Supplementary Fig. $3B).

We also investigated the mid-IR emission from a sandwiched structure
(substrate/graphene/substrate). The electrothermal device of 3L graphene on a quartz plate is
prepared first, and 50 tum PI film placed on a graphene/quartz substate, which shows clear
vibrational peaks from both PI and quartz. (Fig. 3D), indicating that both sides of the graphene
layers interact independently with the upper and lower substrates to generate intrinsic vibrational
emission.

In addition, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was spin-coated on the graphene/quartz
substrate at the rate of 500 and 3,500 rpm for 60 seconds, resulting in the thicknesses of ~200 pm
and 25, uum, respectively. The electrically induced vibrational mid-IR emission (~2970 cm"! for
C-H stretching) looks sharp for 25 tum thick PDMS, while broader peaks and bands appear for
the 200 um PDMS (Fig. 3E, F). This implies that the mean-free-path of shockwave-induced
molecular vibrational excitation and emission can be tens of um long. The vibrational emission
increases linearly with applied voltages, because the sound velocity in mechanically soft PDMS
(elastomer) is as low as ~1 km/s, which doesn’t require the onset voltage as high as those of
relatively rigid PI and PET.

Fig. 4. Radiative contribution of thermal energy generated by the graphene heater compared with
conventional sheath and SUS heaters. (A, C) Radiative power contribution of different heat sources
compared at the constant temperature (250°C) and total power (50 W), respectively. The heater dimensions
are identical (135 x 150 mm’). (B, D) The radiative thermal energy absorbed by a blackbody-like black-
coated aluminum plate with respect to the distance between the source and detector in a vacuum chamber
(excluding conductive and convective heat transfer) at the constant temperature (250°C) and power (50 W),
respectively. The dashed lines are fitted by inverse-square-law.

To quantify mid-infrared (mid-IR) radiative heat, experiments were conducted in a
vacuum chamber to minimize conductive and convective heat transfer. For comparison, sheath
heaters and stainless-steel (SUS) heaters were used as reference heat sources, and the total
radiative output relative to the total power of each heater was calculated using the Stefan—
Boltzmann law. A black-coated aluminium plate, serving as a quasi-blackbody absorber, was
used to determine the received radiative energy via energy conservation (q = m:c:-4T). Figs. 4A
and B show the radiative output relative to the total power and the received thermal energy with
respect to increasing distance, respectively, for a fixed surface temperature at 250°C. The
graphene heater exhibited ~ 4-fold higher radiative output compared to the sheath heater and ~ 5-
fold higher than the SUS heater. Fig. 4C and 4D present the radiative output at a fixed power of
50 W. The graphene heater showed ~1.6 times higher radiative output than the sheath heater and
~5.4 times higher than the SUS heater. Despite having a lower surface temperature than the
sheath heater, the received radiative energy from the graphene heater was ~1.3 times higher, and
~1.2 times higher than the SUS heater at comparable surface temperatures. These results indicate
that the graphene heater exhibits enhanced radiative heat generation and transfer in the mid-IR
ranges, delivering approximately fivefold greater emission per unit area than conventional
heaters at the optimized distance and environment.
Thus, we conclude that electrically biased carriers excite the vibrational modes of
substrates, producing sharp mid-IR emission peaks that differ fundamentally from conventional
blackbody radiation that increases smoothly with temperature. Two key observations confirm the
non-thermal nature: (i) exponential growth of emission with both voltage and temperature, and (ii)
peak positions coinciding with vibrational absorptions of distinct substrates. The former suggests
a threshold behavior consistent with Cherenkov-like instability, where the electron’s drift velocity
must surpass the substrate's sound velocity. The material-specific amplified spontaneous mid-IR
emission, revealed by peak alignment with substrate vibrational modes, rules out generic thermal
emission.

We suppose that the mechanism arises from synergistic feedback: accelerated charge
carriers in graphene inject energy into non-equilibrium phonons in a substrate, while softening
by Joule-heating lowers sound velocity and enables more efficient excitation. This positive
feedback makes the emission intensities increase exponentially with both voltage and
temperature for conventional polymers. However, the elastomers with intrinsically lower sound
velocity tend to show linear dependence between emission intensity and applied voltage.
Importantly this effect renders the excitation volumetric, spanning entire substrates rather than
being confined to the graphene interface.

In summary, a non-traditional mid-IR emission path is found in graphene Joule-heaters,
which uniquely demonstrates the electrically driven non-thermal emission mechanism appearing
above the onset bias voltage for non-elastomers. The graphene heaters with long-term stability
enable energy-efficient heating with better uniformity. Given the unique features of
electrothermal graphene platforms: atomic thickness, transparency, flexibility and wavelength-
tunability, our findings are expected to open a new era of wavelength-selective and energy-
efficient mid-IR heating technology that can significantly reduce power consumption of
electrothermal devices in homes and industries, replacing traditional high-resistance coil-heater
technologies discovered a century ago.

Fabrication

A copper (Cu) foil (10 x 10 cm’) was placed in a quartz tube, and heated to 1000 °C
under the flow of 5 sccm (standard cubic centimeter per minute) of hydrogen (H2) gas for 100
min. Synthesis was performed under 50 sccm of methane (CH4) gas, 5 sccm of Hz gas and 100
sccm Ar gas for 30 min. After growth, the graphene film grown on copper foil is attached to a
thermal release tape by applying soft pressure (0.2 MPa) between two rollers. After etching the
copper foil in a plastic bath filled with copper etchant, the transferred graphene film on the tape
is rinsed with deionized water to remove residual etchant, and is then ready to be transferred to
any kind of substrates. The graphene film on the thermal release tape is inserted between the
rollers together with a target substrate and exposed to mild heat (90-120 °C), resulting in the
transfer of the graphene films from the tape to the target substrates. By repeating these steps on
the same substrate, multilayered graphene films can be prepared.*! And gold electrodes were

carrier (hole) mobility (42) of the CVD graphene is around 2,000~3,000 cm?/s-V, and the carrier
concentration (7) is 3.6 x 10!? cm, the carrier velocity can exceed the sound velocity of
substrate polymers or glass (1~5 km/s) when 100~300 V is applied across the 3 x 3 cm” graphene
heater device.

MIR emission measurements

Voltage was applied to the fabricated electrodes using a power supply, and the resulting
emission spectrum was measured in the mid-infrared (MIR) range using a NLIR $2050 Mid-
Infrared Spectrometer.

Cooking Applications

A cooking process involves numerous chemical reactions such as Maillard reaction,
protein denaturation, caramelization, efc., where chemical bonds in food ingredients are broken
down. In this regard, the vibrational mid-IR heating is expected to be advantageous particularly
for cookers that are known as one of the most energy-consuming electronic appliances. For this
reason, we tried to utilize the mid-IR emitting graphene heaters for cooking applications (Fig.

Sl).

A toaster, coffee, and bread are heated using 3L graphene-laminated ceramic glass
powered by alternating current (1A, 220V, 60Hz) (Fig. S1 and 82). It turns out the power
consumption of the toaster is ~20% less than that of conventional toasters (Fig. 12B).
Conventional cookers consume more than ~1.3 kW, but the graphene cooker uses almost half of
the electrical power (<700W) for similar capacity and heating rate (Fig. SIE, F). Importantly, the
graphene-heated samples exhibited significantly more uniform internal coloration, indicative of
volumetric mid-IR vibrational heating. The mid-IR wavelength of 2.5—5.0 um couples strongly
with the fundamental vibrational modes of molecular bonds prevalent in food matrices, such as
O-H stretching in water (~2.7—3.5 sm), C—H stretching in lipids (~3.3 um), and C=O stretching
in proteins and carbohydrates (~5.0 jm). These resonant interactions lead to localized excitation
of molecular vibrations at the surface and near-surface regions, which efficiently initiates
chemical transformations, such as Maillard browning, starch gelatinization, and protein

13
denaturation. The energy deposited in these vibrations is subsequently transferred through
thermal conduction, promoting a more uniform distribution of heat throughout the bulk and
enabling more homogeneous cooking compared with conduction-only heating (Fig. S1E, F).

As a result, the synergistic effect of direct vibrational excitation and substrate heating in
the graphene cooker yields both energy savings and improved culinary quality. In particular, the
colours for the graphene-cooked vegetables are homogeneously changed from their native
colours, implying that the mid-IR emission energy is homogeneously delivered to foods without
much energy loss to environment by conduction or convection. In addition, the graphene heaters
exhibited excellent long-term reliability, and the resistance remained constant within +3% after
1,000 cycles of 60 min heating and 20 min cooling (Fig. S$1C). Moreover, all-around transparent
windows enable real-time monitoring of cooking processes and provide better opportunity for
design innovations (Fig. $1D).
