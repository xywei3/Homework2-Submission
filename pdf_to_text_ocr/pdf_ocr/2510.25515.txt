ABSTRACT

The Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (SO/PHI) onboard Solar Orbiter is a spectropolarimeter scanning the Fe 1 line at 617.3
nm, providing data of the solar photosphere. The same line is sampled by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and many other on-ground instruments. In this paper, we aim at assessing the consistency between
line-of-sight (LoS) velocity measurements from the two instruments. Reliable measurements of up and down flows from SO/PHI are
crucial and unique when Solar Orbiter is facing the far side of the Sun. Also, a combination of measurements from two vantage points
to study horizontal flows must rely on consistent observations. For this purpose, we compare the LoS velocity measured by SO/PHI’s
High Resolution Telescope (SO/PHI-HRT) and SDO/HMI on 29 March 2023, when Solar Orbiter was crossing the Sun-Earth line
at a distance of 0.39 au from the Sun. Because such co-alignments are rare, this configuration offered an almost unique opportunity
to directly compare data products from both telescopes. The data are aligned and remapped to allow a pixel-by-pixel comparison of
the whole time series of 4 hours length. Temporal and spatial variations are considered for a direct combination of the measurements.
The LoS velocity distributions are evaluated and a clear linear relation is found between the two instruments with a slope of 0.94 and
a correlation of 90%. We find that the signals form at similar heights, with a separation of 10+12 km, which is larger than previous
estimates. A close-up look at the penumbra of a sunspot and its Evershed flow is presented. We conclude that the signals inferred by
SO/PHI-HRT and SDO/HMI show very good agreement and high correlation when instrumental effects and large-scale velocities on
the Sun are properly accounted for.

w-— 1. Introduction

The Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (SO/PHI, Solanki
et al. 2020) onboard Solar Orbiter (Miiller et al. 2020) is the first
spectropolarimetric imager to observe the Sun from a vantage
point lying outside the Sun-Earth line. Two telescopes are part of
the instrument, a Full Disk Telescope (SO/PHI-FDT) and a High
Resolution Telescope (SO/PHI-HRT, Gandorfer et al. 2018),
which both provide measurements of the photospheric magnetic
field vector, continuum intensity and line-of-sight (LoS) velocity
in the solar photosphere. Only a few other satellites have instru-
ments capable of retrieving these photospheric quantities, such
as the Spectropolarimeter instrument (SP, Lites et al. 2013) of
the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT, Tsuneta et al. 2008) onboard
Hinode (Kosugi et al. 2007), the Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/HMI,
Schou et al. 2012; Pesnell et al. 2012), and the Full-Disk Vector
MagnetoGraph onboard the Advanced Space-Based Solar Ob-
servatory (ASO-S/FMG, Bai et al. 2024; Gan et al. 2023).
Despite the clear advantages of satellite observations, such
as the absence of the disturbance from the Earth’s atmosphere
and the possibility of uninterrupted data acquisition, many chal-

lenges have to be faced to achieve a consistent data reduction. In
the case of SO/PHI the highly eccentric orbit and low teleme-
try periods when the spacecraft is at more than | au from Earth,
make the SO/PHI data reduction considerably more challeng-
ing. On the other hand, SO/PHI can for the very first time mea-
sure the photospheric properties of the Sun from different view-
points than Earth-bound observatories (Miiller et al. 2020). This
unique orbit opens the possibility for novel scientific applica-
tions, such as building fast synoptic maps of the LoS magnetic
field (Loeschl et al. 2024b,a) or direct combination of intensity
and magnetic field data in stereoscopic configuration (e.g. Val-
ori et al. 2023; Albert et al. 2023; Romero Avila et al. 2024).
Comparisons of the magnetic field vector between SO/PHI and
SDO/HMI have been carried out by Sinjan et al. (2023) and
Moreno Vacas et al. (2024) to assess the similarity between the
data products of these two instruments. Such inter-instrument
comparisons are fundamental for combining data from differ-
ent vantage points, particularly when tracking features on the far
side of the Sun (e.g. Finley et al. 2025).

The same approach can be applied to the photospheric flows
measured by multiple instruments. Dopplergrams are a crucial
data product to study the emergence of active regions (e.g. Lites
et al. 1998), waves (Jess et al. 2023), or the dynamics of the mag-
netic field in active regions (e.g. Kazachenko et al. 2015). Pro-

viding high quality data comparable to other spectropolarime-
ters will be a key element for studying the evolution of active
regions for more than half of the solar rotation and for disen-
tangling horizontal from vertical flows by combining data from
different vantage points.

This work focuses on the comparison of the LoS velocity
field measured by SO/PHI-HRT and SDO/HML. In Section 2 we
describe the data used for this work. In Section 3 the method
used for the remapping of the data is explained in detail. The
results are shown in Section 4 and the discussion and summary
are presented in Section 5.

2. Data

The observations analyzed in this work were acquired while
Solar Orbiter was in inferior conjunction (along the Sun-Earth
line) with Earth on 29 March 2023 during the Solar Orbiter Ob-
serving Plan RLSMALL_HRES_HCAD_RS-burst (Zouganelis
et al. 2020). This orbital configuration gives us the opportunity
to have Earth-bound and Solar Orbiter instruments observing the
Sun from an almost identical viewing angle. Here we focus on
the comparison of SO/PHI-HRT and SDO/HMI. Both telescopes
scan the Fe 1 absorption line at 617.3 nm with the same angu-
lar resolution, although this translates to different spatial reso-
lutions on the photosphere due to the different distances of the
telescopes from the Sun, which varies greatly along Solar Or-
biter’s orbit. Information about the observation employed in this
paper can be found in Table 1, such as the time of the acquisi-
tion, the NOAA number of the observed sunspot, cadence, pixel
scale, and the position of the spacecraft. More information about
the technical comparison between the two telescopes is provided
in Sinjan et al. (2023).

An overview of the data is shown in Fig. 1. The top panels
display the continuum intensity and LoS velocity as measured by
SO/PHI-HRT, the bottom panel depicts the LoS magnetic field
as seen from both instruments, with the SO/PHI-HRT FoV in-
dicated by the yellow box in the SDO/HMI magnetogram. All
the panels are shown in the respective detector frame, which
means that the SO/PHI-HRT y axis is roughly aligned with the
north-south direction and SDO/HMI is rotated by approximately
180°(as shown by the arrows in the bottom panels). The data
products chosen for this comparison are the 45 s cadence data
products of SDO/HMI (based on the so-called MDI-like algo-
rithm, Couvidat et al. 2016) and the newly improved standard
results of the SO/PHI-HRT pipeline (Sinjan et al. 2022; Kahil
et al. 2022; Bailén et al. 2024), which is now also correcting for
residual stray light, based on the inversion of the radiative trans-

fer equations (RTE) in Milne-Eddington approximation with the
MILOS code (Orozco Suarez & Del Toro Iniesta 2007). This
data product became the standard data product in most recent
data releases! (see Sinjan et al. in preparation, for more details).

We post-process the SO/PHI-HRT data with the method de-
scribed in Calchetti et al. (2023), which mainly consists of align-
ing the whole time series and temporally interpolating each
frame of the Stokes vector to the same observing time. For con-
sistency, instead of a linear interpolation we use an apodized nor-
malized sinc function. The choice is motivated by using a simi-
lar function to that in the SDO/HMI pipeline (Martinez Oliveros
et al. 2011), even though no significant dependence is found of
the results presented in this work on the employed interpolation
scheme.

3. Remapping and alignment

An accurate alignment of the whole time series is needed for
a pixel-by-pixel comparison. The procedure described below is
applied to every SO/PHI-HRT observation (240 in total), which
is then associated to the closest SDO/HMI dataset in time. Dif-
ferences in light travel times are also considered when selecting
the SDO/HMI dataset.

Firstly, the World Coordinate System (WCS) of SO/PHI-
HRT is updated to compensate for three so far unaccounted con-
tributions to the nominal spacecraft pointing: the tracking of the
image stabilization system, the translation of the field of view
(FoV) due to the change in the focus position, and the pointing
inaccuracy of the spacecraft itself. Other residuals coming from

small variations in the instrument bore-sight are also compen-
sated. The alignment is achieved via cross-correlation between
the continuum intensity maps of SO/PHI-HRT and SDO/HMI,
with the latter remapped on the SO/PHI-HRT detector frame.
This procedure is repeated iteratively while updating the WCS
information to account for the misalignment found with the
cross-correlation until the obtained shift is smaller then a hun-
dredth of a pixel.

Secondly, we compensate for geometrical distortions in the
SO/PHI-HRT FoV. This step starts by cropping the SDO/HMI
time series to the desired FoV (see the yellow box in Fig. 1)
and by tracking the sunspot in the center of the FoV at the
Carrington rotation rate, similar to the mtrack module in the
SDO/HMI pipeline. We then destretch the SO/PHI-HRT LoS
magnetic field map, remapped onto the cropped SDO/HMI de-
tector frame, with respect to the corresponding SDO/HMI mag-
netogram. The pixel-by-pixel shifts obtained by this destretching
algorithm are then applied in the algorithm that remaps SO/PHI-
HRT onto the SDO/HMI detector frame with a cubic interpo-
lation. Such a procedure can be applied only when the angular
separation of the two instruments is close to 0°, where differ-
ences in viewing geometry are minimized, and is necessary to
remove any residual geometrical distortion in the FoV.

Lastly, before remapping the SO/PHI-HRT LoS velocity
on the SDO/HMI image plane, we convolve the SO/PHI-HRT
Dopplergram with the SDO/HMI theoretical point spread func-
tion (PSF) and removed the LoS photospheric large scale veloc-

ity components (LSC) in the data, including solar differential ro-
tation, spacecraft velocity, meridional flow, convective blueshift,
and gravitational redshift (see Schuck et al. 2016; Castellanos
Duran et al. 2021, for details). The LSC are also removed from
the SDO/HMI Dopplergrams. More information on the equa-
tions used for the LSC are given in Appendix A. The final result
consists of 240 SO/PHI-HRT Dopplergrams of 440x440 pixels
remapped onto the SDO/HMI detector frame. We will refer to
this time series from now on as remapped SO/PHI-HRT. The
cadence of this time series is still 60 s, but the SDO/HMI time
series has an irregular cadence in order to always consider the
closest dataset in time taking into consideration the difference in
light travel time. Basically, since we consider the 45 s nominal
SDO/HMI cadence, we excluded one of every four datasets. As a
consequence, the time difference between the SO/PHI-HRT and
SDO/HMI Dopplergrams alternates between approximately 20,
5, and 10 s repetitively.

4. Results

Different types of comparisons are reported in this section. Tak-
ing advantage of the sub-pixel accuracy in the alignment of the
time series, we study the differences between velocities mea-
sured by the two instruments in space, time, and in the Fourier
space on a pixel by pixel basis. Such studies are possible only
with an accurate alignment of the data, as described in Sect. 3,
which is crucial to reveal both global and localized discrepancies
in the data.

A mask excluding 50 pixels at the edges of the FoV is ap-
plied to avoid missing SO/PHI-HRT data caused by the align-
ment and remapping of the time series. In addition, we examine
the sunspot penumbra region in more detail.

4.1. Fourier space

The comparison between two time series in the Fourier space
can be addressed by means of the k-w diagrams (see Jafarzadeh
et al. 2025 for a description of this method). Best accuracy is
attained by using two time series with the same spatial resolu-
tion, cadence, and size. The SDO/HMI time series constructed
for our study has an irregular cadence which has to be corrected
for this analysis (see Section 3). To do that, we reduce the full
45 s cadence SDO/HMI observation to the 60 s SO/PHI-HRT
cadence by removing the highest frequencies in Fourier space,
keeping the same starting and ending time of the original series,
which means that there is still a (constant) time difference of
20.5 s with respect to the SO/PHI-HRT time series. This resam-
pled time series is not used for the pixel-by-pixel comparison to
avoid any spurious result that might have been generated by this
procedure.

The power spectra of the remapped SO/PHI-HRT and
SDO/HMI time series and their phase difference and coherence
spectrum are shown in Fig. 2. The phase difference has been
corrected for the time difference between the two time series.
The coherence spectrum shows the linear relation between two
signals and it is not affected by their amplitude (Vigeesh et al.
2017). The first thing to notice is the similarity between the
power spectra of the two instruments, which is made more evi-
dent by the diagrams showing the phase difference and the coher-
ence between the two time series. The phase difference remains
consistently close to 0° across most of the domain, while the
coherence spectrum shows very high values (above 80%) along
the p-modes and f-mode ridges and in the internal gravity waves
and granulation regime. The phase difference diagrams can be

used to estimate the average height difference between the two
signals (see equations (2) and (3) in Vesa et al. 2023). We se-
lect the area of the diagram where the waves have real vertical
wavenumber, which means that they propagate and they are not
evanescent (as when the vertical wave number is imaginary). We
can then restrict our choice only to vertically propagating waves
by considering only small horizontal wavenumbers (see the red
dashed box in the bottom right panel in Fig. 2). We assume the
cut-off frequency, buoyancy frequency, and sound speed to be
equal to 5.4 mHz, 4.9 mHz, and 7 km/s respectively. We find
that the SO/PHI-HRT signal forms approximately 10 km above
SDO/HMI, with a broad distribution between -10 and 30 km.
Previous result by Schou et al. (2023) suggested a formation
height of ~156 km for SDO/HMI and ~158 km above the solar
surface for SO/PHI obtained with the help of a MURaM simula-
tion. This result was obtained by retrieving the velocity through
the MDI-like algorithm also for SO/PHI, so we would expect
those signals to be closer than those addressed in that work.

4.2. Distributions

As a second assessment of the similarity of the SDO/HMI and
SO/PHI-HRT Dopplergrams, a scatter plot of the remapped
SO/PHI-HRT and the non-interpolated SDO/HMI time series is
shown in Fig. 3. Only the datasets with time difference of 5 s are
selected for plotting in this figure because the width of the distri-
bution is affected by the time discrepancy. The colors correspond
to the number of points inside a specific bin in logarithmic scale.
Two functions have been fit to this distribution: a linear func-
tion and a 2-D Gaussian distribution. The linear fit shows a clear
correspondence between the data, with a slope of 0.94, a correla-
tion coefficient of 90%, and an offset of -203 m/s. The Gaussian
distribution indicates the spread between the two signals, which
is 132 m/s at lo. We also determine the mean of the distribu-

tion, which provides information on the offset of the zero point
between both time series. The average of the distribution for
SDO/HML is at -195 m/s, whereas the SO/PHI-HRT mean value
is at -7 m/s. Discussing the absolute calibration of these instru-
ments is a challenge that goes beyond the scope of this work, but
it is indeed a point that needs to be mentioned. In the SDO/HMI
case, the reference velocity can be set in many ways available
in the literature (e.g. Mathew et al. 2003; Grigor’ev et al. 2011;
Okamoto et al. 2009; de la Cruz Rodriguez et al. 2011; Welsch
et al. 2013), including simply setting the mean signal at the cen-
ter of the Sun to zero (after the removal of all the LSC). The
same approach is not always possible for SO/PHI-HRT, due to
its smaller FoV and the fact that it often points such that solar
disk center does not lie in its FoV.

To investigate the presence of any temporal dependence, we
repeated the analysis described above for each of the 240 frames
separately. Fig. 4 shows a selection of fit parameters as a func-
tion of time. The top panel displays the results of the linear fit
on each of the 240 observation pairs of frames. The blue points
show the slope and the orange points the offset obtained by the
linear fit. We can clearly distinguish a linear trend through the

fit. The blue and red contours show the -200 and +200 G values of the

4 hours of observation in which both values evolve towards a
better concordance. The middle panel depicts the coordinates of
the average of the Gaussian distribution. The left axis (in green,
x coordinates of the center of the distribution) corresponds to the
mean values of each dataset of the remapped SO/PHI-HRT, the

right coordinates (in red, y coordinates of the center of the distri-
bution) to SDO/HMI. The range of the two y-axes is the same for
both coordinates, meaning that the relative variation with time of
both values is directly comparable. In this case, the SDO/HMI
values do not show any significant variation with time, while
the remapped SO/PHI-HRT values go from 0 to -15 m/s. The
bottom panel shows the root mean square (rms) of the remapped
SO/PHI-HRT (purple) and SDO/HMI (brown) time series, which
is used to quantify the amplitudes measured by the instruments.
The two axes in this case are exactly the same for both distri-
butions. The remapped SO/PHI-HRT rms is overall higher than
SDO/HMI as expected by the slope of the linear fit shown in
Fig. 3 being smaller than one. On the other hand, we see a de-
crease of the rms in SO/PHI-HRT of ~5 m/s and an increase in
SDO/HMI of ~10 m/s, which is also consistent with the increase
of the slope in time.

In a further step we look at the spatial variation of the re-
sults of the linear fit. For that, the FoV is divided into square
regions of 8x8 pixels and we perform a linear fit in each of these
regions through the whole time series. We also compute the aver-
aged correlation between the two time series in each sub-region.
The results are shown in Fig. 5. The top panel shows the spatial-
distribution of the correlation, which is overall very high with a
mean value of 91%. Low values are found especially within the
sunspot umbra, where the correlation drops to 60-70%. Many
factors lead to this low correlation including the low intensity
signal, the large line splitting due to the strong magnetic field
that can become as large as the total wavelength range in the line
that is scanned, the small velocity in the umbra, the few mea-
sured wavelength points within the line (which are different for
SDO/HMI and SO/PHI), different algorithms to retrieve the ve-
locity signal, all contribute to the low correlations between the
two instruments within umbrae (see Sect. 5).

The middle and bottom panels show the spatial distribution
of the slope and offset of the linear fit. Here a spatial distribution
is quite evident, particularly in the case of the offset. The FoV
dependence is likely due to calibration residuals, such as an im-
perfect treatment of the prefilter, etalon cavity correction, or flat
correction in SO/PHI-HRT. The spatial variation does not show
any correlation with any of the LSC of either instruments and
the amplitude of the signal also does not match with any of the
known effects that we compensate for. Note that in the middle
panel of Fig. 5 low values of the slope are seen in large parts of
the sunspot including parts of the penumbra. This is an artifact
of the averaging onto larger pixels, which mixes the low (and
uncertain) slope values found in the umbra with the high values
in the penumbra (see Sect. 4.3)

4.3. Sunspot penumbra

In this section the penumbra of the sunspot is analyzed in more
detail. The penumbra is defined as those pixels with intensity
higher than 55% and lower than 89% of the averaged intensity
continuum in a nearby quiet Sun area. A reproduction of the scat-
ter plot between the remapped SO/PHI-HRT and the SDO/HMI
time series, focusing exclusively on the penumbra and on its Ev-
ershed flow (Evershed 1909) is visible in Fig. 6. The contours
defining the penumbra boundaries are also visible in the lower
right part of the same figure. It is evident that the scatter of
the points is smaller than in Fig. 3, which can be explained by
the smaller FoV considered here (and thus smaller spatial varia-
tion) and is well represented by the higher correlation coefficient
(95%) with respect to that of the full FoV. Another remarkable
result is the slope of the linear fit, which does not differ from the

one obtained by fitting the data of the whole FoV. This is un-
likely to be by chance given the small error bars associated with
each data point. Additionally, the offset between the two signals
is smaller than that found in Fig. 3. This is expected from the
position of the sunspot in the bottom panel of Fig. 5, where it
lies in an area where the offset is smaller than the average (as
obtained by the linear fit shown in Fig. 3).

After assessing that the velocities measured in the penumbra
are comparable to those in the rest of the FoV, the comparison
of the spatial dependence of the Evershed flow recorded by the
two instruments can be addressed. Therefore, an elliptical polar
grid is defined to encompass the whole penumbra and its Ever-
shed flow, which extends slightly beyond the outer edge of the
penumbra. The grid is shown as gray lines in the left panel of
Fig. 7. The solid gray ellipses show the starting and ending point
of the radial distance. The azimuth angle axis is defined starting
from the straight solid line in counter-clockwise direction with a
5° step size.

The middle panel of Fig. 7 displays the velocity on the el-
liptical polar grid. Note that the velocities plotted in this panel
are temporal averages over the full 240 frames recorded by the
SO/PHI-HRT. The two branches of the Evershed flow are clearly
visible in the left and right part of the plot, which consists of the
limb (outlined by the red box) and disk center (blue box) oriented
sides of the penumbra, respectively. In order to compare the val-
ues obtained by the two instruments, we perform an azimuthal
average (along the x axis) in the red and blue boxes for each time
series. The results are shown in the right panel of Fig. 7, where
the x axis represents the radial distance on the elliptical polar
grid. The colors are the same as of the boxes shown in the mid-
dle panel, the crosses show the result obtained with the remapped
SO/PHI-HRT and the circles those from SDO/HMI. The curves
resulting from the data of the two instruments lie very close to
each other until the penumbra-quiet Sun boundary (which lies
roughly at a distance of 15 px along the x axis). The asymmetry
between the two sides of the penumbra (limb- and disk center-
side, e.g. Schlichenmaier et al. 2004) is to be expected. Also, a
difference in the flows can be caused by the asymmetric shape of
the sunspot.

5. Discussion

We have reported a comparison of the LoS velocity measured by
SO/PHI-HRT and SDO/HMI while Solar Orbiter was in inferior
conjunction. The data acquired by SO/PHI-HRT have been post-
processed and remapped onto the SDO/HMI detector frame to
allow a pixel-by-pixel comparison. Despite differences in instru-
mentation, calibration, cadence, and velocity retrieval methods,
the comparison shows an excellent agreement of the LoS ve-
locity signals obtained with these two telescopes. We measure a
height difference of 10+12 km between the two time series and
obtain a slope of 0.94 for the linear fit of the scatter plot between
the two instruments and a correlation coefficient of above 90%.
The measured height difference is larger than the result obtained
from a MURaM simulation by Schou et al. (2023) and it is pos-
sible to estimate the velocity variation due to such a separation.
If we consider the conservation of mass from one layer to the
other, it holds

PHMIVHMI = PPHIVPHI ()

where p is the density at each layer and v is the vertical velocity.
A ratio vami/VpH of 0.95 for 10 km height separation is ob-
tained by considering the atmospheric densities from the VAL-
C model (Vernazza et al. 1981), whereas 11 km of separation

by the remapped SO/PHI-HRT (x axis) and SDO/HMI (y axis) in the
sunspot penumbra. The colors and lines are defined as in Fig. 3. The

would be necessary to obtain a ratio equals to 0.94. Considering
the broad distribution of the height separation between the two
instruments, it is not possible to address it as the unique cause
for having a ratio smaller than 1. One more reason is to be found
in the bottom panel of Fig. 4, which shows that the rms of the
remapped SO/PHI-HRT is always higher than that of SDO/HMI.
This is due to the spatial deconvolution of the SO/PHI-HRT PSF
including the stray light component during the data reduction, a
correction that is not included in the SDO/HMI pipeline, but it
can be made available on request. We compare these data with
the velocities from SDO/HMI without stray light removed, as
we want to compare the standard data products, which are the
most likely to be used for studies comparing or combing veloci-
ties from the two instruments. One more element that could also
contribute is the different sampling of the spectral line. SO/PHI-
HRT samples the line in five points with a spectral resolution
of 58000, SDO/HMI in six points with a spectral resolution of
81000. Stief et al. (2019) showed that the velocity retrieved with
different sampling and at different points along the line can sub-
stantially affect the measurement. However, a lower spectral res-
olution reduces the variation in the retrieved velocity near the
core of the line (see the yellow curve in Fig. 5 in Stief et al. 2019
for the SDO/HMI case), meaning that we do no expect this to
be the main component of the difference between the two instru-
ments.

The temporal variation of the linear and Gaussian fitting re-
sults (presented in Fig. 4) is mostly due to two factors: a variation
of ~10 m/s in the average distribution of the SO/PHI-HRT veloc-
ity field (middle panel) and the opposite variation of the rms of
the two instruments (bottom panel). The variation of the average
value in SO/PHI-HRT can be caused by the intrinsic sensitiv-
ity of the instrument, due to the voltage applied to the etalon,
which translates into ~17 m/s, and due to the thermal stabiliza-
tion, which converts into ~19 m/s. While the rms increase in
SDO/HMI is consistent with the findings of Oba et al. (2020),
the slow decrease in SO/PHI-HRT is likely due to the optical

Fig. 7. Left panel: remapped SO/PHI-HRT LoS velocity signal around the sunspot averaged in time (oriented as in Fig. 1). The black contours are
at 55% and 89% of the average continuum intensity. The gray lines show the grid used for the elliptical polar projection of the penumbra. The solid
gray ellipses are the starting and ending point of the radial distance axis, the solid straight gray line shows the starting point of the azimuth angle
axis (measured counter-clockwise). Middle panel: same signal as shown in the left panel, but represented on the elliptical polar grid displayed in
the left panel. The x axis shows the azimuth, the y axis shows the radial distance (in pixel) from the innermost ellipse. Right panel: azimuthal
average of the signal within the blue and red boxes of the middle panel. The crosses show the remapped SO/PHI-HRT signal, whereas the points
are the SDO/HMI signal. The colors correspond to the boxes shown in the middle panel. The values displayed in blue are multiplied by -1 for an

easier comparison.

quality of the data through the 4-hour observation. In particular,
a major component can be attributed to the focus of the instru-
ment, which changes with time because of the fast approach of
the spacecraft to the Sun and the associated thermal drifts. A
possible indication is the presence of the same decrease in the
unreconstructed SO/PHI-HRT LoS velocity data and in the in-
tensity contrast in the raw data. It is also important to point out
that the values of the slope are comparable to those of the ratio
between the SDO/HMI and SO/PHI-HRT rms. This can indicate
a possible strategy for directly combining the velocities mea-
sured by these two instruments when observing from different
vantage points.

The spatial correlation and dependence of the linear fitting
results are shown in Fig. 5. The correlation map shows very high
values through the whole FoV with an average of 91%, with the
exception of the sunspot umbra, where the measured LoS ve-
locities are generally lower than in the penumbra or quiet sun..
This can be expected by the different algorithms used to retrieve
the LoS velocity. SDO/HMI uses the so-called MDI-like method
for its LoS observable, whereas in SO/PHI-HRT the LoS veloc-
ity field is a result of the RTE inversion. Different algorithms
can also infer the physical quantities at slightly different heights
depending on their response functions. Such a possibility was
not considered in Schou et al. (2023), because the MDI-like al-
gorithm was used for both instruments. The use of different al-
gorithms in the SO/PHI-HRT and SDO/HMI pipelines for the
retrieval of the velocities is possibly a further reason for the dis-
agreement between the signals measured by these two instru-
ments.

The slope and offset obtained through the linear fit clearly
show a dependence over the FoV. The offset variation is partic-
ularly strong in the left to right direction in the SDO/HMI de-
tector frame system. The only physical reason for such a gradi-
ent would come from the LSC, that already had been removed,
but perhaps not entirely successfully. More advanced algorithms,
such as that presented in Schuck et al. (2016), can be used to im-
prove the LSC correction, but in this work we applied the stan-
dard procedure based on well-established models. Another pos-
sibility is an instrumental origin of such a variation, which we
investigated, but could not identify any clear cause due to instru-
mental properties of SO/PHI-HRT. Several tests using different

calibration data have been tried and no significant difference is
observed, such as improved flat fields or different prefilter mod-
els. In both instruments, several optical components along the
respective optical paths show a FoV variation that needs to be
fully and carefully characterized to remove any possible gradi-
ents in the two datasets. Also, there is no clear correlation with
any of the LSC removed from the SO/PHI-HRT data that could
cause such a signal, even if the models used for the LSC can
yet leave residuals in the data (Schuck et al. 2016). Additionally,
the amplitude of the variation is much higher than those of the
LSC. It is also worth noting that the convective blueshift signal is
highly sensitive to the spatial resolution of the instrument itself,
which means that we expect a difference between SO/PHI-HRT
and SDO/HMI, but this is not included in this work (see Ap-
pendix A). The spatial variation can be treated more easily if the
considered FoV is small and the removal of the offset and trends
can be addressed with various methods (e.g. Martinez Pillet et al.
1997; Grigor’ ev et al. 2011; Welsch et al. 2013), depending on
the goal of the study. Such a scenario is clear also in the compar-
ison of the penumbra in Fig. 6. The spread of the distribution is
substantially narrower also because of the smaller spread across
the FoV and the value of the offset is also considerably closer
to 0. On the contrary, the slope is the same as for the full FoV,
indicating the robustness of the comparison and the weaker de-
pendence over the FoV with respect to other quantities.

As a last result, the Evershed flow within the sunspot penum-
bra is compared in Fig. 7. The velocity signal displayed on an
elliptical polar grid is used to isolate the red- and blue-shifted
parts of the penumbra. The comparison between SDO/HMI and
SO/PHI-HRT, displayed in the right panel of Fig. 7, shows very
good agreement between the two instruments within the penum-
bra boundary and a small divergence in the quiet Sun. The dif-
ference measured right outside the penumbra does not change
significantly along the rotation angle axis, showing a small de-
pendence over such a small FoV. Please note that the velocities
plotted in blue have to be flipped in sign before this invariance
becomes clear. This is in agreement with the result displayed in
the bottom panel of Fig. 5, meaning that this difference is due
to the general offset between the two instruments. Stated differ-
ently, the penumbra itself shows higher velocity and smaller dif-
ference with respect to the quiet Sun, which could be due to how

MILOS and the MDI-like algorithm infer the velocity in differ-
ent physical conditions. The smaller difference in the penumbra
than in the quiet Sun can also explain the smaller spread in Fig. 6
compared to Fig. 3.

6. Conclusion

In summary, the agreement between the LoS velocity data prod-
ucts of SO/PHI-HRT and SDO/HMI has been shown using a
variety of analysis methods, providing quantitative supports for
applications that combine the data from both instrument, from
tracking of active regions to stereoscopic studies. That being
said, both instruments have calibration residuals that have to be
treated with caution. There is not one univocal method to remove
the offsets between the instruments without an actual absolute
calibration. On the other hand, the difference in the rms can be
accounted considering the dependence on the jz angle (as shown
in Obaet al. 2020). Such a procedure can be anyway only applied
once the spatial resolution of the two instruments is comparable,
as in this work, otherwise a higher spatial resolution will end ina
higher velocity contrast (Jess et al. 2023). With such precautions,
the data can also be combined pixel-by-pixel to measure 2-D
flows on the solar surface from different vantage points. The ex-
cellent agreement between the instruments, as shown by the high
correlation and by the slope consistently close to 1 as obtained
by the linear fit on the scatter plot, will then allow the exploita-
tion of the velocity datasets from SO/PHI-HRT and SDO/HMI
in multi-view configuration.

Appendix A: Large scale velocity components

The treatment of the large scale velocity components (LSC) in
the solar photosphere and their contribution to the LoS velocity
field has been extensively treated in many papers (e.g. Schuck
et al. 2016; Castellanos Duran et al. 2021). Information about
the solar coordinate system can be found in Thompson (2006).
Here, for completeness, we summarize the equations used in our
analysis. The solar differential rotation is treated according to
Hathaway & Rightmire (2011):

Vror(A) = (a+ bsin? A+ csin* A)cos a, (A.1)

where J is the solar latitude in heliographic coordinates and

a =14.437° /day,
b =- 1.48°/day,
c=-2.99°/day. (A.2)
The projection along the LoS is given by Schuck et al. (2016):
Vro(A) Atos =Vror(A)| = Cos Bo Sin d cos 6, +

(cos ¢ sin — sin Bo sind cos w) sin 4 ; (A.3)
where fos is the LoS vector in helioprojective coordinates, Bo
is the latitude of the center of the solar disk as seen by the ob-
server (solar-B angle), ¢ is the solar longitude in heliographic co-
ordinates (with 0° corresponding to the observer central merid-
ian), 6, is the helioprojective angle and y is the position angle in
heliocentric-radial coordinates.

The LoS contribution of the residual spacecraft velocity
component is:

vs/c(O, ¥) = Vw sin @ sin — Vy sin 6, cos w+ Vr cos 6p, (A.4)

where (Vp, Vw, Vy) are the radial, westward, and northward
components of the spacecraft velocity respectively. In the
SO/PHI-HRT case, most of the contribution comes from the
westward and northward velocities because the etalon can be
tuned to compensate for the radial component of the spacecraft
velocity. Hence, we also subtract a constant value equal to

Ae = Ao

ve(Ae) = Fi
0

c, (A.5)

where A, is the SO/PHI-HRT sampled wavelength corresponding
to the core of the Fe 1 line, Ap is the rest wavelength, and c is the
speed of light.

The meridional flow is also treated according to Hathaway &
Rightmire (2011):

vu(A) = (dsind + esin? A) cos A (A.6)
with
d=29.7m/s; e =-17.7m/s. (A.7)

The projection along the line of sight is equivalent to Equa-
tion A.4.

The variation from center to limb of the convective blueshift
signal is adopted from Castellanos Duran et al. (2021). Despite
the dependence of this effect on the spectral resolution (see Stief
et al. 2019; Lohner-Béttcher et al. 2019), we are not able to fit the
center to limb profile of this effect because SO/PHI-HRT is not
a full-disk imager and we do not have continuous observations
of the Sun (e.g. as in Léhner-Béttcher & Schlichenmaier 2013).

This term is then modeled by Castellanos Duran et al. (2021) as:

vps (W) =134 — 1179p — 2029p7+

+ 911243 — 10409u* + 4096p" m/s, (A.8)

where pu = cos 6, is the cosine of the helioprojective angle.
The last term is the gravitational redshift. This is a relativistic
effect depending on the mass (Mo) and radius (Ro) of the Sun
and on the distance (D) between the observer and the Sun:
GMo [1 1
c \Ro D/P

vers(D) = (A.9)
where G is the gravitational constant. The values obtained for the
two instruments are 628.8 m/s and 633.3 m/s for SO/PHI-HRT
and SDO/HMI respectively.

Fig. A.1 shows all the components for SO/PHI-HRT except
for the gravitational redshift which is constant.
