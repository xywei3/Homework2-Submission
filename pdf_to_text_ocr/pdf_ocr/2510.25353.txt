The stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) from eccentric stellar-mass binary black
holes (SBBHs) holds crucial clues to their origins. For the first time, we employ a Bayesian framework
to assess the detectability and distinguishing features of such an SGWB with spaceborne detectors,
while accounting for contamination from the Galactic foreground. Our analysis covers eccentric
SBBHs from three formation channels: isolated binary evolution, dynamical assembly in globular
clusters (GCs), and in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We find that TianQin, LISA, and Taiji can
detect the SGWBs from both isolated and GC-formed SBBHs after 4 years of operation, with

the corresponding signal-to-noise ratios of around 10, 60, and

70. However, these backgrounds

are spectrally degenerate with a strictly power-law SGWB. Furthermore, highly eccentric SBBHs
formed in AGNs yield an SGWB marked by a spectral turnover and sharp decline. While this
feature lowers the signal-to-noise ratio by approximately an order of magnitude, it can enable a
clear distinction from the strictly power-law background using LISA and Taiji.

I. INTRODUCTION

The stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background
(SGWB) originates from the superposition of numerous
GWs that cannot be individually resolved [1, 2]. These
persistent backgrounds can be broadly categorized as ei-
her astrophysical or cosmological in origin. The astro-
physical SGWB is predominantly generated by popula-
ions of coalescing compact binaries, with its spectral
characteristics encoding valuable information about their
demographic properties and evolutionary pathways [3-6].
On the other hand, the cosmological SGWB originates
rom fundamental physical processes in the early Uni-
verse, offering a precious observational window [7-9].

Two methodologies have been proposed to extract
he astrophysical information encoded in SGWBs: the
cross-correlation method [10-14] and the null-channel
method [15-18]. The cross-correlation method, widely
employed in current GW detectors, relies on the funda-
mental assumption that instrument noise between sep-
arated detectors is statistically independent. This en-
ables the separation of a common SGWB signal from
dominant noise contributions through cross-correlation
of synchronized data streams. While ground-based de-
tectors have yet to detect an SGWB in the frequency
range of tens of hertz to kilohertz [19-27], recent obser-
vations by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA) have reported
strong evidence for an SGWB in the nanohertz band [28-
31]. For future spaceborne detectors targeting the mil-
lihertz (mHz) band, including TianQin [32], Laser In-
terferometry Space Antenna (LISA) [33], and Taiji [34],
the null-channel method provides a promising detection

alternative [35-51]. This method utilizes a synthesized
null channel that is intentionally insensitive to GWs while
reserving the instrument noise characteristics. Through
autocorrelation analysis of the detection channels com-
ined with continuous noise monitoring via the null chan-
nel, the SGWB component can be effectively extracted
without requiring a separate detector. Nevertheless, the
erformance of this method is inherently limited by un-
certainties in detector noise characterization. Imper-
ect noise modeling can significantly bias the SGWB re-
construction, potentially degrading the accuracy of in-
erred background amplitudes by 1 to 2 orders of magni-
ude [47].

Among the dominant astrophysical sources, Galac-
ic double white dwarfs (DWDs) can constitute a sig-
nificant foreground [52-64], while stellar-mass binary
plack holes (SBBHs) represent another major contrib-
utor to the S@WB. Conventional models of the SBBH-
generated SGWB typically assume circular orbits when
SBBHs enter the sensitive frequency bands of GW de-
ectors [23, 60, 65-69]. This simplification can be well
justified for the isolated evolution channel, where bi-
naries descend from massive stellar remnants [70-78].
For such binaries, orbital eccentricities can be typi-
cally damped to values below 107? even at frequen-
cies as low as 0.01 Hz [79]. In contrast, this circular-
orbit assumption becomes inadequate for SBBHs formed
through dynamical processes in dense environments such
as globular clusters (GCs) [79-91] or active galactic nu-
cleuss (AGNs) [92-102]. In these environments, dynami-
cal interactions can produce SBBHs with substantial ec-
centricities, with values exceeding 0.1 persisting up to
frequencies of 10 Hz [101].

The SGWB generated by eccentric SBBHs can exhibit
a spectral shape that clearly differs from the strict power-
law spectrum generated by circular binaries [103-105].

This distinction is particularly relevant in the mHz fre-
quency band, where SBBHs remain in the early stages of
inspiral. Dynamically formed binaries in this regime are
expected to retain significant orbital eccentricity due to
their formation histories. Unlike circular binaries, which
predominantly emit gravitational radiation at twice the
orbital frequency, eccentric binaries can radiate across
multiple harmonics of the orbital frequency. This broad-
band emission structure fundamentally alters the result-
ing energy spectral density Qgw, causing it to deviate
from the characteristic f?/? power-law behavior.

In this paper, we investigate the SGWB produced by

SBBHs from three distinct formation channels: isolated
evolution, dynamical assembly in GCs, and in AGNs. To
characterize spectral distortions induced by orbital eccen-
ricity, we develop an analytical correction term that cap-
ures deviations from the strictly power-law spectrum.
We begin with a preliminary detectability assessment for
each SGWB with the TianQin, LISA, and Taiji detec-
ors through signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) calculation. We
hen employ a Bayesian framework that incorporates the
Galactic foreground, which has been shown to signifi-
cantly bias inferences of other SGWB components [52-
60, 63, 64, 106, 107]. To improve computational effi-
ciency, we derive a simplified likelihood function adapted
o the null-channel method. Using this likelihood, we (i)
perform Bayesian model selection to quantify evidence
or an eccentric-SBBH-induced SGWB against contami-
nating Galactic foreground and instrument noise, and (ii)
conduct parameter estimation to determine the precision
with which LISA and Taiji can constrain the parameters
characterizing the SGWB from eccentric SBBHs.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II presents
the theoretical framework underpinning our analysis.
Section III details the statistical methodology for S@WB
detection with spaceborne GW detectors. Section IV
presents and interprets our findings, including calcula-
tions of the eccentric-SBBH-induced SGWB, SNR calcu-
lation, Bayesian model selection, and parameter estima-
tion. Finally, we summarize our findings in Section V,
concluding with a discussion of the results and potential
extensions.

Il. THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS
A. Statistical properties of stochastic background

An SGWB arises from the superposition of numerous
unresolved GW sources. Since individual contributions
cannot be distinguished, the characterization of such a
background necessarily relies on statistical methods. In
this work, we assume a Gaussian SGWB, whose statisti-
cal properties are completely determined by its expecta-
tion value and variance.

The metric perturbations h(t, #) related to an S@WB
can be represented as a superposition of plane waves
propagating in all directions k and at different frequen-

cies f [108]:

A(t, Z) “Ble df L dQ; he(f, be? (Ref A0/ 4),
(1)

Here, Z denotes the detector position at time t, and c is
the speed of light. The polarization basis tensor e” spans
the two transverse-traceless GW polarization states P =
+, x. The Fourier amplitude hp encodes the frequency-
domain properties. Under the additional assumptions
that the SGWB is stationary, unpolarized, and isotropic,
the statistical properties of the Fourier amplitudes satisfy
the following relations:

(hp(f.k)) = 0, (2)

where (...) denotes the ensemble average. The normaliza-
tion factor 1/167 accounts for the two polarization states
and integration over the celestial sphere, while 5 and 6;;
represent the Dirac delta function and Kronecker delta,
respectively. The function S;,(f) corresponds to the one-
sided power spectral density (PSD) of the background.
To quantify the GW energy density per logarithmic
frequency interval normalized by the critical density of
the Universe, a dimensionless energy spectral density Qew
is commonly used. This parameter relates directly to the
PSD through [109]:

olf) = apes = ehh)
where Pgw represents the GW density, and po =
3H@c?/(87G) denotes the critical density, with c being
the speed of light, G being the gravitational constant
and Ho the Hubble constant.

B. Detector channel and noise

Spaceborne GW detectors will employ a triangular
constellation of three satellites optimized for mHz GW
observations. TianQin will operate in a geocentric or-
pit with arm lengths of around 1.7 x 10°km and a 3.64-
day orbital period, implementing an intermittent obser-
vation schedule of “three months on” alternating with
“three months off’ [32]. Unlike TianQin, the LISA con-
stellation will follow a heliocentric orbit, trailing Earth
y approximately 20° while maintaining a 60° inclina-
tion to the ecliptic plane, with satellite separations of
about 2.5 x 10° km [33]. In a geometrically complemen-
ary configuration, Taiji will be positioned symmetrically
opposite to LISA relative to Earth, employing longer arm
engths of 3 x 10° km [34].

The motion of spaceborne detectors introduces inher-
ent phase noise that cannot be fully canceled. To sup-
ress this noise below the level of target GW signals, time

delay interferometry (TDI) techniques have been pro-
posed [110, 111] to produce effectively equal arm length
interferometers that cancel the laser phase noise. The
triangular configuration can provide six laser links that
enable the construction of primary TDI channels, con-
ventionally designated as X, Y, and Z. Each channel is
centered on a specific satellite and synthesized from two
laser beams traversing four distinct links. For example,
denoting the three satellites as 1, 2, and 3, and repre-
senting the laser link from satellite 1 to 2 as 1 > 2, the
X channel combines two optical paths as follows:

[lLo2913331)-[lo535152>]). (5)
The Y and Z channels are constructed through cyclic
permutation of the satellite indices, maintaining identical
topological structures but centered on different satellites.

Building upon the (X, Y, Z) basis, an advanced set
of noise-orthogonal TDI channels (A, E', T) can be con-
structed through the linear combinations [112]:

A= ae x),
B= Bete
T = 1 (X4+Y42). (6)

Here, the A and E channels are primarily used for GW
detection, while the T channel serves as a null channel
mainly employed to monitor instrument noise.

channels are given by

where u = (2x fL)/c is a dimensionless parameter de-

PSDs of optical-metrology system noise and acceleration
noise, respectively. For comprehensive parameter spec-
ifications of LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, we refer readers
to Refs. [113-115]. Unless otherwise stated, this work
primarily utilizes the A/E/T channels for all subsequent
analyses.

C. Response to gravitational-waves

In the SGWB detection, the observational data com-
prise not only instrument noise but also the SGWB sig-
nal, which incorporates the detector response to GWs.

The motion of the detector can introduce time-dependent
variations in this response, while the direct processing of
data collected over multiple years from the spaceborne
detector demands prohibitively high computational re-
sources. To improve computational efficiency, the data
can be divided into shorter segments, and data folding
can be applied [106, 116, 117]. Each segment is cen-
tered at a time t and spans the interval [t —7/2,¢+7/2],
and is then analyzed using the short-time Fourier trans-
form. The segment duration must be carefully chosen:
it should be sufficiently long to resolve the relevant fre-
quency bands after time-frequency conversion, yet short
enough that the detector response remains approximately
stationary over the interval. Within such a segment of
duration 7, the frequency-domain SGWB signal is given
by the convolution of the impulse response F and the
metric perturbation h [118]:

For a single detector channel, the ORF simplifies to
a transfer function R(f), which is fundamentally deter-
mined by the configuration and arm length of the detec-
tor [119]. For spaceborne detectors, which are typically
arranged in an equilateral triangular configuration, the
arm length serves as the key distinguishing parameter.
To facilitate consistent comparisons across different de-
tectors, we adopt the dimensionless frequency parameter
u, which effectively normalizes the frequency dependence
with respect to arm length. Fig. 1 illustrates the result-
ing transfer functions for different channels. Owing to
the intrinsic symmetry of the detector configuration, the
transfer functions for the A/E channels are identical. In

location for a channel.
terms of spectral behavior, the A/E channels scale as
f?, whereas the T channel scales as f*®. This behavior
leads to a significantly lower response in the T channel
compared to the A/E channels at low frequencies. Never-
theless, as the frequency increases, the response of the T
channel rises sharply, eventually allowing it to contribute
to GW detection.

tively.

D. Sensitivity

The sensitivity of a detector channel to an SGWB can
be characterized by a sky-averaged sensitivity curve, de-
fined using the noise PSD and the ORF as [121]:

A= BGR (a1)
The associated noise energy spectral density is given by
Qn? Af
Quy (f) = Gap *Sas(D: (12)

In the weak-signal limit, the total SNR from the A, E,
and T channels of a spaceborne detector can be written
as [122, 123]

where T,, denotes the total observation time. Eq. (13)
emphasizes the significance of both the observational du-
ration and the accessible frequency band of the detector
in SGWB detection.

The energy spectral density of an SGWB often follows
a strictly power-law spectral form:

Qaw(F) = Q0(€)(F/ fret) “le=eo (14)

where Qo depends on the spectral index €, and frer is
a reference frequency. The amplitude Qo(€) required to
achieve a certain SNR threshold pip is given by:

-1/2

M0(€)lou. = Pn S Ts | ap Fl foot) *
I=A,E,T init: MH, f)
(15)
The PLIS curve is then constructed by taking the en-
velope of all such power-law spectra that yield an SNR
equal to py, [109]:

Opris(Alon = MaxlM(C)loun(f/fres)]. (16)

When visualized on a log-log scale, the PLIS curve de-
lineates the detection threshold: spectra lying above the
curve are detectable at the target SNR, while those falling
below remain undetectable. This representation offers an
intuitive and visually straightforward method for assess-
ing the detectability of candidate SGWB signals.

Ill. STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY
A. Bayesian inference

Statistical inference offers a principled framework for
identifying the presence of an SGWB in observational
data. Both frequentist and Bayesian methods are widely
employed in such analyses. In this work, we concentrate
on Bayesian inference, which is particularly well-suited
for model selection and parameter estimation.

Bayesian inference provides a rigorous probabilistic ap-
proach for quantifying uncertainties in unknown param-
eters. The process centers on constructing the posterior
probability distribution via Bayesian analysis, which up-
dates prior knowledge of the model parameters 0, en-
coded in the prior distribution p(@), using information
from the data through the likelihood function p(d|@).
The posterior distribution can be expressed as:

p(6ld) = eee (17)

where the normalization factor, known as the Bayesian
evidence, is given by:

vid) = [ a6 p(\@\v(0) (18)

Beyond parameter estimation, Bayesian inference pro-
vides a formal framework for model comparison. Suppose
we have a set of candidate hypotheses H,, each charac-
terized by a set of model parameters 9,. The posterior
probability of the model parameters under a given hy-
pothesis is expressed as:

p(9a|d, Ha) ;
| ai)

(19)
where p(d|Ha) denotes the evidence for hypothesis Ha.
The posterior probability of the hypothesis itself is given
by

P(d|Ha)P(Ha)

P(Hald) = P(d)

(20)

with P(d) representing the total evidence over all candi-
date hypotheses. To compare two competing hypotheses
H, and H,, we can compute the posterior odds ratio:

P(Hald) _ p(Ha) p(d|Ha)
P(Hs|d) — p(H») p(d|Ho)”

Oav(d)

(21)

In the absence of prior preference for either model, this
ratio reduces to the Bayes factor:

p(d|Ha)

By =.
* p(d/Hs)

(22)

The Bayes factor serves as a key metric for model selec-
ion. A value of In(Bay) > 1 indicates positive evidence
in favor of Ha, while In(B,,) > 3 and In(Bay) > 5 signify
strong and very strong support, respectively [124].
To compute the model evidence and sample from the
posterior distribution, we employ nested sampling [125],
a Monte Carlo method particularly suited for efficient
evidence estimation and parameter inference. The algo-
rithm begins by sampling a set of live points from the
prior distribution [126-129]. At each iteration, the algo-
rithm removes the point with the lowest likelihood and
replaces it with a new point drawn from the prior, under
he constraint that the new point has a higher likelihood.
The iterative process continues until a predefined con-
vergence criterion is met, with the dynamic allocation
of samples ensuring thorough exploration even in chal-
enging parameter spaces. This approach ensures pro-
gressive sampling toward higher-likelihood regions while
maintaining detailed balance. Furthermore, the process
naturally produces a set of weighted samples that can be
used for both accurate evidence computation and param-
eter estimation, enabling efficient Bayesian model com-
parison and posterior inference within a single sampling
run.

B. Simplified likelihood

In this section, we derive the specific form of the likeli-
hood used in our analysis. Instead of processing the full
multi-year data stream directly, we begin by dividing it
into N segments with equal duration T. For the n-th seg-
ment centered at time t,, the Fourier transform of the

a

time-domain signal in channel J € {A, E,T} is given by:

tn+T/2
ain= nn HITE (28)

Assuming the noise is Gaussian and uncorrelated across
frequencies, the covariance matrix of the Fourier-domain
data vector 8” = (84, 8%, 5’) is diagonal:

P(f) 0 0
C(O, f) = 0 Ps(f) 0 |, (24)
0 0 Perf)
where the total PSD for each channel is defined as
Ps (f) = Ri(f)Sn(f) + Par (Ff): (25)

The log-likelihood for the n-th segment is then given
by [38]

sh ¥ 10, NECA)
f LJ=A,E,T
+n (27 det(C)) |

= 3 [eae if) I: + In (27 P;, (f))

n [p(s (f)|8)] [sr(f)C~

For the full dataset, the joint log-likelihood is obtained
by summing over all segments:

n[£(6)] = 2 In [p(8"(F)9)]
1 Si(f)
where

(f) = oh TWD. (28)
n=1

By dividing the full dataset into N segments, the num-
ber of frequency points used in the likelihood evaluation
is effectively reduced by a factor of N, significantly en-
hancing computational efficiency in subsequent Bayesian
inference, without compromising statistical information.
Note that the above derivation relies on the assumptions
that both the noise and signal are stationary and that all
data segments share the same duration.

IV. RESULTS

A. Stochastic background from eccentric
stellar-mass binary black holes

SBBHs have been firmly observed by ground-based
GW detectors [130-133]. During their early inspiral
phase, such binaries emit GWs in the mHz frequency
band, which lies within the observational range of space-
borne detectors [134-137]. The collective emission from
a population of these binaries is expected to constitute
an SGWB.

For an ensemble of SBBHs described by population pa-
rameters A, such as component masses, spins, and orbital
eccentricity, the energy spectral density of the resulting
SGWB can be expressed as the integrated contribution
of individual sources [23, 66]:

Quw(f) = F far [ae

where Ry(z,A) is the merger rate, and oe (fs, A) de-
notes the energy spectrum emitted in the Bares frame
at frequency fs = (1+ 2)f. The Hubble parameter
H(z) can be approximated as Hov/Qm(1 + 2)? + Qa up
to Zmax = 10 [138], beyond which star formation, and
consequently the formation of astrophysical black holes,
becomes negligible.

In this work, we model the merger rate as redshift-
dependent, adopting a scaled cosmic star formation
rate density [139], normalized to a local merger rate of
Ry (0) = 1944 Gpe~? yr~! [140]. For the mHz frequency
band, only the inspiral phase of binary evolution is con-
sidered. To include the effect of eccentric orbits, the en-
ergy spectrum at the n harmonic is expressed as

Me (4 y A; oi
(30)

where the component masses are constrained to
2.5Meg < m2 < m, < 100Mo, with total mass M, =
my, +my and chirp mass M. = (mmz2)3/>/(my +me)!/®.
The coefficients A;, where vy = (1M f,)'/9, account for
post-Newtonian waveform corrections. The mass distri-
bution follows the “FullPop-4.0” model from Ref. [140],
which is modified from the “power-law + Dip + Break”
model presented in GWTC-3.0 [141]. The functions
g(n, e) and Fe) are defined in [142]. In terms of Eq. (30),

FIG. 2. Probability distribution of orbital eccentricity for
three different formation channels at an initial GW frequency
faw of 10Hz. The gold, green, and red lines correspond to
the field, GC, and AGN cases, respectively.

In this paper, we examine three eccentricity models
corresponding to different formation channels: (i) field
case: SBBHs originating from isolated binary evolution
in the Galactic field? [79]; (ii) GC case: SBBHs formed in
GCs, including A (iy AG ejected, in-cluster, and cap-
ture binaries [87]; (iii) AGN case: SBBHs residing in
AGN, treated as the fiducial model in Ref. [101]. The
eccentricity distributions for these models at an initial
GW frequency faw = 10Hz are shown in Fig. 2. For
the field and GC cases, eccentricities are generally be-
low 10~3. In contrast, the AGN case exhibits eccentrici-
ties predominantly between 10~% and 10~?, with a non-
negligible fraction exceeding. This eccentricity distribu-
tion suggests that the resulting background could deviate
noticeably from a strictly power-law form. The energy
spectral density further depends on the local merger rate
Ro, which is quoted here with its central 90% credible
interval. For clarity, Fig. 3 illustrates the energy spec-
tral densities computed using the median merger rate
of 19Gpce~* yr~!, under the assumption that all SBBHs
form through a single case. The field case yields an
SGWB that closely follows a strictly power-law form,
with an energy spectral density of Qgy © arg? x 10718
at a reference frequency of frep = 1mHz. The GC case
shows a mild deviation from this trend, while the AGN
case, which is characterized by systematically higher

sidered [91, 145-147].
orbital eccentricities, results in a strongly suppressed
SGWB below 0.1 Hz, with amplitude differences reach-
ing several orders of magnitude near 1 mHz. To quantita-
tively capture deviations from the canonical f2/3 scaling,
we model the energy spectral density using a modified
power-law form:

where fa is a characteristic drop-off frequency and 6 < 0
is a spectral tilt parameter. The correction term tends
toward unity when fg is sufficiently low or 8 > 0, thereby
recovering the strictly power-law behavior.

Assuming an operation time of 4 years, we evaluate the
expected SNR for the SGWB using the TianQin, LISA,
and Taiji detectors. The results, summarized in Table. I,
indicate that TianQin yields a significantly lower SNR
compared to both LISA and Taiji. It is further illus-
trated by the power-law integrated sensitivity (PLIS)

is crucial for distinguishing between SGWBs produced by
eccentric SBBHs and the strictly power-law background.

It is worth noting that although the observed Galactic
foreground may vary across different spaceborne GW de-
ectors due to differences in instrumental noise, LISA an
Taiji are expected to observe a nearly identical Galac-
ic foreground [61]. For simplicity and consistency in
our comparative analysis, we therefore adopt a common
Galactic foreground model in all subsequent studies anc
do not explicitly distinguish between the foreground re-
alizations of the detectors. Fig. 3 includes this Galactic

to dominate the signal below 1 mHz and remains signifi-
cant up to approximately 3 mHz.

B. Model selection

Within a Bayesian framework, the task of detecting an
SGWB can be approached through model selection. A
well-recognized challenge in this endeavor arises from the
bright Galactic foreground, which is projected to domi-
nate over the instrument noise of spaceborne GW detec-
tors. This foreground must be carefully accounted for,
as it has the potential to significantly bias the inference
of other SGWB components [52-60, 63, 64, 106, 107].
Consequently, this work extends beyond the simple con-
firmation of an SGWB presence above the detector noise.
Instead, we aim to assess the capability of the spaceborne
detector to confidently differentiate an SGWB originat-
ing from both circular and eccentric SBBH populations
against the Galactic foreground. To this end, we consider
the following three competing hypotheses:

e Ho: the signal is due solely to the Galactic fore-
ground;

e H;: the signal consists of the Galactic foreground
plus a standard power-law SGWB;

e Hz: the signal comprises the Galactic foreground
and a generalized SGWB described by a corrected
power-law model.

4 It should be noted that TianQin is planned to operate with a
half-time observational duty cycle, effectively reducing its total
data collection period to half the nominal mission duration.

The logarithmic Bayes factor In(Bjo), comparing H; to
Ho, quantifies the evidence for the presence of any SGWB
component beyond the Galactic foreground. Addition-
ally, the logarithmic Bayes factor In Bj;, comparing H2
0 Hx, allows us to assess whether the detected SGWB
exhibits spectral features that deviate significantly from
a standard power-law. We now specify the parameteriza-
ions adopted for each model. The Galactic foreground is
modeled using four parameters: two amplitudes A, and
Ag, and two spectral indices a; and ag. For the SGWB
component, since our focus lies in characterizing devia-
ions from the standard power-law form, we fix the spec-
ral index to the theoretically expected value of 2/3. The
remaining free parameters for the SGWB are therefore
he amplitude Q,5;, the drop-off frequency fy, and the
deviation index 3. In choosing priors for the parameters,
we aim to balance weakly constrained ranges with realis-
ic observational bounds to ensure a robust analysis. For
he parameters of the detector noise and Galactic fore-
ground, we adopt uniform priors on log(Sp,a), log(A1,2),
and a1.2, spanning a range of two units above and be-
ow their true values. For the parameters of SGWB, a
Gaussian prior is placed on log(Qast), corresponding to
a 90% credible interval of [-12.2,—12.0]° at a reference
requency of 1 mHz. Uniform priors over the range [—3, 0]
are adopted for both fq and £.

Following the methodology outlined in Sec. IIT, we pro-
duce 4-year simulated data realizations based on autocor-
relations of the A, E, and T channels for TianQin, LISA,
and Taiji. The dataset is segmented into 11680 intervals,

5 Tt corresponds to Qast = eit? x 10718,

each spanning 3 hours. This segmentation strategy can
reduce the number of frequency points by approximately
4 orders of magnitude, while ensuring that the minimum
frequency in the Fourier domain remains below 0.1 mHz,
thereby encompassing the most sensitive frequency band
of spaceborne GW detectors. In addition, since detector
sensitivity degrades significantly at higher frequencies,
we apply a cutoff at 0.05 Hz to reduce data volume and
enhance computational efficiency.

The resulting logarithmic Bayes factors, In(B,) and
In(Bp1), are summarized in Tables II and II, respectively.
In the Field and GC cases, TianQin, LISA, and Taiji
provide strong evidence for the detection of an SGWB,
with values of In(Bj9) significantly exceeding 5, even af-
ter accounting for the Galactic foreground. Nevertheless,
the resulting SGWBs are indistinguishable from a strict
power-law background as indicated by negative values
of In(B21), and likewise from each other. In the AGN
case, by contrast, the corresponding SGWB is poorly de-
scribed by a strict power-law model, as reflected by the
negative values of In(B10). Moreover, In(B10) exhibits
a pronounced downward trend with increasing detection
SNR. The modified power-law model can offer a better
fit in this case, with In(B21) values for LISA and Taiji
well above 5. We now proceed to parameter estimation
for this S@WB using LISA and Taiji.

C. Parameter estimation

Based on the simulated dataset used for model selec-
tion, we marginalize over the parameters characterizing
both the Galactic foreground and the S€WB component
to reconstruct the energy spectral density Qgw in a phys-
ically meaningful way.

The reconstructed Qgw with credible intervals is pre-
sented in Fig. 4. At frequencies near 1mHz, where the
Galactic foreground reaches its maximum intensity, LISA
and Taiji demonstrate comparable sensitivity. As a re-
sult, both detectors recover the foreground component
with similar precision, producing posterior estimates that
align closely with the injected values and exhibit nar-
row uncertainties. At higher frequencies, where the fore-
ground diminishes rapidly and the SGWB becomes domi-
nant, Taiji’s improved sensitivity yields more accurate es-
timates of the S@WB compared to LISA. Furthermore,
the reconstruction of the spectrum exhibits significan'
frequency-dependent variation. Below 0.1 Hz, the recon-
structed intensity deviates more noticeably from the true
values. This discrepancy can be attributed to two main
factors: contamination from the bright Galactic fore-
ground and detector noise at low frequencies, combined
with limitations of the simplified spectral model adopted
in our analysis. Implementing a more flexible param-
eterization could potentially improve reconstruction ac-
curacy in this band. For example, one can incorporate
additional spectral shape parameters beyond fa and £,
or adopt a polynomial expansion similar to those used

in Galactic foreground modeling in Refs. [59, 60]. As the
frequency increases, the Galactic foreground drops below
the SGWB while detection sensitivity remains high, en-
abling a more faithful recovery of the S@WB. Given that
1e cutoff frequency is set at 0.05 Hz, the reconstruction
for Qew is confined to assessing the spectral shape param-
eters fq and 3. To further evaluate the amplitude param-
eter Qast, we extend the reconstruction beyond 0.05 Hz.
The posterior medians are found to remain unbiased and
closely follow the injected values, confirming the robust-
ness of the Qas; estimation. For comparison, we also
show the strictly power-law background. Below 0.05 Hz,
the median reconstructed Qgw lies entirely outside the
2-0 region of the strictly power-law background. As the
frequency increases, the l-o and 2-o uncertainty regions
of the reconstructed Qgy progressively narrow and be-
come consistent with those of the strictly power-law back-
ground (though the corresponding frequency band above
1 Hz is not shown in Fig. 4).

Vv. SUMMARY

In this paper, we have investigated the detectability
of the SGWB generated by eccentric SBBHs using Tian-
Qin, LISA, and Taiji. We began by computing the energy
spectral density for three distinct SBBH populations: iso-
lated evolved binaries, those in GCs, and those in AGNs.
Subsequent evaluations of detection SNR and sensitivity
revealed that TianQin achieves significantly lower SNR.
and exhibits poorer sensitivity to the spectral feature of

SGWB compared to the other two detectors.
Furthermore, within a Bayesian framework, we first
derived a simplified likelihood function that can reduce
the number of frequency points requiring processing by 4
orders of magnitude, substantially accelerating data anal-
ysis. Using this likelihood function, we performed model
selection and parameter estimation to assess the capa-
bility of detectors to identify an eccentric-SBBH-induced
SGWB in the presence of a Galactic foreground. Our
results indicated that the SGWB from isolated SBBHs
and those in GCs are indistinguishable from the strictly
power-law background. In contrast, the SGWB from bi-
naries in AGN exhibits marked spectral deviations due
to high residual orbital eccentricity, allowing for a clear
distinction from the strictly power-law background. For
the AGN case, we further quantified the precision with
which parameters can be constrained using LISA and
Taiji. The reconstructed SGWB spectrum shows strong
frequency-dependent behavior: larger deviations occur
below 0.01 Hz, reliable extraction is achieved between
0.01 and 0.05 Hz, and the amplitude parameter Qast re-
mains consistently well-constrained at higher frequencies.

Two important limitations of our current work should
e acknowledged. First, our analysis has considered the
contributions of an SGWB from individual SBBH popu-
ations separately, whereas the observed background will
ikely comprise a superposition of multiple populations.
This integration would alter the effective eccentricity dis-
ribution of the binaries and consequently modify the
spectral transition features of the composite SGWB. For
unambiguous detection of eccentricity signatures, these

spectral transitions must occur within the sensitive fre-
quency bands of the detectors.

Second, our implementation of the null-channel
method has assumed perfect knowledge of detector noise
properties. However, as demonstrated in Muratore et al.
47], accounting for noise uncertainties can substantially
degrade measurement precision, potentially requiring the
background amplitude to be around 50 times higher to
achieve comparable detection confidence. This inherent
imitation naturally directs attention toward an alterna-
ive method. Adopting the cross-correlation method with
detector networks emerges as particularly advantageous
in this context, as it inherently circumvents the need for
precise noise property characterization [106, 150-156].

Given the anticipated operational overlap between the
