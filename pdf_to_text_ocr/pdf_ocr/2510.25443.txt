Bernstein modes — hybrid magnetoplasmon excitations arising from the coupling between cy-
clotron motion and collective oscillations in two-dimensional electron systemsoffer direct access to
non-local electrodynamics. These modes can exhibit rich nonlinear behavior akin to strong-coupling
phenomena in cavity quantum electrodynamics, but reaching nonlinear regime has remained experi-
mentally challenging. Here we report the observation of nonlinear Bernstein modes in graphene using
terahertz excitation with near-field enhancement from embedded metallic contacts. Photoresistance
spectroscopy reveals sharp resonances at B./2 and B./3 that saturate at radiation intensities nearly
an order of magnitude lower than the cyclotron resonance. We ascribe this to strong local heating of
the electron gas due to resonant excitation of high-amplitude Bernstein magnetoplasmons, associ-
ated with a combination of the field-concentration effect of the near field and plasmonic amplification
that is resonantly enhanced in the region of Bernstein gaps. Polarization-resolved measurements
further confirm the near-field origin: Bernstein resonances are insensitive to circular helicity but
strongly depend on the angle of linear polarization, in sharp contrast to the cyclotron resonance
response. Our results establish graphene as a platform for nonlinear magnetoplasmonics, open-
ing opportunities for strong-field manipulation of collective electron dynamics, out-of-equilibrium
electron transport, and solid-state analogues of cavity quantum electrodynamics.

earity is specific to the near field-generated BMs. The
near-field character of the BM resonances is additionally
evidenced by their specific responses to the circularly and
linearly polarized THz radiation, which are qualitatively
distinct from those of the CR. Our findings open a new
direction in exploring nonlinear, non-local electrodynam-
ics in 2D materials.

Il. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

The Bernstein resonances are observed in monolayer
graphene excited by continuous wave (cw) THz laser ra-
diation. The graphene sample was prepared using the
technology described in Ref. [28] and in Supplementary
Materials. The coupling of the incoming plane THz wave
to the short-wavelength Bernstein modes is mediated by
metallic contacts embedded into the sample area;[21, 22]
see Fig. 1b and Methods. Figure lc presents a typical
magnetic field (B) dependence of the low-temperature
(T) longitudinal resistance in the presence (red) and ab-
sence (gray) of the THz irradiation. The most appealing
effect of illumination is the appearance of a sharp peak

at B = 1 T, highlighted in the inset. As expected for
the principal BM at w ~ 2w, (Fig. la), the position of
this peak corresponds to half (B,/2) of the CR position,
B. = m.w/e, at this carrier density (n), see arrows in
Fig. lc. Here, the cyclotron mass, me = hi/an/vp, de-
scribes the spacing hw, = heB/m, between Landau levels
(LLs) at the Fermi energy Er in the semiclassical regime
of high Landau levels Ey >> hw,hw.,kgT, relevant for
our experiments, and vp = 10° m/s is the Fermi veloc-
ity in graphene. Apart from the BM peak, at higher
magnetic fields, the irradiation leads to the conventional
suppression of the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations
due to electron gas heating, which is maximized in the
vicinity of the CR at B ~ B,.

In the following, we focus on the photoresistance, AR,
defined as the change in Rxx under THz illumination
(blue line in Fig. lc). In the photoresistance, BM ex-
citation produces a sharp peak at B,/2, while the sup-
pression of the SdH oscillations near the CR gives rise
to magnetooscillations with the phase opposite to that
in R,, (dashed lines in Fig. lc). The CR response is
further shaped by the exponential growth of SdH os-
cillations, which obscures its purely resonant character.
The evolution of AR with the carrier density is shown

in Fig. ld. Here and below the photoresistance is mea-
sured applying double-modulation technique [29-31] and
extracted from the photosignal V as AR = VR_/ | Uin |,
where Uj, is a bias voltage (see Sec. Methods). The CR
signal is strongest at low densities, whereas the BM am-
litude shows only a weak dependence on density. The
ositions of both resonances follow the density scaling
B. x »/n expected for the linear dispersion of graphene
in the semiclassical regime. This is illustrated by dashed
ines showing the calculated positions of B./2 and Bz,
obtained using the electron density n extracted from the
eriod of the SdH oscillations.

Having introduced the typical appearance of BMs in
our experiments (see also [21, 22]), we turn to our cen-
ral observation: a striking nonlinearity of the low-T BM-
assisted photoresistance as a function of the intensity I
of the incoming THz radiation. Figure 2a presents pho-
oresistance dependence on B measured at T = 1.8 K
under 1.63 THz radiation for representative intensities
spanning almost two orders of magnitude. The individ-
ual traces are vertically shifted and rescaled to make the
evolution of the photoresponse clearly visible. The mul-
iplication factors shown to the right of the traces are
chosen such that the magnitude of the photoresponse in
he vicinity of the CR, B ~ +B, is the same. In such
a presentation the magnitude of the Bernstein peaks at
B~ +B,/2 is drastically reduced at high radiation in-
tensities. Even without further analysis, the distinct be-
haviors of the cyclotron and Bernstein resonances reveal
the high nonlinearity of the photoresponse. Indeed, the
intensity dependence of the magnitude of the Bernstein
hotoresponse, ARop/2 at B,/2 (shown by red symbols
n Fig. 2b) demonstrates nearly complete saturation. Al-
hough such nonlinear behavior could be obtained via
measurement of the intensity dependence of AR at B./2,
we performed a more detailed analysis that also traces
he changes in the shape of the Bernstein resonance with
intensity in the presence of quantum oscillations. To this
end, we have taken the three lowest-intensity traces from
Fig. 2a and found that they can be well rescaled to each
other via a proper choice of constant multiplication fac-
‘ors, see Fig. 2c. The shape of the Bernstein resonance at
he low-B tail does not change with intensity, whereas the
high-B tail is progressively stronger affected by SdH os-
cillations as intensity grows. Further increase of J makes
he relative contribution of oscillations even stronger, as
demonstrated in Fig. 2d. Note that the shape of the
ow-B tail of the resonance still remains unchanged. The
multiplication factors in Figs. 2c and 2d determine the
ositions of the red symbols in Fig. 2b. By contrast, the
hotoresponse at the CR scales almost linearly with in-
ensity, see blue symbols in Fig. 2b. Consistently, the
shape of oscillations in AR near the CR does not change
with intensity, as illustrated by three rescaled traces in
he inset of Fig. 2b.

The nonlinearities of Bernstein resonances were stud-
ied for several THz frequencies. The data for a higher fre-
quency, f =2.54 THz, are shown in Fig. 3a. Here, apart

from the principal BM resonance at B./2, the next BM at
B./3 becomes clearly detectable, see also inset of Fig. 3b.
At this frequency and within the available range of in-
tensities, the nonlinearity of both Bernstein resonances
is present but not pronounced (see Supplemental Materi-
als), while the photoresponse near the CR remains fairly
linear. In sharp contrast, at lower frequency, f =0.69
THz, the saturation of both BM and CR photoresponses
is very pronounced, see Fig. 3c. This is remarkable
given that the available intensities at f = 0.69 THz are
more than an order of magnitude smaller than those at
f = 0.69 THz, see Figs. 3c and 2b. On the other hand,
Fig. 3e shows that the magnetic-field positions of all de-
tected resonances scale linearly with the excitation fre-
quency, in agreement with expectations for the semiclas-
sical regime of our experiments. They follow the dashed
lines in Fig. 3e showing positions of Be = hw/7n/evp,
B./2, and B,/3 calculated using the electron density n
determined from the period of SdH oscillations.

We find that the observed nonlinearities at all fre-
quencies can be well fitted by a phenomenological
equation, [32-35]

Ap
AR= TEED’

where the frequency-dependent parameters A(f) and
I,(f) characterize the photoresponse in the linear regime
and the saturation intensity, respectively. The corre-
sponding fits to the experimental data are shown as solid
lines in Figs. 2b and 3b,c. Figure 3d presents the fre-
quency dependence of the extracted fitting parameters
for the principal Bernstein resonance at B = B,/2 using
a double-logarithmic scale. It reveals that the coefficient
A(f) of the linear response decreases with f (blue sym-
bols), whereas the saturation intensity I,(f) grows with
f (orange symbols). Although the results are limited to
three frequencies, it is evident that both parameters have
a strong frequency dependence. Based on these results,
the dependence appears roughly quadratic for I,(f) and
inverse quadratic for A(f), see dashed lines in Fig. 3d.
Regardless of the exact functional dependencies, which
can be sensitive to the details of near-field formation,
such as contact shape, and require more systematic stud-
ies, an important finding is that the saturation intensity
I,(f) behaves approximately as the inverse of the linear
coefficient A(f), see Discussion.

Using such analysis, we can also quantify another im-
portant aspect of our findings, namely, we can compara-
tively study the typical intensities of the incoming THz
wave causing the nonlinearity of the CR and BM pho-
toresistance. Application of Eq. (1) to the photoresponse
near the CR, see Figs. 2b and 3b,c, reveals that the sat-
uration intensity I,(f) for the CR is always substan-
tially larger than that for the BM resonance. Namely,
the solid lines in Fig. 2b (f = 1.63 THz) correspond
to I, = 3.0 W/cm? at the CR, ARor, which is 9.4
times larger than J, = 0.32 W/cm? for the BM reso-
nance, ARgr/z. For f = 0.69 THz in Fig. 3c we get

illustrated in the inset in (b); the color code here and in (c), (d) corresponds to that in (a). The resulting amplitudes ARcr at
corresponding J are shown using blue square symbols in (b). As evident from (a), the BM photoresponse near +B./2 features a
quite different evolution with intensity J. (c) and (d) show three lowest-I and three highest-I curves from (a), respectively; the
gray trace is shown in both (c) and (d). Here, the scaling factors are chosen such that the height of the BM resonance, ARcr/2,

and demonstrate almost full saturation of the BM photoresponse. Solid lines in (b) are fits using Eq. (1).

's = 0.066 W/cm? for the CR and I, = 0.028 W/cm?
for the BM resonance (ratio of 2.4). For the highest
frequency, f = 2.54 THz, the saturation intensity for
the primary BM resonance at B = B,/2 can be esti-
mated as J, = 0.65 W/cm?, similar to that for the BM
at B = B./3, I, = 1.15W/cm?, while in the region of the
CR, the photoresistance remains fairly linear over the
entire range of available I, see Fig. 3b, meaning the cor-
responding J, ~ 10 W/cm? is again substantially larger
than that for the BM resonances. These observations
provide evidence for strong near-field enhancement asso-
ciated with the resonant excitation of BMs, see Discus-
sion.

Apart from the nonlinearity of the BM photoresponse,
we have studied how it is affected by the polarization
state of the incoming THz wave. Figure 4a shows the
photoresistance for right- and left-circularly polarized ra-
diation. As expected, the CR photoresponse is well pro-
nounced for the cyclotron-active radiation helicity only
(red curve). In sharp contrast, the BM resonance has
the same magnitude and shape for both helicities. A
clearly distinct behavior of the CR and BM photosignals
is also detected for the linearly polarized incoming radia-
tion upon variation of the in-plane orientation of its elec-
tric field. Figure 4b demonstrates that the photoresponse

in the region of the CR is nearly unaffected by the ori-
entation of the incoming radiation, characterized by the
azimuth angle a, defined in the inset. In contrast, the
magnitude of the BM resonance turns out to be strongly
a-dependent. The measured dependences of the magni-
tude of AR at the peak corresponding to the principal
BM resonance at B = B,/2 are shown in Figs. dc-e for
all three THz frequencies. All these dependencies can be
well fitted by the equation

AR =a + bcos’ a, 2)

with two frequency-dependent fitting parameters a and
b. The observed distinct behavior of the CR and BM
resonances can be directly attributed to the near-field
origin of the BM resonances, see Discussion below.

III. DISCUSSION

Our observations simultaneously reveal the CR and
sharp resonances at the second and third harmonics of
the CR, attributed to the resonant near-field excitation of
short-wavelength Bernstein magnetoplasmons. Our cen-
tral finding is the observation of a strong nonlinearity of
the BM photoresponse as a function of the intensity of

he incoming THz radiation. The nonlinear regime has
not been reached in earlier works on this subject. In the
ollowing discussion we first address the common phys-
ical mechanism of resonant absorption detection in the
hotoresistance experiments, related to electron heating,
and then describe the nonlinearities, focusing on the BM-
mediated near-field enhancement that causes fast satura-
ion of the photoresistance at the BM resonances.

The electron heating, or bolometric effect, is the main
mechanism responsible for the detection of both CR and
BM resonances in photoresistance within the semiclas-
sical transport regime relevant to our experiments. In
ne case of CR, electron heating is associated with the
scattering-assisted absorption of the homogeneous THz
radiation, which is maximized at B ~ B,.[36, 37] The
uniform g = 0 component of the in-plane THz electric
field, produced by the homogeneous THz illumination of
ne sample at normal incidence, drives the uniform oscil-
atory motion of electrons throughout the sample. The
amplitude of this motion is maximized at the CR, w = w,,

tion of the uniform component of THz wave maximized
at B ~ B,. In the stationary state, the energy absorbed
into the electron subsystem is balanced by its transfer
to the lattice, governed by inelastic phonon scattering.
This balance establishes the electron temperature that is
higher than that of the lattice [38]. The elevated electron
temperature can be detected in resistance measurements,
owing to the sensitivity of electron mobility, quantum os-
cillations, etc., to the electron temperature.

The central distinction between the CR and BM reso-
nances is that excitation of the Bernstein modes is possi-
ble only in the presence of short-wavelength components
of the electromagnetic field corresponding to the avoided
crossings in the magnetoplasmon dispersion in Fig. la.
Under the conditions of our experiments, the wave-vector
mismatch between the normally incident THz radiation
and Bernstein magnetoplasmons is overcome by near
fields generated via diffraction of the plane THz wave on
the contacts that penetrate the graphene sample area.

a are strongly coupled to the electron motion in
rise to a resonant plasmon enhance-
ment in the form of coupled density and electric field
oscillations emanating from the contacts.[39] Moreover,
these oscillations become especially strong in the vicin-
ity of the BM gaps at w/w. ~ 2, 3, ...,[21] featuring
an almost flat dispersion of magnetoplasmons, and thus
corresponding to an extremely high density of excited
modes. The BM photoresponse, therefore, combines the
near-field enhancement with the usual plasmonic ampli-
fication and additional resonant amplification due to flat
dispersion in the vicinity of the BM gaps. This gives
rise to a strong BM signal despite the relatively smal
area of the sample where the BM-mediated near field is
present and, as we will discuss below, leads to bleaching
of the BM resonances emerging at very low intensities o
THz radiation. Similar to the CR, the electron scatter-
ing leads to resonant energy absorption from the excited
BMs[9, 21] and, via the energy balance in the station-
ary state, to a resonant heating of electrons that can be
detected in the photoresistance measurements. However,
unlike the CR where the heating is uniform, the BM res-
onances arise due to local electron heating in the regions
near the contacts.

We now turn to the observed nonlinear intensity de-
pendences of the photoresistance and discuss the simi-
larities and distinctions in the behavior of the CR and
BM resonances. The saturation (bleaching) of the CR
photoresponse produced by electron heating has been
studied in many works on different materials and is well
understood. [32, 33] In the semiclassical regime, it is usu-
ally caused by a rapid increase of the inelastic relaxation
rate with growing electron temperature. Effectively, this
accelerates the rate of energy transfer to the lattice at
high intensities, leading to a slower increase of the elec-
tron temperature in the nonlinear regime. This results in
saturation of the intensity dependence of the photoresis-
tance, which is frequently well described by Eq. (1), see,
e.g., Refs. [32, 33], and, for graphene, Ref. [34].

Our analysis in Figs. 2 and 3 shows that Eq. (1) also
describes well the nonlinear behavior of BM resonances
at overtones of the CR. The most remarkable finding is
hat the BM resonances, while producing a strong signal
in AR at low J, of magnitude similar to AR at the CR,
enter the nonlinear regime of strong saturation much ear-
ier than the CR. Though surprising at first glance, this
result in fact correlates well with the near-field nature
of the BM signals and their strong enhancement in the
vicinity of the BM gaps, where the spectrum of magneto-
lasmons is almost flat. Due to the BM-mediated strong
near-field enhancement, the short-wavelength THz field
component in the vicinity of the contacts has a much
higher amplitude than that of the incoming plane THz
wave. On one hand, this yields the observed strong BM
signal at low J, which is comparable in magnitude to
he CR signal collected from the entire sample, since the
strong near field of BMs leads to much stronger heating
in the vicinity of contacts (hot spots) compared to the
rest of the sample. On the other hand, stronger heat-
ing within hot spots naturally leads to saturation of the
BM response in AR at much lower intensities of incom-
ing radiation than the CR response. Therefore, the low
saturation intensities of the BM resonances compared to
CR provide strong evidence for the BM-mediated near-
field nature of the photoresponse at the overtones of the

CR.

Proceeding to a more detailed discussion of the obser-
vations, Fig. 2d shows that the shape of the BM signal in
AR changes in the saturated regime, where one observes
a progressively stronger admixture of magnetooscillations
on top of the resonant peak at B./2. At first glance, this
could be caused by the low-B tail of the CR, which con-
tinues to grow almost linearly in the saturated regime of
the BM response. On the other hand, the amplitude of
magnetooscillations at the highest intensities is abruptly
enhanced at B,/2 and remains almost constant over a
substantial region of B above B,/2. While the exact rea-
son for that is currently unclear, the origin may be that
the hot spots created by the near-field excitation of the
BM magnetoplasmons expand at high intensities due to
thermal diffusion, producing a suppression of the SdH
oscillations over a larger area of the sample. This be-

havior, apparently related to the nonlinear interplay of
spatially inhomogeneous temperature and BM field pro-
files, defines an interesting direction for future studies.

We continue with a discussion of the frequency depen-
dence of the BM response, summarized in Fig. 3d. It
shows that the linear amplitude of the BM peaks at B./2,
AR = A(f)I, decreases with increasing f, while the
saturation intensity I,(f) exhibits the opposite behav-
ior. This is not surprising because, within the saturation
mechanism leading to Eq. (1), both the low-intensity lin-
ear coefficient A(f) and the inverse saturation intensity
1/Is(f) are proportional to the low-I absorption cross-
section. On the other hand, since the linear signal A(f)I
is determined by the amount of energy absorbed via the
near-field BMs, its frequency dependence should be gov-
erned by both, the absorption cross section and the ef-
fectiveness of the BM-assisted near field generation at
che contacts, the latter being sensitive to the particu-
ar experimental configuration. Since these two origins
of the frequency dependence cannot be disentangled, the
unctional behavior of I,(f) and A(f) does not have fun-
damental significance.
Finally, we turn to a discussion of the polarization
studies of the BM photosignals. In the case of circu-
ar polarization of the incoming THz radiation, Fig. 4a,
che photoresponse in the vicinity of the CR is strongly
enhanced for the CR-active helicity (red curve), while
che BM resonance has the same magnitude and shape
or both helicities. This can be naturally attributed to
che insensitivity of the diffracted high-q near-field com-
ponents of the THz field to the helicity of incoming radia-
ion. Indeed, the BM magnetoplasmons are longitudinal
waves with a (locally) well defined direction of propaga-
ion and thus have lower symmetry compared to the uni-
form CR mode, which has no such axial asymmetry. On
he other hand, the diffraction on contacts should be sen-
sitive to the direction of the linearly-polarized radiation,
characterized by the angle a of the external THz elec-
ric field, while the CR is expected to be a-independent.
These expectations are clearly confirmed by the mea-
surements presented in Figs. 4b-e, including a strong
cos? a component, characteristic of the antenna effect,
Fig. 4c-e, which is observed in the a-dependence of AR
at B ~ B,/2 for all three frequencies. Consequently, the
polarization measurements provide clear evidence for the
near-field origin of the observed resonances at harmonics
of the CR, and therefore, support their interpretation as
a consequence of the resonant excitation of the BMs.

IV. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have observed strongly nonlinear
THz photoresponse associated with the resonant exci-
tation of Bernstein magnetoplasmons in graphene. We
attribute the observed behavior to strong local heating
of the electron gas in the vicinity of the metallic con-
tacts in graphene, governed by a combination of the
field-concentration effect of the near field and plasmonic
amplification. The near-field diffraction of the incoming
lane-wave THz radiation on these contacts overcomes
he wave-vector mismatch and enables the generation of
short-wavelength magnetoplasmons. Moreover, the flat
dispersion of the Bernstein modes provides significant en-
1ancement of the near field in the region of gaps at the
overtones of the cyclotron resonance. This BM-mediated
enhancement leads to the formation of hot spots near
he contacts and strong nonlinearities related to satura-
ion of local electron heating. As a result, the saturation
intensities for the BM resonances are much lower than
hose for the CR, governed by weaker uniform heating
of the entire electron system. Further evidence of the
near-field nature of the BM photoresponse is provided
y polarization-sensitive studies. Our findings open a
new direction for exploring nonlinear, non-local electro-
dynamics in 2D materials.

V. METHODS

The measurements performed applying
monochromatic radiation of an optically pumped
continuous wave (cw) molecular gas laser. The laser
operated at frequencies f = 0.69 THz (A = 432 pm
and hw = 2.85 meV), f = 1.63 THz (A = 184 pm
and hw = 6.74 meV) or f = 2.54 THz (A = 118 pm
and hw = 10.5 meV). The spot size of the Gaussian
eam was monitored by a pyroelectric camera [40]. The
diameter of the laser spot (1.5-3 mm) was much larger
han the size of the graphene flake, ensuring uniform
irradiation. In most of experiments, the radiation
was linearly polarized. The initial state of polarization
(a = 0, p = 0) pointed along the Hall bar, see the dashed
ine in the inset of Fig. 4b. To analyze the polarization
dependences of the photoresponse we used crystal quartz
A/2 or /4 wave plates. To vary the radiation power
we used a cross-polarizer set-up, which consists of two
wire grid polarizers. Rotation of the first one modified
he radiation power, while the second one was fixed to
ensure an unchanged output polarization [34, 41].
For photoresistance measurements, an alternating bias
voltage (Uin = 1 V) at a frequency fa. = 7.0 Hz was ap-
lied across a load resistor (Rz; = 10 MQ) and the sample,
see Fig. lb. Simultaneously, THz radiation was modu-
ated using an optical chopper operating at a frequency
of fop = 215 Hz. Such setup implements a double modu-
ation technique, see Refs. [29, 30] and Supplemental Ma-
erial in Ref. [31]. It uses two lock-in amplifiers in series
o yield a photoresistance signal, which changes its sign
upon switching the bias voltage polarity. The first lock-in
amplifier is phase-locked to the chopper frequency, isolat-
ing the photoresponse from the total signal. Its output
contains two components: (i) a constant (DC) compo-
nent, which is proportional to the photocurrent and (ii)
a component modulated at fac, which is proportional to
the photoresistance. This output serves as the input for

were

the second lock-in amplifier, which is phase-locked to fac.
It extracts the amplitude of the photoresistance signal,
yielding a voltage denoted as V. The photoresistance
is then extracted from the measured photosignal V as
AR=VR_/ | Uin |-

The sample was mounted in a temperature-regulated
Oxford Cryomag optical cryostat equipped with z-cut
crystal quartz windows, which were covered by black
polyethylene films that are almost transparent in the THz
range, but block uncontrolled illumination from ambi-
ent light. Photoresistance measurements were performed
in Faraday geometry, with a magnetic field B up to
4.0 T applied perpendicular to the graphene plane, see
Fig. A.1. Results presented in Fig. 1c were obtained in the
4-terminal geometry shown in Fig. lb, and those shown
in Figs. 1d and 2-4 in the 2-terminal geometry using the
source and drain contacts to graphene.

Optical image of the sample is presented in Fig. A.la.
The exfoliated graphene flake was sandwiched between
two hBN layers and equipped with Sit* back gate giving
access to a broad range of electron densities n. We used
Sit+ substrate as a bottom gate with 285 nm SiO» and
bottom hBN layer serving as a gate insulator. The high-
quality hBN material was fabricated following the recipe
in Ref. [28]. On top of the structure, Cr/Au contacts
were first defined by electron beam lithography and then
the reactive ion etching by SF gas was applied to the
exposed area to remove the top hBN layer. Afterwards,
0.5 nm Cr and 20 nm Au were deposited in a physical va-

por deposition chamber. Importantly, the side contac

penetrate the area of the graphene Hall bar, ensuring the
o excitation of the BM magne-

near-field effects leading
toplasmons.

FIG. A.2. (a) and (b) Photoresistance AR versus the magnetic field B, measured at T = 1.8 K for various carrier densities
using f = 2.54 THz (a) and f = 0.69 THz (b) radiation. The densities n, as provided for each trace, were extracted from
the SdH oscillations period. The arrows and dashed lines indicate the position B./2 at the corresponding densities. (c)
Positions of the maxima in AR at the B./2 BM resonance extracted from measurements at various carrier densities for all
three frequencies, as partially presented in Figs. A.le and A.2a,b (symbols). The dashed lines show the calculated position of
B,./2 at these frequencies.

FIG. B.1. (a) Photoresistance AR vs the magnetic field B in response to circularly polarized f = 2.54 THz radiation of
intensity I = 0.6 W/cm?, right-handed (RCP, gray line) and left-handed (LCP, red line). Arrows highlight the positions of the
CR (Be, highly sensitive to the helicity) and two BM resonances (B./2 and B-/3, insensitive to helicity). (b) Photoresistance
AR vs. B in response to linearly polarized f = 1.63 THz radiation of intensity J = 0.185 W/cm?. Traces of different colors
correspond to different in-plane orientation of the THz electric field in the incoming wave, marked by the azimuthal angle
a. Changes of the magnitude of the primary BM resonance at B./2, see arrow, follow cos” a behavior characteristic for the
antenna effect, as given in Fig. 4d in the main text. The carrier concentration n = 2.83 x 10'* cm~? in both panels.
