We study the role of fluctuations in particle systems modeled by Dean-Kawasaki-type equa-
tions, which describe the evolution of particle densities in systems with Brownian motion. By
comparing microscopic simulations, stochastic partial differential equations, and their deterministic
counterparts, we analyze four models of increasing complexity. Our results identify macroscopic
quantities that can be altered by the conserved multiplicative noise that typically appears in the
Dean-Kawasaki-type description. We find that this noise enhances front propagation in systems
with density-dependent diffusivity, accelerates the onset of pattern formation in particle systems
with nonlocal interactions, and reduces hysteresis in systems interacting via repulsive forces. In
some cases, it accelerates transitions or induces structures absent in deterministic models. These
findings illustrate that (conservative) fluctuations can have constructive and nontrivial effects, em-
phasizing the importance of stochastic modeling in understanding collective particle dynamics.

I. INTRODUCTION

Interacting Brownian particles are commonly used for
modelling systems accross a wide range of fields, from
opulation ecology to condensed matter. The stochastic
evolution of the particle density field in these systems,
in the overdamped limit, is given by the so-called Dean-
Kawasaki (DK) equation [1, 2], which is becoming an
important tool in fields related to dynamic density func-
ional theory and fluctuating hydrodynamics [3-6]. The
DK equation is a stochastic partial differential equation
which models the dynamics of the density fluctuations,
and which presents great challenges both analytically and
numerically. In recent years numerous studies have at-
empted to establish rigorous mathematical results and
reliable numerical algorithms [7-9], or rather to extend
he equation to account for several species o different
pes of particle mobilities, interactions or physical pro-
cesses [10-12].

One of the characteristic features of the DK equation,
and key source of its many difficulties, is the way it rep-
resents fluctuations. As it is a continuity equation ex-
pressing the conservation in the total number of particles,
the fluctuation term appears in the form of conservative
multiplicative noise. This involves the gradient of the
square root of the density multiplied by Gaussian noise.
In this paper we refer to DK-type equations (DKTE) to
the ones that include this type of noise term. Unlike
in non-conservative systems, where the noise term does
not involve a gradient operator and for which there are
well-established numerical methods [13], the conservative
fluctuating term in the DK presents many difficulties,
and the simplest approach is to neglect it (e.g. [14]), so

that the role of fluctuations is unknown. However, recent
studies [7, 15] have proposed appropriate algorithms for
the DK equation, showing [16] that they successfully re-
produce the particle dynamics and analysing its range of
validity.

In this paper, we aim to study the role of fluctuations
in a series of particle models that can be described by
DKTE. The models are presented in order of increas-
ing complexity, and we analyse relevant properties like
front propagation velocity, or the onset of pattern forma-
ion. Our analysis is performed from three perspectives:
he particle model, its corresponding DKTE description
(these two are in principle equivalent), and the determin-
istic density equation, t.e, the DKTE where the noise
erm has been neglected, hereafter referred to (some-
how improperly) as deterministic DKTE. In this way
we aim at understanding the influence of the conserved
fluctuations. We adopt for the DKTE the numerical
method from [15, 16], which, as mentioned, provide rig-
orous statements of its validity. We also aim to test these
ypes of algorithms as a function of the number of par-
icles in the system, which is why we compare with the
particle-based model.

A crucial aspect of our study lies in the choice of mod-
els, which we consider in increasing order of complexity.
This complexity arises from the manner in which parti-
cles interact. With larger model complexity, in general
we observe that the role of fluctuations becomes more
significant. We begin by analyzing a system of non-
interacting Brownian particles with a spatially dependent
diffusivity. The steady solution is studied in the presence
of a diffusivity gradient and the influence of fluctuations
analysed. Then we study again a system of Brownian
particles but now with a density-dependent diffusion co-
efficient. This can be interpreted as some kind of lo-
cal interaction among the individuals. For certain initial
conditions, the system develops sharp fronts, whose ve-
locity is examined. In contrast to other standard models
where noise tends to slow down (pulled) front propaga-

ion [17], we observe that in our case fluctuations enhance
he front velocity. The third model considers a spatially
non-local, density-dependent diffusion coefficient, so that
he non-local interaction between the particles is reflected
in the diffusivity. This system is known to exhibit spatial
attern formation [18], with particles organizing, in two
dimensions, into hexagonally ordered clusters. Again,
we analyze the model across the three frameworks (par-
icle, DKTE, and deterministic DKTE) and investigate
he role of fluctuations in the onset and stability of these
atterns. The last model we examine consists of soft-core
repulsively interacting Brownian particles, a system that
is also known to exhibit spatial patterns [14]. We study
how conservative fluctuations affect the emergence and
stability of these patterns.

The outline of the paper is the following. In Section II
we study the system of Brownian particles with a spatial
gradient in the diffusivity. In Section III we study the
density-dependent diffusivity system. Then in Section
IV we study the non-local version of this, and in Section
V the model of repulsively interacting particles. Section
VI presents a summary and conclusions of our study.

II. BROWNIAN PARTICLES WITH SPATIALLY
DEPENDENT DIFFUSIVITY: MODEL I

Let us consider a onedimensional system, with size L,
of N non-interacting particles with positions {2x;}i=1,....N
which evolve as

dx; (t)
dt

These equations are to be interpreted in the It6 sense,
with 7; Gaussian white noises with zero mean, and corre-
ions (n;(t)n;(t’)) = 6(t—t’)di;. Eq. (1) can be derived
9, 20] for the positions of a set of noninteracting Brow-
nian particles in the overdamped limit with a constant
friction coefficient y but in an inhomogeneous tempera-
are field T(x) which reflects in the position-dependent
diffusion coefficient D(x) = kgT(x)/y. Alternatively,
here we consider Eq. (1) as the simplest example within
a hierarchy of stochastic models describing the motion
of physical or biological point entities that will be used
in this paper to illustrate the impact of fluctuations on
article densities and its proper modelling.

We first derive the DKTE following closely the ap-
roach in [1]. As usual we define the single particle den-
sity pi(z,t) = 6(a;(t) — x), and consider an arbitrary
function f so that

It is standard to show, by analyzing the statistical prop-
erties of the last noise term [1], that this is equivalent to
the following DKTE for the total density:

2 :
aole.t) = 25 (Dladple,t) +2 (V2D@ ewe.)

(6)
where (¢(x,t)¢(2’,t’)) = 6(a — x')d(t —t’). This expres-
sion is better analysed in its non-dimensional form. For
this we define the non-dimensional variables = x/L,
t =tDo/L? and fp = p/po, where pp = N/L is the initial
density (which is conserved) and Do is a constant with
the dimensions of a diffusion coefficient. Omitting the
tilde notation in most of the variables we obtain:

arplest) = Fr (Deedonrt)) + Fee (2D ee)o(aele.)
(7)

where D(x) = D(x)/Do. Here it is explicitly seen that
in the limit N — oo we get a deterministic description
for the system of particles. Note that the normaliza-
tion of the scaled density appearing in (7) is such that
f dxp(x,t) = 1. Note also that Eq.(6) (or Eq.(7)) is com-
pletely equivalent to the particle dynamics described by
Eq.(1). However, our objective is to compare the particle
dynamics with the DKTE as numerically approximated,
and both to the deterministic version of the DKTE, in
order to uncover the role of fluctuations on some of the
properties of this model.

A. Numerical results

The numerical simulation of the DKTE is based on the
algorithm proposed in [7, 15, 16]. These studies demon-
strate that a standard discretization of the DK equation,
using either finite difference or finite element schemes,
rovides a suitable approximation for capturing density
fluctuations in a system of N diffusing particles, provided
hat at each time step and at every point the density ap-
earing in the noise term is replaced by the maximum
etween zero and the density computed there from the
revious step, thus preventing unphysical negative den-
sities. This numerical approximation works better in a
high density regime since one of it sources of error is pro-
ortional to exp(—Nh“), where h is the numerical spatial
grid size and d the spatial dimension. Note that, since
h here is measured in units of system size, Nh? is equal
o po times the unscaled grid volume. Thus, the small
error condition means that as long as there is substan-
ially more than one particle per grid cell (Nh* >> 1) the
numerically discretized density accurately describes the
article system. The details of the numerical integration
of this model and of the following ones can be found in
he Appendix.

For the numerical example we consider a domain (0, L}.
We impose zero-flux conditions at « = 0 and # = L. For
he spatially-dependent diffusivity we take:

D(a) =O01+2, (8)

and L = 1. The exact solution of the deterministic model
with zero-flux boundary conditions is p(x) = C/D(a),
with C a normalization constant. In Fig. 1 we present
he steady density profiles for the particle dynamics, the
DKTE for two values of N, and the deterministic DK
(i.e. N — oo). The only effect of fluctuations is the emer-
gence of a rough density profile (equivalent for DKTE and
articles) relative to the smooth deterministic solution.
This is further illustrated when we consider the average
density over realizations (p) which evolves according to
On(p(a,t)) = 2 (D(2) (p(x, t))). Thus, this equation for
he mean field is identical to the deterministic DKTE
given by N > oo. The lower panels of Fig. 1 display the
long-time average of the density (p) for the DKTE and
articles, that compare perfectly with the deterministic
DKTE description. The impact of fluctuations on the
steady density is also independent of the function D(z).

The lower panels of Fig. 1 also display the standard de-
viations obtained from the particle simulations and the
DKTE. The good agreement confirms that the numer-
ical method used for the DKTE description accurately
captures the particle dynamics.

Ill. BROWNIAN PARTICLES WITH
DENSITY-DEPENDENT DIFFUSIVITY: MODEL

In the next model, also in one spatial dimension, we
consider diffusivity to be density-dependent, that is, it
varies with the number of particles at each point in space
(we refer to this as model II). Density-dependent diffusion

statistically steady states are reached, for model I in the [0, 1]
interval (only a slightly smaller region is shown). In all panels
red circles are from the particle simulations and blue trian-
gles are from the DKTE. For the particles, densities are ob-
tained by binning the particle positions in histograms of 300
ins. Instantaneous configurations are displayed in panels (a)
and (b), whereas their averages over long times are in pan-
els (c) and (d). There, the error bars indicate the standard
deviation of the density fluctuations at each point. (a) and
(c) are for N = 1000 and (b) and (d) for N = 2000. The
lack line superimposed on all panels is the exact solution
of the deterministic DKTE, corresponding to N + oo. We
note the very good agreement between the variances of the
particle and DKTE simulations and of the average densities
etween them and with the deterministic solution. Simula-
tions of deterministic DIKE and DKTE were performed with
dt = 10°; dx .33 x 1073, up to 5 x 10° simulation steps,
while for the particles dt = 10~° with 10° steps and we binned
the particles into a density histogram with the same dz of the
DKTE.

interactions (e.g. [21]). A possible formal description at
the particle level is given by:

over all particles, the final expression for the density is
similar to the model before but now with D(p):

\+9 a atv 2D(p p)p(@)(x,t)) .
(13)
The deterministic versions of this type of equations are
generically known as nonlinear diffusion equations [22].
In the next subsection we compare, mainly numerically
and with the same algorithm specified in the previous
section, the different approximations for this model, i.e.,
the particle dinamics Eq.(11), the corresponding DKTE,
Eq.(13), including an analysis of the average (over real-
izations) density (p), and the deterministic DKTE.

A. Numerical results.

To proceed we first assume a specific form for the
diffusivity D(p) = Do(%)", where Do and n are posi-
tive constants. This type of density dependence appears
naturally in collections of individuals (like insects) that
enhance their motility due to population pressure [23].
By introducing the nondimensional variables = x/L,
t =tDo/L?, p = p/po and omitting the hat notation for
simplicity, we obtain:

where now the dimensionless diffusivity is D = p" and
the noise correlations (¢(x, t)¢(2’,t’)) = d(a—2')6(t-t’).

The nonlinear diffusion equation, represented by
the deterministic version of Eq.(14), Opa(z,t)
2 (pala, t)?*), has been extensively studied [22].
particular for n = 1 and any compact-support initial
condition, the solution approaches the parabolic form
pa(x,t) (A?e?/3 — x?)/(12t) for |x| < At!/%, and
pa(x,t) = 0 elsewhere. This represents a hump of parti-
cles limited by two sharp fronts moving in opposite di-
rections at positions a(t) = +At*/? (A is a positive con-
stant determined by normalization). We will focus our
analysis of this model in this type of sharp front solu-
tions. We perform simulations starting from an initial
condition that is already of the above analytical form
(ie. we take as initial condition py(xz,t = 107°). See the
Appendix for the details of the numerical method. The
upper panels of Fig. 2 display the solutions p(a,t) of the
DKTE, Eq. (14), at a later time (t = 0.01). The ana-
lytic solution py(x,t) from the deterministic DKTE, and
particle densities constructed from histograms of their
positions are also shown. A slight difference between the
stochastic and deterministic solutions is observed in their
temporal evolution since the front of the stochastic solu-
tion always seems to advance the deterministic one. This
is more clearly seen in the bottom plots of Fig. 2 where
we plot the same deterministic DKTE solution and the
ensemble average (p) over 300 realizations of the DKTE,
all from the same initial condition.

To better quantify these results, we compute the po-
sition of one of the sharp fronts (the right one), w(t),
as a function of time, for all the frameworks previously

discussed: the particle simulations (computing a den-
sity field via an histogram, see caption of Fig.2), the
numerical DKTE solution p(x,t), and the analytic so-

lution py(x,t) of the deterministic DKTE. We compute
the front for the ensemble average of the density over 300
realizations for DKTE and particles (the average is not
performed for the deterministic DKTE). The front posi-
tion is located as the rightmost point for which density
exceeds a threshold equal to 0.01 The results are shown
in Fig.3. The behavior of the front positions as a func-
tion of time are all well fitted with the same power law
xp(t) x t'/3, implying that the fronts in the average den-
sity of the DKTE or the particles effectively behaves as
in the deterministic case, but with a larger diffusivity (if
a diffusivity different form unity is used in Eq.(14) the
prefactor A in the front position becomes an increasing
function of this diffusivity).

An heuristic way to understand this result can be ob-
tained by taking the ensemble average of Eq.(14) (with
n = 1), which leads to (the noise disappears under aver-
aging since we use It6 Calculus):

on

Numerically, we observe (insets of Fig. (3)) a rather
accurate, which seems to not vary with time, linear re-
lationship between (p?) and (p): (p?) & D(p)?, with
D = 1.037 (for N = 1000) and D = 1.018 (for N = 2000).
Substituting into Eq. (15) we see that the dynamics of
the average density is ruled by an equation of the same
form as the deterministic DKTE but with a larger effec-
tive diffusion coefficient D > 1:

ar (p(w,t)) * D— (ol, t))”), (16)

which implies that the fronts in the average density of
she DKTE move with the same exponent t!/? as the de-
erministic ones, but with a larger prefactor arising from
he larger diffusion coefficient D, which is a consequence
of the fluctuations.
It is worth emphasizing that, in this model described
by DKTE, the velocity of the sharp front is actually en-
hanced. This contrasts with standard pulled fronts in
noisy (non-conserved) FKPP equations, where fluctua-
ions typically act to slow down the front propagation
17]. Those studies have also analysed the dependence
of the front velocity with N, showing that corrections to
he deterministic front velocity scale as 1/log?N. The
dependence on N of the sharp front dynamics for our
model is left to future work.

IV. BROWNIAN PARTICLES WITH
NONLOCAL DENSITY-DEPENDENT
DIFFUSIVITY: MODEL III

Continuing with our hierarchy of models, we now con-
sider an extension of the previous one in which the diffu-
sion coefficient depends non-locally on the density, i.e.,
D = D(pa(x,t)), where pa(x,t) = [ dyG(x — y)ply,t)
and the kernel G(x—y) quantifies the influence of density
at y on density at x. Since we focus this study on the
spatial structures that form, the system will be consid-
ered in two dimensions. The simplest case corresponds
to a top-hat kernel: G(x) = 1 if |x| < R and zero other-
wise. Under this choice pq(x,t) = Nr(x,t) becomes the
number of particles in a radius R around x at time t.

At a particle level, this non-local dependence of the
diffusion coefficient on the density is described by the
following equations for the i = 1,..., N particles:

dx;(t) _

N

(17)

7 (t) is a Gaussian white-noise vector acting on particle 4,
with zero mean and correlations (7;(t)n;(t’)) = 1d;;6(t —
t’). Again we have

~ LoeH-5 = Y

(Xx, t)

ki|x;—x.|<R j=1 k:|x;—xx|<R
= palxi,t) (18)
so that in the continuum notation, po(xi,t) =

Jixcrl<r drp(r,t), and we have D = D(pg(xi,t)). Thus,
we can write the particle equations as

dci(t) 2D(pa(xi,t)) ni(t)- (19)

dt

Proceeding similarly to the previous section we obtain
the corresponding DKTE:

Aip(x,t) = V2(D(oa)olx, +9 (/BDRCIA CH 0»

20
where now ¢(x,t) is a spatiotemporal Gaussian
white-noise vector with zero mean and correlations

(C(x, t)¢(x',t")) = T(x —x')a(t— #).

A. Numerical results

As in previous cases, we analyze the influence of fluc-
tuations in the model with spatially non-local, density-
dependent diffusivity. To proceed, we assume a spe-
cific form for the diffusivity functional and, similarly to
the previous model, we take D(pa) = Do(pa/(Lp0))?;
where Dp is a positive constant with dimensions of diffu-
sivity. The nondimensional version of the DKTE is now

dtp. t) = V*((pe)"») + TeV (V/2pah% Cle.)

(21)
[18] studied this type of dynamics both neglecting fluc-
uations, and in an equivalent particle system. In both
cases, the most relevant feature was that, in two spatial
dimensions, density shows spatially periodic patterns of
hexagonal symmetry if p is large enough. Our focus here
is to analyze, in two dimensions, this behavior in the
framework of the DKTE, and compare it with the par-
icle and the deterministic descriptions. To this end we
erform numerical simulations of the three frameworks.
Numerical details are in the Appendix.
The characterization of the emerging spatially peri-
odic patterns is carried out using the structure func-
ion, whose peaks indicate the presence of periodic struc-
ures. The structure function for the continuum system
is computed as the modulus of the Fourier transform of
he steady-state normalized density and then averaged
spherically and over time. For particles it is computed as
(1d, lek P/N), where x;(t) is the position of par-
icle i, k is a twodimensional wave vector, and the aver-
age indicates a spherical average over the wave vectors
with modulus k, a temporal average in the steady state,

and an average over many different realizations. Well-
developed spatially periodic patterns are associated with
pronounced peaks in the structure function.

In Fig. 4 we plot the height of the peak of the structure
function in terms of the parameter p for a systems of
N = 10000 and N = 20000 particles (remember this is
a 2d em at difference of the previous sections). The
transitions are observed at a critical value of p. which is
7.6 for the deterministic case, 7.3 for the particles and
6.8 for the DKTE. The value of p, for the deterministic
case can be calculated via linear stability analysis of the
homogeneous solution [18].

A salient feature of this figure is the presence of a small
region of noise-induced patterns [24], i.e., a region of p
values smaller than the one needed to produce patterns
in the deterministic case, but where fluctuations give rise
to noisy but well-developed spatial periodicity. In both
the particle simulations and the DKTE, the transition to
pattern formation occurs for values of the control param:
eter p smaller than in the deterministic case. The smal
discrepancies between DKTE and particles simulation:
are due to the numerical details in the first. Additiona
features, such as the presence of a hysteresis loop (whic
is not shown here), will be discussed in detail in the next
section in the context of a different model.

V. REPULSIVELY INTERACTING BROWNIAN
PARTICLES: MODEL IV

The last system we consider is a collection of Brownian
particles interacting through a pair potential in a two-
dimensional domain. In contrast to the previous mod-
els, where particle interactions were mediated indirectly
through the diffusivity, the current model considers a di-
rect inter-particle force. Thus, in this case the DKTE is
in fact the original DK equation [1, 2]. This system has
been extensively studied in [14] in the twodimensional
case with repulsive soft-core potentials, with the some-
how surprising result that, despite the repulsive nature
of the interactions, particles can spontaneously aggregate
forming a periodic crystal of particle clusters. The result-
ing spatial pattern is very similar to the one obtained
with the model of the previous section.

In [14] the aggregation dynamics of this system was
described with particle simulations and with the deter-
ministic DKTE, which explains them roughly. In the
present section we aim, as for the previous models, to
analyze what is the role of fluctuations in the density
description (i.e. in the DKTE).

In the above formulae, 7;(t) and ¢(x,t) have the same
meaning and correlations than in the previous section.
We use the following soft-core repulsive interacting po-
tential between particles [14] :

where r = x; — x; is the relative position, R is the in-
teraction radius, € is the strength of the potential and
a@ gives the steepness of the kernel decay. In terms of

where np = poR¢, and D= D/epoR?.

Once the parameter a is fixed so than patterns may
form (e.g. a > 2), D will be taken as the main control
parameter that, when decreasing, will bring the system
from a homogeneous to a spatially periodic configura-
tion. As in the previous model, we focus on the role of
fluctuations on this spatial-pattern transition.

A. Numerical results

From now on we fix the parameters to € = 0.0333, R =
0.1,a@ = 3, and perform numerical simulations with the
algorithm described in the Appendix. In Fig. 5 we report
the height of the maximum of the structure function un-
der the various scenarios for two different number of par-
ticles (upper plot is for N = 10000 and bottom one for
20000). The impact of fluctuations is very relevant, go-
ing farther than shifting the critical point of the pattern-
forming transition. When initializing the simulation on a
homogeneous density with small perturbations added to
it, we observe that the deterministic version of the model
(black line) exhibits an abrupt transition at D, = 0.082,
a value of the diffusivity below which large amplitude pe-
riodic hexagonal patterns are formed. This critical value
can be obtained from linear analysis of the homogeneous
solution in the deterministic framework[14]. A similar
ransition occurs for the particle simulations (red line)

and for the DKTE, but they occur at larger values of D.
Again, fluctuations anticipate the transition to patterns.
If instead of starting at a perturbed homogeneous con-
figuration, the initial condition is a developed hexagonal
pattern obtained at small D, and a numerical continu-
ation of the solution is done by increasing D and using
as initial condition the final state obtained at a slightly
ower value, the scenario changes. All the frameworks
(particles, DKTE and deterministic DKTE) show a range
of bistability, i.e., exhibits a typical hysteresis loop. The
argest hysteresis loop occurs for the deterministic case.
The hysteresis loops from particles and DKTE simula-
tions approach each other for sufficiently large N (and
also widens to approach the deterministic case for still
much larger N) whereas they shrink and become more
dissimilar for smaller N. In general, when comparing
the N = 10000 and N = 20000 plots we observe, as ex-
pected, that the influence of fluctuations decreases as the
number of particles increases, leading to a more accurate
approximation of the deterministic version.

Thus, we observe that fluctuations impact in two im-
portant ways: first, there is a shift in the bifurcation

ues of the control parameter than predicted by mean-
field/deterministic theory. Second, fluctuations shrink
the bistable regime, thus reducing the strength of the
hysteresis.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this article we have investigated how fluctuations
affect particle systems described by Dean-Kawasaki-type
equations, which model the density dynamics of Brown-
ian particle systems. We have explored a series of mod-
els, of increasing complexity, and compare their behay-
ior for three modeling frameworks: microscopic particle
simulations, DKTE, and deterministic DKTE. The mod-
els we have explored and the main impact of fluctuations
were: a) Spatially-dependent diffusivity, where diffusivity
varies with position. Here fluctuations introduce rough-

ness in the density profile but, because of the linearity
of the average equations, they do not alter the expected
average behavior. b) Locally density-dependent diffusiv-
ity: In situations in which sharp fronts form, their speed
increases due to fluctuations in contrast to other models
in the literature where (non-conserved) noise typically
slows fronts down. We have argued that this effect can
be understood in terms of an enhanced effective diffu-
sivity. c) Nonlocal density-dependent diffusivity: Fluc-
uations advance the onset of pattern formation. And
d) particles with direct repulsive soft-core interactions:
The deterministic model shows hysteresis. The stochas-
‘ic ones (particles and DKTE) also, but with a smaller
width that is further reduced as the number of particles
N decreases.

These findings demonstrate that fluctuations can have
nontrivial effects, emphasizing the importance of stochas-
cic modeling in understanding collective particle dynam-
ics. While this is a well-established message, our work
specifically confirms it in the context of conservative mul-
‘iplicative fluctuations, whose impact is often overlooked
due to the mathematical and computational challenges
chey present. Future work will consider the dependence
of the sharp front velocity on N, explore further types
of interactions between particles, and investigate alter-
native forms of mobility such as active motion and su-
perdiffusion.

Appendix A: Numerical methods

1. Models I and II

The numerical integration of the onedimensional
Eq.(7) and Eq.(14) is performed using a single step
stochastic Euler method with a finite-differences scheme.
The treatment of the multiplicative conserved noise fol-
lows [7, 15, 16], where mathematical results on the valid-
ity and accuracy of the method can be found.

We approximate the continuum function p(x, t) © Pra
where spatial positions are discretized with a spatial res-
olution h > 0, so that x = h j, and the simulation time t
is split into equal intervals of duration dt, so that t = ndt.
The discrete scheme is given by,

pitt = ph + dt f(p?) + dB(p?), (Al)
with

f(e}) = V7[Dj p7], (A2)

where V? is the discrete Laplacian, and the noise incre-

ment is,
vdt
dB(p5) = TNE [y20, P+ ai].

V is the discrete derivative. The density inside the
square root in the noise term is forced to be positive
ph, = max{0,p?}. g? is a Gaussian random number of
zero mean and unit variance, independent of the other
ones occurring at different positions 7 and times n. N is
the number of particles and D; is the discretization of the
continuum diffusion coefficient D(x) for model I (Sect.II)
and D(p'}) for model II (Sect. III). The discrete deriva-
tive and Laplacian operators are computed with second
order centered differences.

2. Models III and IV

For the non-local interaction models, models III and
IV, in two dimensions with periodic boundary conditions,
we choose to perform the discretization in the Fourier
version of the DKTE. This pseudospectral method of in-
tegration is useful for handling the non-local interactions
improving the simulation time required for each run. It
consists in performing a spatial Fourier transform of the
density field and integrate it at each time step in the
Fourier space. Products occurring in nonlinear terms are
computed in real space and then transformed back to
Fourier space. The noise term is treated as before, 7.e.,
making the density equal to 0 when it gets numerically
negative values.

We use a simple Euler algorithm to integrate a time
step (we show explicitly the computations for model IV,
i.e. for the original DK equation):

py = F[p''] is the Fourier transform of the discrete den-
sity at time step n. dAN[A%] is the non-local interaction
term, and dB[f;] is the multiplicative noise term of the
DK equation. The integration step of the non-local term

is represented in Fourier space as
dN [pr] = -ik - Fle Fak dt, (A5)

Vj is the Fourier transform of the potential, and the noise
term was integrated as

maz | 2Ddt on
dBlA;] = —ik way? [Ver a" (A6)

where g,” is a random vector with components sampled

from a Gaussian distribution of zero mean, variance one,
and independence for different sites j, times n and vector
components. We use an isotropic discretization, dx =
dy = h. The factors in the noise-term discretization arise
from the fact that for the continuous models the noise
¢(x,t) is a distribution that satisfies:

(C(x, #)¢(x', #')) = de — x’)o(t — ¢’). (A7)

Concerning the particle simulation, they are also per-
formed using an Euler algorithm, and the only require-
ment is to choose a time step dt small enough such that
dt <tc, where tc is the characteristic time for a particle
to travel a distance R (the interaction range) [25].
