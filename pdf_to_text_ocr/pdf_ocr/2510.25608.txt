The vibration of the mechanical nanowire coupled to photons via photon pressure and coupled
to charges via the capacity has been widely explored in experiments in the past decades. This
system is electrically neutral, thus its coupling to the other degrees of freedom is always challenging.
Here, we show that the vibration can slightly change the nanowire length and the associated Fermi
velocity, which leads to coupling between vibration and Luttinger liquid. We consider the transverse
and longitudinal vibrations of the nanowires, showing that the transverse vibration is much more
significant than the longitudinal vibration, which can be measured through the sizable frequency

shift.

We predict an instability of the vibration induced by this coupling when the frequency

becomes negative at a critical temperature for the transverse vibrations in nanowires with low
Fermi energy, which can be reached by tuning the chemical potential and magnetic field. The time-
dependent oscillation of the conductance, which directly measures the Luttinger parameter, can
provide evidence for this coupling. Our theory offers a new mechanism for exploring the coupling
between the vibration and the electronic excitations, which may lead to intriguing applications in
cooling and controlling the mechanical oscillators with currents.

The quantum resonator can be fabricated in experi-
ments with advanced fabrication techniques. It has been
widely pursued in a cavity optomechanics [1, 2] and me-
chanical beams [3-6], in which the parameters and the
associated vibration frequencies can vary over several
orders of magnitude (see Table I in Ref. [7]). Appli-
cations of these systems, including ultrasensitive force
sensing [8, 9], mass sensing [10, 11], subfemtometre dis-
placement sensing [12], and even charge and spin sensing
[13], have been demonstrated. In quantum metrology, it
can be used as a tool for spin squeezing, entanglement,
and even a useful platform for exploring the boundary
between quantum and classical mechanics [14]. There-
fore, the cooling of these systems down to the quantum

limit is always the central issue at the forefront of these
researches [2, 15-20]. Further, the strong nonlinearity in
these systems can lead to bistability [21, 22], synchro-
nization, and even long-range coupling between different
resonators [23, 24].

The coupling of this vibration to the other physical
degrees of freedom is essential for its application. In cav-
ity optomechanics, the vibration is coupled to the optical
pressure [25, 26]. There are also two different ways for
the coupling between vibration and electrons. The strain
induced by the deformation may lead to charge-vibration
coupling [27, 28] and spin-vibration coupling [18, 29-
33]. Via this mechanism, recently, the spin-vibration
coupling has been demonstrated in quantum dots [30—
33]. The spring constant in the resonator may also be
changed through the capacitive coupling, based on which
the single electron tunneling through the resonator can
be directly reflected from the jump of vibration frequency

[32, 34-36]. Cooling of these resonators using current is
still a great challenge in experiments [18-20, 37].

FIG. 1. Physical model and the excitations in the Luttinger
liquid. (a) and (b) correspond to the T-vibration and L-
vibration along the mechanical nanowire. The shaded black
box corresponds to the clamped ends, and y represents the
displacement amplitude. (c) Two major scattering channels
near the Fermi points, where gz and g4 are measured in units
of 2m (see Eq. 2).

In this work, we aim to explore the direct coupling be-
tween the vibration and the plasmon excitation [38, 39] in
the Luttinger liquid from the vibration-induced change of
nanowire length and the associated change of Fermi en-
ergy. This coupling induces a remarkable frequency shift
of the mechanical nanowire, which exhibits some univer-
sal scaling laws at high temperature. We also predict
the instability of the vibration induced by this coupling
at finite temperature, which can be measured in exper-
iments even at low temperature by tuning the chemical
potential and magnetic field. The possible parameters
for these predictions are also examined using the avail-
able materials. This new coupling may lead to intriguing
applications, such as cooling of the mechanical nanowires
and the control of the vibration by current and the ex-
ernal electric and magnetic fields, which may also be
generalized to other degrees of freedom, such as magnons
40-44].

We consider two typical modes termed as transverse
(T-) vibration and longitudinal (L-) vibration, as shown
in Fig. 1. The cantilever structure shares a similar fea-
‘ure with the bridge structure, which will be discussed
riefly later. The relevant interaction for the electron
gases mainly takes place at the Fermi points tkpr (Fig.
(c)). Let us introduce the subscripts L/R for the left
and right movers, respectively, then the general Hamil-
onian of the interacting spinless electron gases reads as

where p(q) = do, Chy gtk: m* is the effective electron
mass and js denotes the Fermi energy. When it is far
away from half filling, the scatterings are mainly dom-
inated by the forward scattering (denoted by g4) and
dispersion scattering (denoted by g2) as shown in Fig.
l(c). We can define the density excitations near the
Fermi points as pr(q) = Vpnokp Chey gh where op = 1
and o, = —1 for r = R, L. These operators satisfy

lpr(a), pr (a) = —Spr15q,q' Or E. Let’s define bosonic op-

2n/qLpr(—a) and d, = \/2n/qLpz(q)
for q > 0, with by = bi and di, = dit, then via a
Bogoliubov transformation we obtain [45-48]

erators as bi, =

q>0
where vp = vo [(1 + g1)? — 93] can with g2,g3 < 1 for

weak interaction. Thus vp is the Fermi velocity without
scattering. This mapping from boson and fermion parti-
cles is exact; thus, the interacting electron system can be
described with a bosonic model [47, 49, 50]. This linear
dispersion will not be affected by the disordered poten-
tial [51, 52]. Hereafter, these collective excitations will
be termed as phonons [38, 39, 53-56].

The vibration can slightly change the length of the
nanowire, while the total number of particles is fixed,
thus vp should be length dependent. To determine the
influence of this effect, we model the mechanical nanowire
using the Euler-Bernoulli equation [64, 65]

EIO#Y (w,t) = —pAd?Y (x,t), (3)

in which the frequencies for the T-vibration in Fig.

FIG. 2. Energy scales of the vibration, plasmons, and tem-
perature. The typical materials are set in the same size
(3 um, 10nm, 15 nm) (notice that in nanotube, diameter d = 4
nm is used). The plasmon frequencies are denoted by we.
Here we set vp = 10° m/s, thus w. © 16 GHz. This energy
mismatch can not be decreased by increasing the system sizes.

Bm & (2m + 1)r/2, I = Aw?/12 is the geometric mo-
ment of inertia, A = wd is the area of the cross sec-
tion (w is the thickness and d is the width), p is the
mass density, E is the Young’s module and L is the
static nanowire length. Note that the cantilever has sim-
ilar frequencies, except some slightly different coefficients
Bm, thus our prediction is also directly applicable to the
physics of cantilevers [66]. For the L-vibration in Fig.
1(b), 2%) = \/E/pL?. These parameters in several typ-
ical systems in experiments are summarized in Table I.
Usually, A) /Q%) = 62,w/(V12L) K 1 when L > w,
since bending needs much less energy than stretching for
a rigid nanowire.

With the solution from Eq. 3, by assuming that the
fluctuation magnitude is much smaller than the total
nanowire length, we have

LY =Ltamy?/L, L® =L+y, (4)

where a, ~ m?n?/4 for vibration y along the transverse
direction (see inset of Fig. 1(a)) and along the longitu-
dinal direction (see inset of Fig. 1(b)). Let us introduce
Y = Yer(at at) and p = —imegQyzp(a — at), where a
and al are bosonic operators, and yz» = 1/V2mepQ. is
the zero point displacement with effective mass effective
Meg = pLA/3. The Hamiltonian of these two models
can be written as Hp = p?/2meg + 1/2mepM?y?. There-
fore, we arrive at the total Hamiltonian for the coupling
between the nanowire and the electrons as

H=Hg+H.(L+y). (5)

Eq. 5 is one of the major formulas we have derived
in this work. Noticed that the change in length can
slightly change the Fermi energy, which can influence
Hp. This interaction, in most cases, is very weak; how-
ever, the number of plasmons is huge in the regime when
Q,hvpqg < kpT, where kg is the Boltzmann constant
(see Fig. 3), which can lead to considerable influence on
the vibration frequency. For small y, we have

H. = ho vega bibg + dda) , (6)

q>0

where A = 1 — amy?/L? for T-vibration and A = 1 —
y/L+y?/L? for L-vibration. Since y « a+at, we see that
these two different vibrations have totally different con-
sequences for the nanowire. In general, ypa/L > g(a.)
(see Fig. 3), and this energy mismatch can not be de-
creased by increasing the system sizes. Thus, the reso-
nance between the phonon mode and the vibration mode,
analogous to the parametric excitation of the pipeline
by its conveying pulsating fluid, which can be observed
in everyday life, is assumed not to be allowed in this
manuscript. The possible resonance between them, via
vpn /L = Q, is estimated in Ref. [67] and their related
strong coupling will be discussed elsewhere.

We mainly focus on the frequency shift at finite tem-
perature induced by this coupling, which is observable
in experiments. Typically, the coherent dynamics in the
nanowire can persist with a typical time scale of the order
of MHz, which can be much slower than the electronic
relaxation time in the nanowire. In metals and semi-
conductors, the relaxation time near the Fermi surface
can be of the order of picoseconds and sub-picoseconds
[68, 69] as estimated from the free path length divided
by vp. For this reason, the interacting electrons can
be treated as a background field in thermal equilibrium.
From the partition function Z. = Tre~° BF we
can obtain the effective Hamiltonian for the nanowire as
Hog = Hp + F = p?/2mer + Veg, where

Here 7 = we/wr is the ratio between the plasmon fre-
quency w. = vp7/L and the temperature frequency
wr = kgT/h. Notice that here we can not directly set
bh bg and didg to the mean number of plasmons because

not only the mean energy but also the entropy can con-
tribute to Vig. At high temperatures, the entropy from
F =U —TS is as important as the Hamiltonian energy
U = H (see Fig. 3(d)).

The effective potential can qualitatively change the vi-
bration frequency of the mechanical nanowire, provid-
ing a direct experimental signature for the coupling be-
tween the vibration and a Luttinger liquid. For 7 > 1,
e' <1, then by keeping only the leading term (J = 1)
and for the two vibrations in Fig. 1(a) and (b), we have

At high temperature, 7 < 1 and e~ ~ 1, it is com-

We see that in these two limits, the coupling between
the vibration and the Luttinger liquid gives rise to a new
quadratic term, while the linear term is not important for
the determination of modified frequency. Let us assume
the new frequency as 9’, then we can define the frequency
shift as dw(%) = Q(%) — (Q/)(@), We are particularly
interested in the condition when dw is much smaller than
Q. At low temperatures, we have

At low temperature, dw x exp(—Svpm/L), thus the fre-
quency shift is negligible. The increase in temperature
can quickly increase the number of phonons, making the
coupling more and more significant. At high temperature
we find dw « T", with « = 2 for T-vibration and k = 1
for L-vibration. Especially, we find Jus is independent
of nanowire length while Juss) decreases with increasing
of L. These scaling laws can also be derived from the
dimension analysis by assuming them to be a product
of pA, L, EI, vg, kgT, h and total mass, which reflects
the linear dispersion of the phonons, thus it is a general
feature of the Luttinger liquids.

FIG. 3. Frequency shifts in nanowires with various materials.
In (a) and (c), the solid lines are numerical results based on
Eq. 7, and the dashed lines are our approximated frequency
shifts using Eqs. 10 - 13 for nanowires with the same sizes (100
ym, 10 nm, 15 nm). In this condition, yzp is estimated to be
of the order of 107? m. In InAs, m* = 0.023me and 0.41me
for electron and hole, respectively, with ne = 10° /em® [70].
The Fermi velocity vp for InAs (electron), InAs (hole) and
SiOz (hole) are 7.9 x 10*, 4.4 x 103, and 3.1 x 10° m/s, re-
spectively; while in graphene, nanotube and Al, are 8 x 10°,
8 x 10°, 1.0 x 10° m/s. (c) Number of plasmons in the lowest
mode. (d) T'S/U, where S is the entropy and U is the Hamil-
tonian energy, as a function of T. When T is high enough,
this ratio will approach the upper bound 2 due to the linear
nature of the collective excitations.

With this theory, we present the frequency shifts in
several typical materials in Fig. 3 using metals and nan-
otubes with vp ~ 10° m/s and semiconductors with tun-
able electron and hole concentration with vp from 10° to
0° m/s. In the normal metals, we have used concentra-
ion ne = 10?? /em? and m* = me (rest electron mass);
and for the semiconductor nanowires, ne ~ 10! — 1018
/cm? [70]. In general, the effective mass of hole is much
heavier than the electron, thus has a much smaller vp.
We see that at low temperature, the frequency shifts are
generally small, thus are unquantifiable. The scaling
aws of the frequency shifts at high temperature when
wr >> we can be measured in experiments. This sim-
ulation shows clearly that the larger vp is, the smaller
requency shift the system will be. Thus, in experiments,

hese kinds of shifts can be more easily measured in semi-
conductor nanowires with a heavier effective mass. We

also found that the T-vibration has a much stronger fre-
quency shift as compared with the L-vibration.

A striking prediction in this coupling is the instabil-
ity of the suspended bridge when the frequency becomes

negative at
_ 6 [Bhvp ET
kel 20mm”

It means, the longer the chain is, the smaller the tem-
perature will be for this kind of instability. As naively
expected, a nanowire with a larger Young’s modulus and
larger cross-section is expected to have a larger critical
temperature. For the typical parameters in Fig. 3(a),
one can find T, is of the order of tens of Kelvin to hun-
dreds of Kelvin [71]. This instability is more likely to
be realized in samples with small vp, long length L, and
small Young’s modulus. In realistic experiments, it is ex-
pected to happen at T < Ty, since the variance of the
frequency shift can be calculated as

(14)

o(du)) = 3du>) , (15)

where, again, the prefactor 3 is exact only for linear dis-
persion. Thus, during the frequency shift, significant
broadening of the spectra is also accompanied, which also
scales as T". Thus, when the temperature is high enough,
which is still smaller than T., we expect the instability of
the nanowire about the zero point. In this analysis, we
ignore the effect of gravitational force for the reason that
it is a linear function of displacement y, which will not
directly influence the instability of the nanowire. This
instability can be useful for exploring the nonlinearity
induced bistability [22-24].

This analysis also implies that the frequency shift
can be measured and controlled by the current through
the nanowire. Due to the fast carrier relaxation in
the nanowire, we can treat the vibration as an adi-
abatic process for the calculation of current and the

related conductance. Let us consider the T-vibration
by adding a small bias over the two ends, thus
the conductance is G = Ke?/h [47|, where K =
Qnvpr/(1 + G4 — G2)/A + g4 + G2) is the Luttinger pa-
rameter. This conductance may exhibit time-dependent
oscillation with period given by the vibration frequency,
which is more easily distinguished in the nonlinear regime
with strong vibration [30]. This method has been used in
experiments to reveal the spin-vibration coupling [30, 31].

Finally, we discuss the tunability of the coupling be-
tween vibration and the Luttinger liquid. From the fre-
quency shift, we see that the only tunable parameter for a
given sample is the Fermi velocity vp, while all the other
parameters are fundamental properties of the nanowire,
thus can not be tuned. To solve this dilemma, let us gen-
eralize the spinless model to the spinful one by consider-
ing the physics in the InAs nanowire. The Hamiltonian
can be written as H = h?k?/(2m*) + B.o, + ako, [45],
where a is the spin-orbit coupling strength, and B, is the
Zeeman splitting by the magnetic field. The single parti-
cle spectra and the corresponding vp are shown in Fig. 4.
The gap width between the two bands can be controlled
by the magnetic field. We find a significant change of vp
from the order of 10° m/s to vp ~ 0 when js approaches
some van Hove points. In this regime the concentration
density n, ~ 10'8/cm. This tunability has been used
in experiments for the searching of Majorana zero modes
with fine tuning of chemical potential [72-75], thus our
predicted instability can be observed in experiments by
tuning the chemical potential and magnetic field with
fixed temperature.

To conclude, we present a new mechanism for cou-
pling between the vibration and the collective excita-
tion of interacting electrons in the mechanical nanowire.
This work can lead to numerous ramifications. For ex-
ample, this theory can yield new frontiers for exploring
intriguing couplings between vibration and electronic ex-
citations, as well as their cooling and control by current
and external fields. It also opens the avenue for explor-
ing the coupling between vibration and interacting Fermi
liquids, magnons [40-44], and even with some phase tran-
sitions [47], which certainly can greatly enrich the family
of mechanical vibration physics [1, 2].

in nanomechanical cantilevers, Phys. Rev. B 87, 024304
(2013).

The eigenfrequencies of the cantilever structure can be

also written as Qm = B?,/EI/(pA)/L”, where the co-

effients Bm are 1.8751, 4.6941, 7.8548, ---. For m > 3,
we can have an approximation expression as Bm = (2m—
1)7/2.

The resonant between the phonon modes and vibration
mode may be allowed in some particular designed struc-
tures. For example, consider a nanowire with vp = 10*
m/s and L = 100 um, we have frequency vet /L = 3x 10°
Hz, which is comparable with the C nanotube frequency
summarized in Table I in Ref. [7]. This may lead to
some other interesting phenomenon not considered in this
work.

we have 0 = 0.19 MHz. When vp = 4.4 x 10? m/s, the
