ABSTRACT

A recent asteroseismic analysis suggests that Kepler-56 — a planet-hosting red giant — exhibits a unique spin structure: (1) the
spin axes of the core and envelope are misaligned; and (2) the envelope rotates approximately an order of magnitude faster than
typical red giants. In this paper, we investigate a feasible scenario to reproduce this spin structure by estimating the amount of the
angular momentum (AM) supply from the planets through the simplified calculation of the time evolution of AM. As a result,
unless the tidal efficiency is extremely high, we show that the tidal interactions between the known close-in planets (Kepler-56
b and c) are insufficient to supply the AM required to accelerate Kepler-56 from the spin rate observed in typical red giants. We
also show that the engulfment of a hot Jupiter can be expected to provide sufficient AM supply for the acceleration ant that the
mass and orbit of the engulfed hot Jupiter are constrained by a mass of 0.5-2 Jupiter masses and an orbital period of 1-6 days. On
the other hand, if Kepler 56 was already rapidly spinning before entering the RG stage and requires no acceleration, the obliquity
damping by the known close-in planets can reproduce the spin structure of Kepler-56. Even in such cases, planetary engulfment
during the MS stage might be involved in achieving rapid spin before the tidal alignment. These discussions demonstrate the
importance of Kepler-56 as a candidate for planetary engulfment that may leave traces of its spin structure.

1 INTRODUCTION

Stellar spin is one of the cornerstones of understanding stellar physics.
It plays a crucial role in governing magnetism through the dynamo
mechanism and influences chemical mixing in the stellar interior
(e.g. Maeder & Meynet 2000). Therefore, the evolution of angular
momentum (AM) in a star has been actively discussed, and several
theories have been proposed as mechanisms governing the evolution

For understanding stellar AM evolution, red giant (RG) stars pro-
vide important insights because asteroseismic analysis yields great
constraints on their spin profile (e.g. Aerts et al. 2019). The ra-
diative core and convective envelope in RG behave as g-mode and
p-mode cavities, respectively. The rotational splitting of gravito-

(e.g. Maeder 2009): AM loss due to stellar wind, magnetic instability,
meridional circulation, and internal waves.

In addition to these processes, AM exchange with a companion can
play a significant role. It is known that orbital AM of the companion
can be exchanged with spin AM through tidal or magnetic interac-
tions (Zahn 1975, 1977; Hut 1981; Benbakoura et al. 2019; Ahuir
et al. 2021), mass transfer (Packet 1981; Dervisoglu et al. 2010),
merger/engulfment (de Mink et al. 2013; Privitera et al. 2016a,c; Lau
et al. 2025). Generally, these interactions accelerate the stellar spin
rate and decrease the inclination between the stellar spin and orbit.
In this respect, they are considered to be the origin of observational
properties of stellar spin that cannot be explained by the single-star
evolution, such as a fast-spinning star (Shao & Li 2014; Maxted
et al. 2015; Tejada Arevalo et al. 2021) or the spin-orbit alignment

acoustic mixed mode enables estimation of the spin periods of both
the core and envelope (Beck et al. 2012; Mosser et al. 2012; De-
heuvels et al. 2014). Moreover, the amplitudes of the split modes
give a constraint on the inclination angle of the spin axis. In fact, the
long-baseline and high-precision photometry obtained by the Kepler
mission (Borucki et al. 2010) provided spin profiles for well over
a thousand red giants (Gehan et al. 2018; Li et al. 2024; Dhanpal
et al. 2025), enabling more detailed verification of the stellar AM
evolution (Fuller et al. 2019; Eggenberger et al. 2019; Takahashi &
Langer 2021).

Among them, this paper focuses on the RG star Kepler-56 (KIC
6448890, KOI-1241), which hosts multiple exoplanets and exhibits
an unusual spin profile. The transit and radial-velocity methods re-
vealed that Kepler-56 possesses two close-in planets, Kepler-56 b and
Kepler-56 c (Steffen et al. 2013; Huber et al. 2013; Weiss et al. 2024).

In addition, asteroseismic analysis revealed that the inclination angle
of the spin axis relative to the line of sight (hereafter, spin inclination
angle) is about 40 degrees in Kepler-56 (Huber et al. 2013). As the
2  T.Tokuno

transiting planetary orbits are almost edge-on, this spin inclination
implies the spin-orbit misalignment of the Kepler-56 system, which
attracts attention to Kepler-56 (Li et al. 2014; Fellay et al. 2021).

In recent years, the uniqueness of Kepler-56 has been further high-
lighted by the up-to-date analysis of Ong (2025). They constructed
an asteroseismic prescription for cases where the spin inclination
angle of the core and envelope are independent, while the previous
analyses have assumed that they are aligned. Their reanalysis of os-
cillation data for Kepler-56 found Kepler-56’s spin profile different
from the previous results (Huber et al. 2013; Fellay et al. 2021). Most
notably, the spin inclination angle of the envelope is markedly mis-
aligned with that of the core, which is the first evidence of internal
spin misalignment. Furthermore, it is suggested that Kepler-56 has a
spin rate several times faster than other RGs with similar mass

These characteristics of Kepler-56’s spin, internal spin misalign-
ment and the rapid envelope spin rate, are difficult to reproduce under
the single-star evolution (see also the discussions of Ong 2025). Thus,
it is considered that Kepler-56 is a suitable object for investigating
the impact of AM transfer with its companion on the stellar spin.
However, the discussion regarding the formation process is still in
progress.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the formation scenario of
Kepler-56’s spin profile, assuming it to be a by-product of interaction
with the planet. Through the observational constraints and estimation
of the AM supply, we investigate a formation scenario for Kepler-
56’s unusual spin profile. Our discussion is expected to contribute
to elucidating the formation process of not only Kepler-56 but also
other RGs with the rapid spin or internal spin misalignment, both
known and yet to be discovered.

The rest of the paper is organised as follows: First, we introduce our
scenarios and method in Section 2; Next, we provide the feasibility
of the scenarios in Section 3. Finally, we provide the discussion and
summary in Sections 4 and 5.

2 METHOD

In this section, we first present a brief summary of the properties of
the Kepler-56 system (Section 2.1). Next, we introduce two scenarios
to reproduce the spin profiles of Kepler-56 (Section 2.2). Finally, we
explain the process to investigate the feasibility of two scenarios
(Section 2.3).

2.1 Properties of the Kepler-56 system

In Table 1, we summarise the symbols used in this paper and the ob-
served values in the Kepler-56 system. This table and the discussion
below are based on Huber et al. (2013), Weiss et al. (2024) and Ong
(2025).

2.1.1 Stellar properties

First, we introduce the stellar properties of Kepler-56. The joint
analysis of asteroseismic and spectroscopic observations indicates
that Kepler-56 is the star at the base of the RG branch (Teg = 4840 +
97 K and log g = 3.31 + 0.01). Also, the estimated mass and radius
are 1.32 + 0.13 Mo and 4.23 + 0.15 Ro, respectively, indicating that
Kepler-56 is an RGs originating from an F-type main-sequence (MS)
star. Also, it is revealed that Kepler-56 is metal-rich, with [Fe/H]
= +0.20 + 0.16.

The most remarkable feature of Kepler-56 is its unique spin profile.
An asteroseismic analysis by Ong (2025) uncovered the structured

et al. 2024) with 1.20-1.45 Mo. The abscissae in both panels are the stellar
radius. Kepler-56 is marked in the star-shaped symbol, while other RGs are
marked in the circle symbols.

spin profile of Kepler-56: the core spin with a period of Peore =
21.3 + 0.2d and an inclination angle of icore = 43 + 2deg; the
envelope with a period of Peny = 723 days and ieny = 104 + 4deg.
These spin inclination angles indicate that the true obliquity of the
spin axis between the core and envelope is at least 60 degrees or
more, considering the effect of projection in the direction of sight.
Furthermore, compared to RGs of similar mass, the envelope spin
of Kepler-56 is noticeably rapid. Fig. 1 shows the comparison of Peny
and Peore between Kepler-56 and other RGs with similar masses,
which are 1.20-1.45 Mo (Liet al. 2024). It is found that, while Peore
of Kepler-56 remains within the typical range observed for RGs, Peny
of Kepler-56 is several times more rapid than those of other RGs.

The surface spin rate of Kepler-56 measured by other methods is
consistent with the asteroseismology-based spin period in the enve-
lope, Peny ~ 70d. One is based on the Lomb-Scargle analysis for
the spot-induced quasi-periodic variations in the light curves, sug-
gesting a surface spin rate of 74 + 3d (Huber et al. 2013)!. The
other is measurements of spectral broadening from spectroscopic
analysis, which support v sini = 2-3 km- s7! (Petigura et al. 2017;
Rainer et al. 2023), where v sini is a rotational velocity. This is
in agreement with the estimated value from asteroseismic results,
vsini =2.8+0.3km-s7!.

Since the two methods above and the asteroseismic method present
the spin rate at the surface and the kernel-weighted envelope spin
rate, respectively, the consistency shown above supports uniform
spin within the envelope (Ong 2025). It enables us to calculate the
total AM of Kepler-56 (Section 2.3.1).

2.1.2 Planetary properties

Second, we introduce the properties of planets around Kepler-56.
Orbiting Kepler-56 are two close-in gaseous planets, Kepler-56 b
and Kepler-56 c, both of which transit the stellar disc. The radial
velocity observations 2 reveal that an inner planet, Kepler-56 b, is a
Neptune-sized planet (Mpi,b = 0.11 +0.04 Mj) with an orbital period
of Porp,b = 10.5 d, while an outer planet, Kepler-56 c, is a sub-Jovian
planet (Mpi,c = 0.74 + 0.03 Mj) with Porp,¢ = 21.4d.

Both planets reside in nearly circular and coplanar orbits. Since
they have transiting orbits, their orbital inclination angles are per-
pendicular to the line of sight. It suggests that, at least in terms of
projected inclination, their orbital axes tend to align with the spin
axis in the envelope. Conversely, for core spin, there is spin-orbit
misalignment by at least 50 deg.

We note that the radial-velocity observations show the presence
of a distant outer planet, Kepler-56 d, and another planet further
outside (Otor et al. 2016; Weiss et al. 2024). It is suggested that the
torque caused by these distant planets can affect the orbital planes
of Kepler-56 b and c (Huber et al. 2013; Li et al. 2014). In our
calculations, which focus only on the post—-main-sequence (post-
MS) stage, this effect is considered negligible. However, its possible
impact is discussed in Section 4.1, which discusses the long-term
evolution including the MS stage.

2.2 Our formation scenarios

We consider the initial condition that the original spin axes of the
core and the envelope are aligned but misaligned with the planetary
orbit. When the stellar spin is faster than the planetary revolution,
the tidal interactions transports the planet’s orbital AM to the stellar
spin. This causes the stellar spin to accelerate, the orbital radius to
decrease, and the spin-orbit obliquity to decrease, simultaneously.

' Since the spin rate from the spot modulation is more accurate, this paper
adopts it as the envelope spin rate (see Table 1)

2 To be precise, Weiss et al. (2024) indicate the minimum mass, but consid-
ering the orbital inclination suggested by the transit (Huber et al. 2013), we
use it as the mass.

Engulfment of a hot Jupiter into Kepler-56 3

Given that this effect works on the envelope, this process may re-
produce the spin structure of Kepler-56. To clarify, in this study we
consider tidal processes working in the convective envelope, namely
the equilibrium tide (Zahn 1989; Mathis et al. 2016) and the dissi-
pation of the inertial waves (Ogilvie & Lin 2007; Lai 2012; Ogilvie
2013) or f-modes (Vick & Lai 2020). By contrast, we do not con-
sider the dissipation of g-modes (Barker & Ogilvie 2010; Essick &
Weinberg 2016; Ma & Fuller 2021; Weinberg et al. 2024), as it is
expected primarily to transfer AM to the radiative core. This is sup-
ported by the fact that the spin rate of Kepler-56’s core is comparable
to other RGs despite the its small moment of inertia (Section 2.1.1).

On the basis of this, we consider that two scenarios can explain
the current state of the Kepler-56 system (see Fig. 2 for a schematic
picture). The first one is that the required AM is supplied by tidal
interactions with the known planets Kepler-56 b and c (Winn et al.
2010; Meynet et al. 2017; Saunders et al. 2024a). This scenario can
reproduce the current property where the envelope is more closely
aligned with the orbits of Kepler-56 b and c than with the core.

The second one is the AM supply through the engulfment of a
hot Jupiter (HJ) that originally existed (Carlberg et al. 2013; Tayar
et al. 2022; O’Connor et al. 2023; Lau et al. 2025, see Section 4.2
for the possibility of heavier companions). Assuming that the orbit
of engulfed HJ is coplanar with Kepler-56 b and c but misaligned
with the original spin-axis, AM supply through the engulfment can
reproduce the spin structure of Kepler-56. Also, it is considered that
the engulfed HJ was originally located inside Kepler-56 b in terms
of dynamical stability.

In either scenario, the AM supply is considered to occur during
the post-MS stage rather than the MS stage. It is supported by the
following considerations (see also the discussion of Ong 2025). It is
generally known that the difference in spin rates between the core and
envelope is small during the MS star (Kurtz et al. 2014; Saio et al.
2015; Benomar et al. 2015; Van Reeth et al. 2018; Saio et al. 2021).
Then, if there is massive AM supply to the envelope, the envelope
rotates faster than the core, causing realignment of the spin axis due
to internal AM transport from the envelope to the core. On the other
hand, in the post-MS stage, the difference in spin rates between the
core and envelope is large, and the moment of inertia of the envelope
is also large. In such cases, the envelope spins slower than the core
even after the massive AM supply, as in Kepler-56. This profile makes
it easier to maintain internal spin misalignment because the direction
of internal AM transport is from the core to the envelope.

Furthermore, the picture of AM supply occurring in the post-MS
stage is consistent with the trend of the efficiency of tidal torque. The
tidal torque is proportional to the fifth power of the stellar radius, and
therefore becomes extremely strong in the post-MS stage (see Section
2.3). Also, compared to F-type MS star with very thin or no surface
convective layers, post-MS stars with thick surface convective layers
exhibit strong tidal torques (Winn et al. 2010; Lai 2012; Rogers &
Lin 2013; Saunders et al. 2024a).

2.3 Process for investigating feasibility

We introduce the process for investigating the feasibility of the two
scenarios discussed in Section 2.2 from the perspective of whether
AM required to reproduce Kepler-56 can be supplied.

2.3.1 Estimation of needed AM supply

We discuss how much AM is needed to reproduce Kepler-56 under
the scenario shown in Fig. 2.

Figure 2. Schematic picture of our scenario to reproduce the spin profile of Kepler-56. Initially, the spin axes of the core and envelope were aligned in a direction
offset from the orbit. After AM supply from the planetary orbit to the stellar envelope, the envelope spins more rapidly in a direction offset from the core. This
AM supply is considered to occur during the post-MS stage (refer to the main text for details).

Here, we denote the spin AM vector observed in Kepler-56 as Jobs
and the AM vector in the initial condition as Jini. In this case, the
AM vector required to reproduce Kepler-56 is Jops — Jinit- This AM
vector can be separated into the expansion (i.e., spin acceleration)
and rotation (i.e., obliquity damping) of the spin AM vector, which
are represented as Lace and Ldamp hereafter. The norms of Lace can
be written as

Lace = Joos ~ Jinit = obs, qd)

where we introduce the notation x = |x| for any vector x. Also, @
introduced here is the coefficient when Lace is normalised by Jops. On
the other hand, the norm of Ldamp depends on how obliquity damping
works and satisfies 2 sin(w/2)Jinit < Laamp S$ 2 sin(W/2)Jobs, where
w is the angle formed by Jops and Jinit-

The specific value of Lace is estimated as follows. We estimated
the value of Jops using the stellar evolution code MESA (Paxton et al.
2011). Using a stellar evolution tracks that reproduce Kepler-56 on
the HR diagram (our setting is shown in Appendix A), we determined
the gyration radius, 7, = V/;/(M,R;), where J, is the stellar moment
of inertia. Fig. 3 displays the HR diagram (top panel) and relationship
between Rs and ?, (bottom panel) of our evolutionary tracks, showing

F, = 0.38140-00? at the current status of Kepler-56. Thus, we can

estimate /, = 3.43*);7] MoR2, from Kepler-56’s M, and R, (Table 1)
3, Assuming a uniform envelope of Peny = 74 + 3d (Section 2.1.1),
Jobs is estimated to be 2.7-3.9 x 10*? erg - s. Here, we consider the
envelope spin AM as the total spin AM for current Kepler-56 since the
core spin AM is negligible. On the other hand, Fig. 1 shows RGs with

a radius comparable to Kepler-56 satisfy Peny < 150d, inferring that

3 The error range is overestimated by treating the mass and radius uncer-
tainties as independent. Although directly fitting the observed values could
reduce the error by several tens of percent, we did not pursue this owing to the
limited precision of one significant digit and remaining uncertainties (Section
4.3).

MNRAS 000, 1-12 (2025)

a is in the range of 0.5-1.0. Thus, we obtain Lace = 1-4 x 10” erg - s
from Equation (1).

In the scenario reproducing Kepler-56 shown in Section 2.2, the
spin acceleration corresponding to Lace is required. This is the crite-
rion for the feasibility discussion hereafter (Sections 2.3.2 and 2.3.3).
The case where acceleration is not required is discussed in Section
4.1.

2.3.2 AM supply through tides with Kepler-56 b and c

In this section, we explain the process to estimate the amount of
AM supply used for spin acceleration through the tidal interaction
between Kepler-56 b and c, as presented in the first scenario in
Section 2.2.

Under the general prescription, the time evolution of AM in the
star-planet system through the tidal interaction is described by

dh;
a = Tiide,i, (2)
under the conservation of total AM as
J+ » h; = Const. (3)
i

Here, t is the time, J is the spin AM vector of the host star, hj
is the orbital AM vector of the i-th planet and Tyjge,; is the torque
vector through the tidal interaction between the host star and i-th
planet. We note that the spin AM vector of the planet is neglected
in this formulation because the planetary spin is easily synchronised
(Guillot et al. 1996). Also, we neglect the AM loss due to magnetic
braking (the validity is discussed in Section 4.3.2).

Assuming that all planetary orbits are circular and coplanar, which
are satisfied in the observed Kepler-56 system (see Section 2.1), the
norm of the orbital AM vector is described as

assumption, the norm of tidal torque can be formulated by using the
dimensionless quality factor of the star, Q’, as

Rony Ms \*(_9
[Diiae,il = G (1+) (a): (3)

in a traditional framework (Goldreich & Soter 1966; Murray & Der-
mott 1999). We note that the physical definition of Q’ is inversely
proportional to the phase lag between the tidal potential and the tidal
bulge divided by the Love number (see e.g. Ogilvie 2014).

However, there is an uncertainty regarding the expression of Q’
and the direction in which Tjge,; points with respect to J and h;, both
of which are needed to solve Equations (2) and (3). The expression of
the Q’ is currently the subject of debate in terms of theory (Ogilvie
2014; Bolmont & Mathis 2016; Barker 2020, 2026) and observation
(Miyazaki & Masuda 2023; Adams et al. 2024; Tokuno et al. 2024;
Millholland et al. 2025). Also, while there are various suggestions
about the direction of the Diiae,; vector (Hut 1981; Barker & Ogilvie
2009; Lai 2012; Rogers & Lin 2013; Anderson et al. 2021), it is fair
to say that there is no consensus.

On the basis of the above uncertainties, this study applies three
simplifications to focus on the AM supply used for spin acceleration,

Engulfment of a hot Jupiter into Kepler-56 5

which is comparable to Lace (Section 1). First, we assume that the
value of Q’ is constant, which is a classical expression (Goldreich &
Soter 1966; Murray & Dermott 1999). This constant Q’ model can
provide comparable results to non-constant Q’ models (Penev et al.
2014, 2018). Second, we assume that spin-orbit alignment occurs
immediately, which means J, hj and Vyjge,; are all parallel. This
assumption is supported by observational and theoretical evidence
that the efficiency of obliquity damping is much higher than that of
orbital decay (Lai 2012; Saunders et al. 2024a). Third, we assume
that the tidal torque Pyige,; always works in the direction of reducing
h; ,which is equivalent to assuming that the stellar spin is always
slower than the planetary revolution. Since this is not always the
case, this approximation gives the maximum value of AM supply.
Considering the assumption that J and h; are parallel, Pyjae,; is used
entirely for spin acceleration (Equation 3).

By integrating Equations (2), (4) and (5) under these assumptions,
we can calculate the maximum amount of AM supply used for spin
acceleration, Leatc,max, Which is defined as

0
Leatsmax =f YW )
om:

where we set the post-MS stage to t = [-7,0]. The strength of
these approximations is that they reduce the time-dependent stellar
parameter to only R,. In other words, Leatc,max is determined solely by
Rs and planetary parameters. Since the problem reduces to whether
this falls within the range of Lace (Section 2.3.1), there is no need to
solve the stellar AM evolution in post-MS stage, which includes the
uncertainties of internal AM profile (e.g. Aerts et al. 2019).

Using the parameters of Kepler-56 b and c (Table 1) and the initial
positions that reproduce the current status, we calculate Leatc,max
for each Q’. Competing Leatc,max and Lace enables us to estimate the
maximum value of Q’, i.e. the minimum tidal efficiency, necessary to
reproduce the spin profile of Kepler-56 through the tidal interaction
with Kepler-56 b and c. We can examine the feasibility of this scenario
by comparing the results obtained with the range of Q’ ~ 104-108,
which is suggested by previous observations (Penev et al. 2018; Patra
et al. 2020; Vissapragada et al. 2022; Wong et al. 2022; Miyazaki &
Masuda 2023; Adams et al. 2024; Tokuno et al. 2024; Millholland
et al. 2025)*. These observations are of MS stars and subgiants;
nevertheless, because Kepler-56 is in an early RG stage and shares key

properties, such as comparable mass and the presence of a convective
envelope, they serve as a useful basis for comparison.

Regarding the stellar parameters required for calculations, we
adopt the evolution tracks for 1.32 Mg stars calculated by MEsa (see
Appendix A)°. The time interval is defined as the period between
the start of expansion, which is after the contraction at the end of
the MS stage (‘hook’), and the moment when the R, reaches that of
Kepler-56 (Table 1). Also, we assume that all planetary masses are
constant (we discuss the validity in Section 4.3.1).

2.3.3 AM supply through engulfment of hot Jupiter

In this section, we discuss AM supply in the second scenario in
Section 2.2, where an HJ that originally existed is engulfed.
As discussed in Section 2.3.2, we integrate Equations (2), (4) and

4 Recent studies have questioned the observation of Kepler-1658, the star
corresponding to the upper limit of this range (Winn & Stefansson 2025).
Taking this into account, the range becomes Q’ ~ 10°-108.

the results did not change significantly.

(5) for Kepler-56 b and c, and the engulfed planet. We calculate the
amount of AM supplied by the engulfment assuming that the orbital
AM is entirely transported to the spin AM when the semi-major axis
becomes equal to the stellar radius (Lau et al. 2025).

As parameters, the mass Mp) eng and the orbital period Poy, at the
initial conditions for the engulfed HJ are added. For each Q’, we can
determine the range of (Mpl.eng. Porb,eng) Where Lace can be supplied
and the added planet is engulfed during the time interval. Comparing
this range of (Mpieng, Porb,eng) With the observed population of HJs
around F-type MS stars, we can discuss the feasibility of this scenario.

The observed population of HJs is retrieved from the NASA
Exoplanet Archive (Akeson et al. 2013; Christiansen et al. 2025).
From this catalogue of observed planetary systems, we extract the
planets satisfying the following conditions: M, = 1.20-1.45Mo,
Mp, = 0.1Myj, Pow < 10.5d, and the host star is in the MS stage.
The third condition corresponds to the requirement that the engulfed
HJ should orbit inside Kepler-56 b (Section 2.2). In particular, since
we present scenarios in which the planetary orbits are misaligned
with the stellar spin (Section 2.2), we extracted HJs whose projected
obliquity measured by the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect exceeds 50
degrees (see also Appendix B).

3 RESULT
3.1 Reproducibility of Kepler-56 by tides in Kepler-56 b and c

Fig. 4 shows the time evolution of the orbital periods of Kepler-
56 b and ¢ and the amount of maximised AM supply for the spin
acceleration through the tidal interaction with Kepler-56 b and c at
each Q’. The coloured circles at the right end of panel (c) show the
total amount of maximised AM supply (Leate,max; See Equation 6) for
each Q’. The relationship between Leatcmax and Q’ is summarized
in Fig. 5.

By comparison with Lace (grey shaded regions) in Fig. 5, we can
find that the extremely high tidal efficiency of Q’ = 107!-107 (red
hatched region) is required to accelerate Kepler-56’s spin. This is
attributed to the required AM for spin-up is similar to or greater than
the orbital AM of the current Kepler-56 b and Kepler-56 c. In such
cases, it is necessary to place the initial orbit at a location far away
from the current orbit, which is Pory 2 50d in this case (see panels
(a) and (b) in Fig. 4). Thus, the strong tidal efficiency is needed to
bring the current position. Appendix C shows the explanation of this
trend through the analytic formulation.

The extremely strong tides with Q’ = 10-!—10 suggested here
appear unreasonable, as they deviate from the observation-based
range of Q’ = 104-108 (blue hatched region in Fig. 5). It should be
noted, though, that such extremely strong tides in RGs cannot yet be
completely ruled out, since the observational constraints are based
on MS stars and subgiants. To constrain the tidal efficiency in RGs
through future observations, transit-timing variations of RG systems
are expected to be an effective approach. For Kepler-56, however,
this is challenging because the system exhibits large perturbations
arising from dynamical interactions (Huber et al. 2013).

Nevertheless, the existence of Kepler-56 b/c and other hot Jupiters
around RGs (Temmink & Snellen 2023; Pereira et al. 2024) remains
consistent with our results, as such systems would hardly be observ-
able if extremely strong tides were universal. Theoretical calculations
by Esseldeurs et al. (2024) also support this view, suggesting that tides
in the convective envelope do not reach such extreme efficiencies
during the early RG stage for systems with stellar mass, evolutionary
stage, and orbital periods similar to those of the Kepler-56 system.

values at tf = 0, which means the total amount of maximised AM supply, are
highlighted with the circle symbols. For comparison, Lace is shown as the
grey shaded region (see Section 2.3.1).

The above considerations indicate that acceleration from a spin rate
comparable to those of typical RGs to the rapid spin rate observed in
Kepler-56 is difficult by tidal interactions between Kepler-56 b and
Kepler-56 c alone. This suggests the necessity of a companion that
originally existed inside the orbit of Kepler-56 b (see Sections 3.2
and 4.2).

It should be emphasized that this conclusion based on the as-
sumption of the slow spin rate of Kepler 56 at the initial conditions.
This does not apply if Kepler-56 was spinning rapidly at the initial
conditions. This case is discussed in Section 4.1.

3.2 Required conditions for engulfed hot Jupiter

The results of Section 3.1 simplify the interpretation of the require-
ment that engulfed HJ to reproduce Kepler-56, as discussed in Section
2.3.3. Fig. 5 shows that Kepler-56 b and c can only supply an AM of
less than a few per cent of Lace under the observation-based Q’ range,
Q’ = 104-108. It means that the contributions of Kepler-56 b and c
are subdominant under the assumption that an engulfed HJ supplies
Lacc. Considering the AM supply of the engulfed HJ matches the
initial orbital AM, the capability to supply Lace for the engulfed HJ
is determined mostly by the initial orbital AM and is almost indepen-
dent of Q’. Thus, Q’ can be treated as the parameter that determines
only whether the planet can engulf or not. We note that the calculation
of Section 2.3.3 confirms that the above considerations are correct.

Therefore, for the engulfed HJ, we can consider separately the ca-
pability to supply Lace and the requirement that the planet undergoes
the engulfment during the post-MS stage. We can calculate the for-
mer by calculating the constraint that the initial orbit AM falls within
the range of Lace. This result is not affected by the approximation
of the expressions in Section 2.3.2 or the uncertainty of Q’. On the
other hand, the latter is discussed by the calculation in Section 2.3.3,
which may be affected by the approximation performed in Section
2.3.2 (specifically described in several paragraphs later).

On the basis of the considerations above, Fig. 6 shows the require-
ment of (Mpi,eng, Porb,eng) for the engulfed HJ to reproduce Kepler-
56. The blue shaded region in Fig. 6 represents the region where the
AM supply through the engulfment reaches Lacc. The dashed line
shows the criteria for the planetary engulfment at each Q’. We also
plot the observed HJs around 1.20 — 1.45 Mo MS stars (see Section
2.3.3).

From Fig. 6, we can find that the region determined based on the
capability of AM supply is consistent with the observed HJ pop-
ulation. It means that the engulfment of ‘typical’ HJ could supply
the AM necessary to reproduce Kepler-56. Specifically, an HJ with
Mpieng = 0.5-2 My and Porb,eng = 1-6 is preferred from the obser-

its engulfment. The broken lines indicate the criteria for a planet to undergo
engulfment at the given Q’. The area to the left of the broken line is the
region where the planet can engulf at each Q’, and the colour of the broken
line represents the value of O’. HJs whose orbits are known to be misaligned
are marked with filled circles, while those that are unknown are marked with
open ones. The grey areas on the left and right sides indicate regions where
HJ cannot exist due to the properties of the Kepler-56 system. The left side is
the region where the orbit is inside the star in the MS stage, and the right side
is the region where the orbit is outside the orbit of Kepler-56 b (see Section
2.2).

vation. The fact that the samples within that range include the systems
with large spin-orbit obliquity (filled circle in Fig. 6) ensures that our
scenario of an engulfment of misaligned HJ is possible. However, it
should be noted that the actual required mass may be larger due to
the effects ignored in this analysis (see Section 4.3).

It can also be seen that engulfment of HJ in this range can be
achieved with Q’ = 10° — 108. This is consistent with the obser-
vational constraints of Q’. It should be noted that a stronger tidal
efficiency is actually required since the calculations here are based
on the assumption that tidal torque is always transferred from the
planet to the star and works entirely on orbital decay (see Section
2.3.3). However, since an HJ in this region generally has orbital revo-
lution faster than the stellar spin, the approximation should introduce
only a minor error.

These results suggest that the engulfment of an HJ that origi-
nally existed inside Kepler-56 b can reproduce the spin structure of
Kepler-56. In other words, Kepler-56 has the potential to serve as a
benchmark for investigating the impact of planetary engulfment (see
Sections 4.4 and 4.5).

4 DISCUSSION
4.1 Possibility of rapid initial-spin

The results of this study are based on the assumption that the rapid
spin of Kepler-56 is due to AM supply in the post-MS stage (Sections
2.2 and 2.3.1). In this section, we consider the situation where spin-up
is completed at the initial condition, which corresponds to Jinit = Jobs
in Section 2.3.1.

Specifically, we examine the efficiency of obliquity damping to re-
produce Kepler-56 by Kepler-56 b and c. If we assume that the orbital
periods of Kepler-56 b and c are constant and calculate Equations
(2), (4) and (5), we find that ~ 10*7(10*/Q") erg - s can be used for
obliquity damping. It is emphasized that Q’ refers to the efficiency
of obliquity damping, whereas the Q’ discussed in Sections 3 re-
ferred to the efficiency of tidal acceleration. To achieve an internal
spin misalignment of 60 degrees or more in Kepler-56 (Section 2.2),
an AM supply of Jgamp, Which satisfies Jaamp 2 Jobs 2 10% erg - s
(Section 2.3.1), is required. Thus, the efficiency of obliquity damp-
ing corresponding to Q’ < 107. Saunders et al. (2024a) show that
Q’ for obliquity damping is roughly 10+ times smaller than that for
tidal acceleration, that is to say, show that Q’ = 10° — 10* for obliq-
uity damping (cf. Section 2.3.2). Therefore, if Kepler-56 does not
require any acceleration, obliquity damping by Kepler-56 b/c alone
is sufficient to explain the spin profile of Kepler-56.

In such cases, however, we need to consider the process generating
rapid spin. One scenario involves achieving rapid spin rate within the
diversity of single stars. While magnetic braking reduces stellar AM,
magnetic braking in F-type MS stars only occurs during the late phase
of the MS stage (van Saders & Pinsonneault 2013; Beyer & White
2024). Therefore, it may be possible for stars to enter the RG stage
while maintaining a rapid spin rate. However, this scenario raises
several concerns: Kepler-56 deviates from the spin rate distribution
of typical RGs (Fig. 1), which may represent the diversity at the end of
the MS stage °; and Kepler-56’s metal-rich composition deepens its
surface convection zone, which enhances the efficiency of magnetic
braking (Amard & Matt 2020; See et al. 2024).

Another scenario involves AM transfer from a companion. As
shown in Section 4.2, the presence of Kepler-56 b/c makes binary
interactions unlikely in the Kepler-56 system. Thus, the engulfment
of a hot Jupiter again becomes a plausible scenario, in which case
not only tidal forces but also mechanical scattering are candidates as
mechanisms causing the the engulfment. As discussed in Section 2.2,
planetary engulfment during the MS stage is expected not to create
internal spin misalignment via internal angular momentum transport.
Thus, unlike the setting in this study, a scenario is suggested in which
the stellar spin becomes rapid and globally misaligned after the en-
gulfment of a hot Jupiter, with only the envelope later realigning
during the post—MS phase. This implies that the engulfed hot Jupiter
had an orbit inclined relative to the current orbits of Kepler-56 b/c.
While this naively suggests a system hosting a single inclined hot
Jupiter, it is unlikely to form or maintain such a configuration. A
more plausible scenario involves the observed massive outer planet,
Kepler-56 d: the orbits of the engulfed hot Jupiter and Kepler-56 b/c
were initially aligned, but after the early engulfment, the orbits of
Kepler-56 b/c gradually became inclined through dynamical inter-
actions with Kepler-56 d before the star reached the post—MS stage
(Huber et al. 2013; Li et al. 2014).

© This inference is based on the rough agreement on AM between few old
F-type MS stars studied in asteroseismology (Hall et al. 2021) and RG in
Fig. 1 (Liet al. 2024).

MNRAS 000, 1-12 (2025)

In any case, further investigation of F-type main sequence stars
and hot Jupiter systems is requires for examining feasibility of rapid
initial-spin.

4.2 Scenario involving heavier companion

In this paper, we focused on the engulfment of HJ among
merger/engulfment processes with a companion, obtaining the feasi-
ble scenario (Section 3.2). The results are based on the assumption,
which is considered reasonable in HJ, that all orbital AM is trans-
ferred to Kepler-56’s spin AM through the engulfment. However,
even through the merger process with a heavier companion such as
a brown dwarf and low-mass star, Kepler-56 may be reproducible if
the efficiency of AM supply in the merger process is not high. In fact,
this situation is often considered in the common envelope process
(e.g. Ivanova et al. 2013).

While this efficiency is unknown, making it difficult to evalu-
ate quantitatively, considerations about circumbinary planets pro-
vide severe constraints on the stellar-merger scenario. If Kepler-56
is the by-product of a stellar merger, Kepler-56 b and c would have
originally been close-in circumbinary planets around a short-period
binary. However, it is considered that such a system would be difficult
to form from the perspectives of both formation process (Moriwaki
& Nakagawa 2004; Silsbee & Rafikov 2015) and orbital stability
(Hamers et al. 2016; Fleming et al. 2018). In fact, no such system has
ever been observed (Armstrong et al. 2014; Martin et al. 2015). That
is to say, in order to reproduce the environment in which planets
already exist around Kepler-56, it is preferable to assume that the
original companion is lightweight, preferring an HJ. In this regard,
the numerical simulation of long-term orbital evolution may provide
quantitative constraints.

Additionally, the trend of chemical composition also disfavours
the stellar-merger scenario. The carbon and nitrogen abundance of
RGs, which is determined by the depth of the convective region and
the rate of CNO burning, is strongly correlated with stellar mass and
metallicity (e.g. Iben 1964; Martig et al. 2016; Bufanda et al. 2023).
If there is a significant mass supply, such as a stellar merger, these
elements may deviate from the trends of analogous RGs. However,
as shown in Section 4.4, Kepler-56 exhibits a consistent composition
with analogous RGs.

4.3 Impact of additional effect

This section discusses the impact on the results of effects neglected
in this study, namely planetary atmospheric escape and magnetic
braking.

4.3.1 Atmospheric escape of hot Jupiter

In this study, the planetary mass was fixed as a constant (Section
2). However, it is considered that the mass and radius of close-in
planets decrease through atmospheric escape by the stellar radiation
(e.g. Owen 2019). This shifts the range of required planetary masses
toward heavier masses than those shown in Fig. 6.

Specifically, the criterion for whether a planet can maintain its en-
velope is thought to be whether it is heavier than ~ 1 My (Kurokawa
& Nakamoto 2014). Based on this criterion, under an HJ which sat-
isfies the conditions described in Section 3.2, that with = 1 My may
not be significantly affected and that with < 1 My may be unable to
achieve a sufficient AM supply. As a result, the engulfment of the
more massive and closer HJ is considered to be preferable. More
detailed investigations require calculations that simultaneously solve
the evolution of planetary atmosphere for each individual initial con-
dition.

4.3.2 Magnetic Braking

In this study, AM loss due to the magnetic braking was neglected
in Section 2.3.2. However, the magnetic braking may need to be
considered for rapidly-spinning red giants like Kepler-56 (Privitera
et al. 2016b; Ong et al. 2024). If the discussion for main-sequence
stars is extended to red giants, the efficiency of magnetic braking is
expected to be governed by the Rossby number, defined as the ratio of
the rotation period to the convective turnover time; Magnetic braking
operates when the Rossby number is below unity (van Saders et al.
2016; Tokuno et al. 2023; Saunders et al. 2024b; Metcalfe et al. 2025),
and its efficiency increases as the Rossby number decreases (e.g. van
Saders & Pinsonneault 2013; Matt et al. 2015). Empirical estimate
of Lehtinen et al. (2020) suggests that the convective turnover time
of Kepler-56 is ~ 1 yr, corresponding to a Rossby number of ~ 0.2.
Therefore, the magnetic braking likely works on Kepler-56 efficiently.

If the AM loss due to magnetic braking is effective, Kepler-56
would have been spinning more rapid than the current spin rate.
Thus, the required angular momentum to accelerate Kepler-56 (Lace
in Section 2.3.1) increases. This increases the required tidal efficiency
for acceleration by Kepler-56 b/c in Section 3.1 and increases the
required mass for engulfed hot Jupiters in Section 3.2. However, it
is difficult to determine the extent of this increase, as it depends on
the efficiency of magnetic braking, which is not yet well established
in the RG stage (e.g. Ceillier et al. 2017), and on the timing of
absorption, which is difficult to investigate.

4.4 Chemical abundance of Kepler-56

It is suggested that planetary engulfment may alter the chemical
abundance at the stellar surface (Zuckerman et al. 2010; Oh et al.
2018; Spina et al. 2021; Liu et al. 2024). Here, we examine the chem-
ical characteristics of Kepler-56 relative to the analogues RGs. From
the APOKASC3 catalogue (Pinsonneault et al. 2025), we extracted
RGs with 1.20 — 1.45 Mo for mass and R, = 3.0—6.0 Rg for radius.
After that, we retrieved the chemical abundance for each star from
the results of APOGEE DR17 (Abdurro’ uf et al. 2022).

Fig. 7 shows the relationship between the metallicity and the abun-
dance for each element. We find that the surface composition of
Kepler-56 falls within the range of dispersion of analogues RGs.
This result is consistent with the claim that compositional changes
due to the planetary engulfment are comparable to or smaller than
primordial dispersion (Behmard et al. 2023b).

Tayar et al. (2022) performed a similar analysis on another rapidly
rotating RG, KIC 9267654, and also showed that no peculiar chemical
composition was detected. If Kepler-56 or KIC 9267654 are actually
experiencing the planetary engulfment, this trend suggests that it
may be difficult to detect signatures of planetary engulfment in their
chemical compositions. Thus, in order to investigate the trace of
engulfment in RGs from their composition, it may be necessary to
use a method that is less affected by primordial dispersion, e.g. the
relative differences with a binary companion (Behmard et al. 2023a).

4.5 Implication for other systems

This section discusses the implications of our findings for the forma-
tion process of other RGs with rapid spin or internal spin misalign-
ment.

Many rapidly spinning RGs have been discovered by photometric
or spectroscopic analyses (Carlberg et al. 2011, 2013; Tayar et al.
2015, 2022; Ceillier et al. 2017; Patton et al. 2024; Dhanpal et al.
2025). Engulfment of HJ is considered important as a possible for-
mation process for such objects, but remains suggestive because of
indistinguishability from other scenarios. In this respect, Kepler-56
is a valuable object that is strongly suggested to have undergone
the engulfment of HJ. This is attributed to further peculiarities of
Kepler-56: its internal spin misalignment that is difficult to form in
a single star, and the presence of a nearby planet that imposes strong
constraints (Sections 2.2 and 4.2). This suggestion that one of the
rapidly spinning RGs may be formed by planetary engulfment high-
lights the importance of planetary engulfment in the AM evolution
of RGs.

On the other hand, it is unlikely that all rapidly spinning RGs were
created by planetary engulfment. The proportion of rapidly spinning
RGs is several per cent of all RGs (Carlberg et al. 2011; Tayar et al.
2015; Patton et al. 2024), while less than 0.5 per cent of stars have HJs
(Beleznay & Kunimoto 2022). Furthermore, some fast-rotating RGs
have such enormous AM that they cannot be supplied by the planetary
engulfment (v sini > 20km/s). Therefore, most rapidly rotating RGs
should be considered to be by-products of binary interaction (Tayar
et al. 2015; Patton et al. 2024).

Currently, the only star with an internal spin axis misalignment
is Kepler-56. However, such stars are considered to be formed at a
certain proportion through the interaction with a companion with a
misaligned orbit. In fact, a misaligned HJ is common around A-type
or F-type MS stars, which may become systems like Kepler-56 in
the future (Winn et al. 2010; Albrecht et al. 2011, see also Appendix
B). Due to the difficulty of maintaining the misalignment with the
heavier companion, the stars resulting from planetary engulfment,
as with Kepler-56, may be observed preferentially. Thus, in order
to understand the effects of planetary engulfment, it is important to
investigate objects with internal spin misalignment, which may be
achieved through future analyses, such as the PLAnetary Transits and
Oscillations of stars (PLATO) mission (Rauer et al. 2014, 2025).

5 SUMMARY

Kepler-56 has provoked discussion due to its unique spin structure,
namely, rapid envelope spin and internal spin misalignment, revealed
by recent asteroseismic analyses (Ong 2025). These features strongly
suggest past interactions with a companion star, making this an ideal
object for verifying the stellar angular momentum (AM) evolution
through such interactions. This paper aims to investigate the feasible
scenario to reproduce the spin structure of Kepler-56 through the
AM transfers with planets. In particular, we examined the follow-
ing two scenarios from the perspective of whether acceleration from
the spin rate observed in typical RGs to Kepler-56’ spin rate could
be reproduced: (1) AM supply via tides with the observed planets,
Kepler-56 b and c, and (2) AM supply through the engulfment of a
hot Jupiter (HJ) that originally existed inside the observed planets.
By solving simplified equations for AM evolution, we constrained
the minimum tidal efficiency for acceleration through tidal interac-
tion with the observed planets and derived the properties of HJ for
acceleration through its engulfment.

of Kepler-56 and analogues RGs (1.20-1.45 Mo for mass and 3.0-6.0 Ro for radius) are represented by the black circles and the orange star-shaped symbol,
respectively. All values are retrieved in the catalogues of APOGEE DR17 (Abdurro’uf et al. 2022) and APOKASC3 (Pinsonneault et al. 2025).

The main results of this study are as follows. First, we showed
that acceleration of Kepler-56 solely through tidal interaction with
the known close-in planets requires a tidal efficiency far exceeding
observational constraints. This result suggests a scenario in which the
engulfment of a companion that originally existed supplies AM under
the assumption that Kepler 56’s spin rate was originally equivalent to
those of typical RGs. Second, we demonstrated that an HJ with a mass
of 0.5—2 Jupiter masses and a spin period of approximately 1-6 days,
if present during the main-sequence stage, can accelerate Kepler-56
without conflicting with the observations. It should be emphasized
that, if Kepler-56 was initially rapidly spinning, it might be possible to
reproduce Kepler-56 solely through the obliquity damping of Kepler-
56 b/c. However, in that case, some scenario would be necessary to
achieve the initial rapid spin rate, including planetary engulfment.

These results highlight the importance of Kepler-56 as the bench-
mark star showing traces of planetary engulfment and demonstrate
the significance of the planetary engulfment for the stellar AM evo-
lution.

APPENDIX A: MESA CALCULATION

In this paper, we calculate the evolutionary tracks of Kepler-56 by
the stellar evolution code mesa (r24.08.1). Our settings of major
parameters are listed in Table Al. We do not include an overshooting
process. ignore the mass-loss by stellar winds because its contribution
is negligible. As a supplement, calculations were also performed for
[Fe/H] = 0.05 and 0.35 (see Table 1 but there are little impacts on
our results.

APPENDIX B: LIST OF MISALIGNED HOT JUPITERS

Table B1 shows a list of HJs around F-type MS stars with a pro-
jected spin-orbit obliquity of more than 50 degrees (Section 2.3.3
and Fig. 6). These systems are expected to create RGs with spin
structures like Kepler-56 in the future. We note that none of these
systems were found to be multiple planetary systems like the Kepler-
56 system.

APPENDIX C: INTEGRATION OF [ripe

In this study, we conduct numerical integration of Equation (6) based
on the time evolution of R, (Section 2.3.2). However, assuming R, to
be constant, the integration of Equation (6) can be solved analytically.
This integral helps in understanding the behaviour shown in Fig. 5.

Considering the initial condition n;(0) = n;,9 at t = 0, we obtain

where T is an arbitrarily selectable time interval and Q/., is the

From Equations (2), (4), (6), (C1) and (C2), the amount of AM supply
during t = [0,7] is given by

i

yy 1/13
Leatezmax = > Wilr=0 f + a ] -1]. (C3)
Equation (C3) closely approximates the relationship in Fig. 5 when
the values of Kepler-56, R,; ~ 3Rg and T ~ 1 Gyr, are substituted.
We note that the values of Q/,, for Kepler-56 b and c in that case are
roughly 7 x 10° and 2 x 104, respectively.

It can be seen that AM supply is proportional to Q’ when Q’ >
Q/ 4 ;. and that its dependence on Q’ is very weak when Q’ < Deri
which is shown in Fig. 5. It indicates the difficulty of supplying AM
exceeding the current orbital AM, |/1;|,;-0 (see Section 3.1).
