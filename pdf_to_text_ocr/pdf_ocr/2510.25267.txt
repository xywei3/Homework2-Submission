Abstract

Self diffraction is a four-wave mixing process proportional to the square modulus of
third-order nonlinearity susceptibility y), which is related to the material’s electronic
and thermal properties. In this study, we investigate the wavelength dependence of the
self-diffracted signal generated by a femtosecond pulsed laser in a dye solution to directly
evaluate the electronic third-order nonlinear susceptibility spectrum. By accounting for
absorption effects and phase matching conditions, we determine the [x] for different

concentrations. Experimental results complemented with theoretical predictions, show
that in the low absorption and thin sample limits, the signal reproduce the | x2) spectral
profile. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of measuring nonlinear susceptibility
spectra arising solely from the bound-electronic response across a wide spectral range

and for various compounds.

In recent years, nonlinear optics has opened new pathways for manipulating light—matter
interactions at the nanoscale and enabling a wide range of applications. Some of them include
all-optical signal processing as well as the generation of entangled photon pairs for quantum
communication protocols .'4 For this purpose, the identification of the appropriate mate-
rial with a substantial effective nonlinear susceptibility within a specified spectral range is
essential for the efficient implementation of all-optical modulation. A number of techniques
enable the experimental determination of the third order susceptibility (®)) of a given

medium, such as Z-scan ,*° beam deflection ,7°

and four-wave mixing (FWM) techniques
.910 Tn the field of material science, Z-scan has been extensively adopted for the character-
ization of diverse compounds.'!!* This is primarily attributed to its relative simplicity in
comparison to alternative methods. However, such an experimental approach necessitates
the scanning of the sample’s position along the beam’s focus, namely Z-values, for each
wavelength excitation, hindering spectral investigation and providing a limitation for fragile
samples, as it requires multiple laser shots to obtain the Z-scan profile. Conversely, it should
be noted that beam deflection experiments are limited to materials where the absorption is
sufficiently small so that electromagnetic radiation throughout the sample is constant, and
a full description of the beam shape propagating through optics is mandatory.!* Finally,
the wavelength scan of a FWM signal, depending on the specific implemented process, is
subject to intensity modulation, based on the phase-matching conditions (PMCs), and beam
direction modulation, due to the sum of photon momenta. These effects prevent an easy
spectral detection of y)(A). Among the FWM schemes, one is transient grating (TG), in
which two degenerate pump beams induce a spatial transient grating by interference effects,

which a probe pulse can monitor being deflected in a specific direction. !
This study illustrates a methodology for measuring |y)(\)|, through a. self-diffraction
(SD) scheme. SD can be described as the degenerate case of TG, whereby one pump beam
probes the action of itself through the nonlinear medium. ‘© !* Different from TG experiments,
the SD technique is not capable of studying the dynamics of the transient excitation process
due to the absence of a delayed probe beam. Moreover, the wavelength of the probe beam
being equivalent to that of the pump does not allow to completely fulfill the PMCs. In
ref.18 a SD scheme was employed to measure the nonlinear susceptibility of Cresyl violet
(CygHigCIN30) with light pulses of 20 ps. However, the effect of the pulses’ impinging
angle was not taken into account. Moreover, the utilization of ps pulses was also unable
to fully disentangle significant non-instantaneous mechanisms due to nuclear motions on
the nonlinear medium response .”* This may result in an overestimation of the electronic
|x) (A)| value, as observed by means of Z-scan measurements conducted on the same Methyl
Blue molecule (CAS no. 28983-56-4, BLDpharm) under investigation in the present study
.820 Therein, the transition from the femtosecond pulses to the continuous wave regime
induces an approximate 7 orders of magnitude difference in the estimation of the |“) ()|
value. Therefore, it is imperative to employ a femtosecond pulsed laser to suppress any
non-electronic contributions to the nonlinear response.

The considered optical configuration for the SD experimental setup is illustrated in Figure

la. The pulsed laser source (Pharos, PH2-20W-SP, Light Conversion) has a central wave-

length of 1030 + 10nm and a pulse duration of approximately 190fs. Pulses with repetition
rate of 10 kHz and energy of 180 uJ per pulse are employed to feed an optical parametric
amplifier (OPA), to achieve wavelength-tunable pulses with tpwum ~ 50 fs. The emitted
wavelength from the OPA (ORPHEUS-F, Light Conversion) is controlled by a sequence of
motors, enabling an automated wavelength scan. Subsequent to the OPA a 50:50 fused
silica beam splitter of thickness / = 5 mm is positioned at an angle of 45° with respect to
the propagation direction. Considering the requirement of temporal overlap between the

two beams, a delay line was utilized to obtain time overlap on the sample. In order to

Figure 1: a) SD experimental setup scheme. Starting from the bottom, the fs pulse emitted
by an OPA enters the optical path. A 50:50 plate beam splitter divides the pump into two
equivalent beams, 1 and 2. Beams 1 and 2 are focused by a lens with focal length of 10 cm
before reaching a 10 jum thick sample with angle of incidence —@ and 0, respectively. Time-
overlap is tuned by a delay line in beam 1 path. The temporal chromatic dispersion on the
two arms are balanced by a compensation plate. After the sample, a second lens with a focal
length of 20 cm collimates the SD signal towards a CCD, whose typical example is shown in
the colormap. The inset provides a visual representation of the SD process in our reference
frame. b) Measured imaginary part of the linear susceptibility normalized by the molecular

achieve a time overlap condition independent on wavelength, the temporal dispersion arising

from the propagation through the beam splitter in arm 2 is compensated by a fused silica
compensation plate, inserted in arm 1. Subsequently, both beams are directed through a

common spherical lens (f = 10 cm) and impinge on the sample at the same spatial position,

with incident at angles of +@ with respect to the sample’s surface normal. The sample is
10 m-thick Methyl Blue dispersed in water, contained in a quartz cuvette. The signal at
Asp ~ 36 is then collimated by a lens with focal length of 20 cm and focused towards a CCD
camera (Basler acA780-75gm). Within the framework of the proposed methodology, the SD
signal maintains a consistent direction throughout a wavelength scan, thereby enabling the
study of the SD signal as a function of wavelength without the necessity for adjustment of
the setup geometry. Consequently, the measurement’s typical duration is approximately a

few minutes per spectrum.

show the |y| spectra, which were retrieved by rescaling the SD intensities using (1). The
green lines show the sum of the two Gaussian-convoluted Lorentzian components of ||,
which are shown as the green dotted and dashed lines.

The optimum position for the sample with respect to the focal point is a trade-off between

two competing effects. The amount of nonlinear modulation increases with the peak intensity,
see S.I., reaching the maximum at the minimum spot size. Conversely, in the event of
spot sizes being too small, a low number of interference fringes, due to the refractive index
modulation, is sensed by the third probing interaction. Consequently, this generates a low-
intensity SD signal, due to the low effective grating yield. For this reason, the sample has
been positioned slightly in front of the lens focal point (1 — 2 em). A superior compromise
could be attained combining cylindrical lenses.

In this experiment, the measurements are conducted within a range of molar concen-
trations (C) of Methyl Blue in water ranging from 1 mM to 25 mM. In Figure 1b, the
imaginary parts of the linear susceptibility spectra are depicted for varying C. The transmis-
sion of diverse solutions was measured, and the imaginary part of the linear susceptibility
was modeled by fitting the retrieved absorbance with two Gaussian components accounting
for the absorption’s inhomogeneous broadening. As C increases, the main component at
~ 630 nm becomes less intense with respect to the side component at ~ 595 nm. It can be
deduced that this occurrence most likely arises from to the formation of aggregates within
the solution, as observed in analogous dye molecules.*+;?? Such aggregates are the responsible
of the side contribution. Consequently, in our model we introduce two effective transition
dipole moments, to take into account the relative concentration between aggregates and
dispersed single molecules, and it is reflected in the nonlinear response of the solution, see
S.L.

Figure 2a shows the intensity of the SD signal as colored dots taken at steps of 2 nm,
normalized by the peak intensity of the two beams. The SD intensity is evaluated considering
the counts of the signal in the CCD image (see insert in Figure la acquired with lms
integration time) and rescaling it by the spectral profile of detector sensitivity, transmission
of lenses, and Fresnel transmission coefficient induced by the sample interfaces. Further
details on the procedure are reported in $.I.. The sample thickness d = 10 wm and the
beams’ angles of incidence with respect to the sample’s normal surface are 6; = @ and

6, = —0, with 0 = 3°.The C range extends from 1 mM (left most column) up to 25 mM
(right most column). At low C the signal exhibits a peak-like shape in correspondence with
the absorption peak (at ~ 630 nm), while at higher C the spectral profile assumes a valley-
like shape. This observation can be rationalized by two competing effects: the nonlinearity,
which is responsible for the peak-like shape, and the linear absorption, responsible for the
suppression of SD signal at ~ 630 nm and the consequent valley-like behavior. By increasing
the concentration of the dye molecule, the absorption becomes increasingly detrimental.

To reproduce our experimental data and extract accordingly the |y)(A)|, we perturba-
tively derive the SD signal generated via Kerr nonlinearity, see S.I., obtaining:

the lack of PMC generates a strong suppression of the SD signal, together with a strong

dependencies on impinging angles and wavelengths. As reported in the S.I., this model is
crucial for the correct choice of the experimental condition in the employed setup corre-
spond to a case with negligible dependence on PMC within the considered spectral range.
Moreover, the imaginary part of dielectric constant - related to absorption and accounted
for by |F (ko, d,¢, 1, 03)/ - induces a suppression of the signal that follows an exponential
proportionality with C.

At this point, two possible approaches can be taken to extract the nonlinear susceptibility
spectrum from SD signal. By applying (1), the values of || can be directly extracted from
the SD measurements, as shown in Figure 2c by the colored squares. The retrieved spectra are
obtained by properly rescaling the SD intensities by |F|?. The latter can be constructed from
the measured dielectric permittivity of the sample ¢(A), whose imaginary part is reported
as colored triangles in Figure 2b, as detailed in the S.I.. In the lower concentration regime,
F is observed to be a slowly varying function, and the |y)| shape closely reflects the SD
signal. Conversely, increasing C results in the development of a dip in F, closely mirroring
the shape of the SD signal. In this case, the proper determination of |®)| is achieved by
taking into account ¢(A), given the significant correlation between F and e(A). An alternative
approach to retrieve |y“)| implies a complete unbiased fitting of the SD signal, where the
molecular effective transition electric dipole is treated as the fitting parameter. Specifically,
each transition allows to calculate ¢(A) and |®)| and, consequently, the SD signal can be
calculated by (1). Then, by properly fitting the SD signal, a self consistent derivation of
optical response of the system can be obtained. In agreement with the results reported
in Figure 1b, we consider two electric dipoles to represent the optical response of the dye
compound. By properly tuning the effective dipoles moments, we calculate the green dashed
lines shown in Figure 2b, whose sum is in excellent agreement with the experimental results.
As described in the 8.1., the calculation of the optical parameters adopted to reproduce the
data involves two Lorentzian contributions for Imy and |y“)|. Both are convolved with
the Gaussian profile associated to each transition, showed as dotted line in Figure 1b, to

account for inhomogeneous broadening (sce S.I.). Each contribution is shown as a green line

in Figure 2b-c. The excellent agreement between the |y“)| spectra obtained using the two
different methods testifies the reliability of the procedure. However, the fitting procedure
provides greater insight into the dynamics observed as a function of C in relation to the
rescaling procedure. The validity of the fitting procedure is also confirmed by the almost
linear proportionality with NV of both |y®| and Imy“ components. Moreover, the evolution
of the two Gaussian contributions with C, reported in Figure 1b and Figure 2b-c, is well
reproduced by the model. It is worth notice that in the limit of low C, or for a weakly
absorbing medium, the determination of Imy becomes unnecessary, since the features of
the || spectrum closely follow those of the SD signal.

Finally, Fig 3 shows the SD signal, which has been normalized by the peak intensity of
the two beams, as acquired at C' = 10 mM for several peak intensities. Considering the signal

proportional to J?, the error bars decrease in conjunction with an increase in beam’s power.
,
As evidenced by the experimental results, the spectral shape of the normalized SD signal does
not depend on the beams power. Moreover, the integrated SD signal is anticipated to adhere
to a third-order power law, as expected by an homodyne third order effect. This dependence
is shown in the insert in Figure 3, where the integral over the wavelength of the SD signal is
reported as a function of the impinging power, thereby confirming the third-order nonlinear
nature of SD.

In summary, the present study reports the measurement of the electronic third-order
nonlinear susceptibility spectrum using a SD experimental setup. Furthermore, a model was
developed to successfully reproduce the data and the corresponding PMC modulation, even
when linear absorption has a strong detrimental effect on the nonlinear process. Such a model
is fundamental for the choice of correct sample thickness, incidence angle, and concentration,
able to suppress linear contributions and modulation induced by phase mismatch, providing
a touchstone for the next design of SD experiment. The results demonstrate the capability of
measuring the wavelength dependence of |‘?)(X)|, thus opening up new avenues for research
that will facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of the role of resonances in nonlinear

optical interactions.
