We investigate the solution of the Klein-Gordon equation for a charged scalar timelike (k, =
(w,0,0,nw)) particle in an electromagnetic plane wave background which can be realized in a
medium with a refractive index n < 1. We reduce the equation of motion to the Mathieu equation,
which has resonant exponentially growing solutions for certain parameter ranges. We show that
this resonance indeed occurs for small scalar masses. We apply our results to derive constraints on
millicharged particles and compare them with existing experimental data.

I. INTRODUCTION

Particle production in an intense external field is still
an intriguing phenomenon. The presence of the external
field modifies the wave function of outgoing particles, al-
lowing some processes forbidden in the standard pertur-
bation theory based on the plane wave decomposition.
A famous example is the Schwinger effect — electron-
positron pair production in an external electric field [1]
and related processes (see books and reviews [2-5]). An-
other nonperturbative effect related only to the case of
boson production is the Bose enhancement: the produc-
tion rate resonantly grows if final particles produced in
the background of already presented occupied state of
the same field.

This effect appears in cosmology as so-called preheat-
ing after inflation when an oscillating heavy inflaton field
resonantly decays to the matter scalars [6-9], see also the
book [10]. Mathematically, the equation of motion for

roduced scalar modes of fixed wavevector k reduces to
he Mathieu equation, which parametric plane has bands
of periodic and exponentially growing solutions, see book
11).

The similar effect appears in a toy model if an intense
lane wave of massive or massless scalar field decays to
another spice of scalars [12, 13]. Massive plane wave with
he help of a relativistic boost reduces to the preheat-
ing case, showing the Mathieu stability band picture [13]
while the massless plane wave resonantly produces par-
icles only due to the tachyonic instability in that toy
model Lagrangian [12].

In this article, we are looking for the generalization of
he aforementioned mechanism to the particle produc-
ion in an electromagnetic plane wave background. It
is well-known that a plane wave of electromagnetic field
in vacuum (squared 4-momentum vanishes, k? = 0) is
stable: there is no tachyonic instability or the Schwinger

effect in such field configuration [1]. Besides the plane
wave in vacuum, one can consider plane waves in differ-
ent types of media, obtaining both k? < 0 in standard
crystals and k? > 0 in thermal plasma or in some types
of metamaterials [14-19].
In k? > 0 background the photon became effectively
massive; in the presence of charged particles with small
masses in the theory one expects the similar type of par-
ticle production as for scalars [13].
Such particles with tiny electric charges are actively
discussed as one of “new physics” extensions of the Stan-
dard model and are called millicharged particles (mCP)
[20-24]. Besides, mCP emerges in cosmology as a candi-
date for the dark matter particle alone or as part of wider
dark sector models [21, 25-31]. Searches for these par-
ticles are conducted in various experiments [32-36] and
astrophysical observations [37-41].
The wave function for scalar electrons in a medium
with nontrivial n has been studied in [42-45]. It was
shown that the equation for the wave function reduces
o the Mathieu equation, which solution is finite or in-
finitely grows in different bands of the parametric plane.
The growing solution was considered in [42-45] as un-
physical: in fact, the Schrodinger equation with normal-
ized wave function was solved. In this article, we reveal
he interpretation of this growing solution for mCPs.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we con-
sider the Klein-Gordon equation for a running wave and
we reduce it to the Mathieu equation. In sections IIB,
ILC we investigate instability bounds from narrow and
broad resonance, respectively. In Sec. III we investigate
standing wave and compare the result of this section with
experimental constraints. In Sec. [IV we make a conclu-
sion.

II. PARTICLE PRODUCTION IN RUNNING
WAVE WITH k? > 0 BACKGROUND

We consider the production of a charged scalar field
in an external field of a running electromagnetic wave
in a medium, described by the dispersion relation w =
n-!.|k|, where (w, #) is the momentum four-vector, and
n is the medium refraction index. The Lagrangian for
the scalar field reads,

L= Dy Dp — mgd, (1)

where D, = 0, +ieA,. The dynamics of the scalar field
w is governed by the equation of motion, which is the
Klein-Gordon equation,

(G+ 2ie A", — e? A? + m?)W = 0. (2)
Notably, the same equation is obtained in quantum
mechanics (QM) as the relativistic extension of the
Schroedinger equation for the wave function of a charged
scalar particle [42, 43]; the difference is that the QM wave
function should be normalized to unity; there is no such
condition for the scalar field.

We are looking for the solution of eq. (2) using the
following ansatz,

where ¢ = k-«x (here and further, the notation ’. ’ means
the scalar product of four vectors), and p, is an arbitrary
four vector, that satisfies the condition p? = m?. Insert-
ing the ansatz (3) into the equation (2) we obtain the
expression
k?F"() —2ip-kF"($) + (2ep-A—e?A?) F() = 0. (4)
We consider a circularly polarized monochromatic wave,
AY =a" cosé+b’ sing, a-a=b-b<0, (5)
where the momentum k directed along the z-axis; a, =
(0, Zo /w,0,0) and b, = (0,0, £o/w,0) are two constant
space-like orthogonal four-vectors determining the polar-

ization, Ep is the amplitude of the electromagnetic wave.
We introduce the abbreviations:

P 1
bo = arctan(p-b/p-a), C= 5 (0-0). (6)
Using the subsequent ansatz

F(é) = wer [i (SP) ol (7)

we finally reduce the equation of motion (2) to the Math-
ieu equation form, cl. [42, 43]

The Mathieu equation (8) properties and solutions are
well-studied, see e.g. the book [11]. The main property
of the Mathieu equation solution is that depending on

the values of the parameters
riodic (stable) or exponential
corresponding areas of stabi

(Ap, g) the solutions are pe-
ly growing (unstable). The
ity and instability are pre-

sented at the Mathieu equation chart, see Fig. 1. The
instability areas, or the resonant bands, are the stripes
which start for g = 0 at the points A, = N?, N isa
natural number, and grow wider with q.

Depending on the values of A, and q one distinguishes
two regimes of analytical solutions [7]: narrow resonance,
related to the case q < 1, A, ~ 1 (the beginning of the
first resonant band at Fig. 1), and broad resonance (Ap ~
2q > 1); both of them we study below in detail. For
the reason of simplicity, we start from the perturbative
regime which should be the limiting case for the narrow
resonance at q — 0.

A. Perturbative regime.

Perturbatively, a photon of 4-momentum k, =
(w,0,0,nw) decays to a pair of charged massive scalars
of, for simplicity, the same energy and same z-projection
of spatial momentum,

Py ( (=) +m? + pi + D3,

The form (11) satisfies p? = m?. The energy-momentum
conservation implies the value for the perpendicular mo-
mentum for finite particles,

p', is positive for a medium with n < 1 and for a quite
small mass m of a millicharged scalar. Substituting (12)
to (9) we obtain A, = 1. A single initial photon instead
of a classical wave represents the limiting case gq > 0. We
expect that the narrow resonance is an extension of this
process to larger amplitude Eo.

B. Narrow resonance. First resonance band

Now we consider nonzero classical field amplitude Ep.
We keep the condition g < 1. We make the following
dimensionless notations:

cEo =” my = Ps, (13)

ration (11) read,

The boundary between the stable and unstable regions
of the Mathieu chart (Fig.1) is pr, = 0, or

This dependence is shown in Figure 1 by the solid blue
line.

The stability boundary (17) expressed through the
model parameters, see (14) and (15), can be solved with
respect to the perpendicular momentum 7. The numer-
ical solution for 7, as a dependence of the scaled ampli-
tude € is shown in Fig. 2 (numerical value 1 — n? = 0.1
and y = 0 are taken); the unstable region of the per-
pendicular momentum 7, lies between two branches of
the solution. Analytically, for E < val —n? — 4? one
obtains,

ric around the value 79 ; for € = 0.1 this region grows and
becomes asymmetric, in agreement with Fig. 2. The Flo-
quet exponent is almost constant inside the unstable re-
gion but sharply decreases near the boundary. Thus, we
can estimate the Floquet exponent for a certain € with

Now we turn to the analysis of the dependence on the

the instability interval of 7, shifts to the lower values,

small € — 0, so the resonance goes without threshold;
we denote this regime as non-threshold regime. For

related to the perturbative process amplified by Bose en-
hancement. The resonance in the threshold regime can-
not provide a perturbative process which is forbidden due

to the energy-momentum conservation.

C. Broad resonance

Here we consider the opposite limiting case gq > 1
which has an analytical description called broad reso-
nance, see details of the semiclassical interpretation in
[7, 10].

Shortly, the broad resonance occurs if
q>A,/2>1. (21)

The line A, = 2q is shown in Fig. 1 as a black dashed
curve. This boundary condition in terms of dimensionless
physical parameters (13) acquires the following form,

oe 2
(yea pe+n% — 1/2) —E°(1—n?) = 2€m,.
(22)
Fig. 7 shows the boundary of the broad resonance for
different values of ju: the resonance occurs on the right
side of the boundary curve and above the blue dashed
line which corresponds to the broad resonance condition
(q > 1). The broad resonance is always the threshold
one: the minimal necessary value of € is taken for min-
imal perpendicular momentum z'/'*" obtained from the
expression pole = 0. We see that the pp = 0 boundary
related to q ~ 1 near the threshold, so it is safer to study
broad resonance for p = 1.

The threshold character of the broad resonance can
be illustrated by Fig. 8, which shows the dependence of
scaled amplitude € on the scaled mass yp for minimal 1"”
for fixed n? = 0.9. Production of heavier millicharges

requires larger amplitude € of electric field.

D. Towards experimental challenges

In this subsection, we discuss the possibility of the
experimental tests of mCP parameters (e,m) with the
aforementioned resonant process of mCP production in
an intense running wave of electromagnetic field with dis-
ersion k? > 0. We concentrate on possible laboratory
ests for which a metamaterial medium with n < 1 is nec-
essary. The experimental signature of resonant mCP pro-
duction can be provided in two ways: anomalous energy
losses in the present electromagnetic wave or detection of
roduced mCP by another process. Here we adopt the
first approach and neglect for simplicity the back reaction
rocess which becomes relevant after sufficient losses, see
12] for relevant discussion.

A charge e contributes only to parameter €: e = ca Ey
while m = u-w, cl. (13), so the unstable area in terms of

hysical parameters (e, m) is related to the rescaled union

Figure 9. The dependence of charge e on mass m for narrow
and broad resonances and different experimental bounds. The
following notation is used for the experimental constraints: LS
from Lamb shift [46], OP from Ortho-Positronium decay [47],
PVLAS from the PVLAS experiment [48], SN from SN1987A
(37, 39, 49], SZ from CMB observations of the Sunyaev-
Zel'dovich effect [50], RG from red giants [49], VdG and TS
from Van de Graaff and thunderstorms, respectively, for the
mCP condensate [32], PTD from photon time delay with pul-
sars for millicharged Dark Matter [33]. The area above the
dashed blue lines corresponds to the narrow resonance regime,
and the area above the cyan line is the region of the broad
resonance regime. The black dashed line corresponds to the
expression q = l.

of unstable areas of Fig. 6 and Fig. 8. Naively, the non-
threshold regime is related to instability for any small
€. However, even in the non-threshold regime there
is an effective threshold in terms of €; for amplitudes
below that, the rate of the process is too low to produce
anomalous losses. A rude but conservative estimation is
to assume that the millicharge field amplitude grows in
1000 times in a relevant period of time (say 1 second).
Thus, the effective threshold reads,

10° V1 — n?

wt

Ces f-threshold ~ (23)
In the threshold regime of narrow resonance € and so
/4F1 is not so small, so we say that the effective resonance
starts immediately once it is allowed.

Intuitively, the best sensitivity to e is for a small radio
frequency wave. For this reason, we consider a bench-
mark wavelength \ ~ 1 m which corresponds to a fre-
quency w ~ 3 x 10° kHz ~ 2 x 1077 eV. We take the
benchmark value for the amplitude of the electric field
Eo ~ 10kV/m ~ 2.3 x 10-8eV?. The resulting esti-
mations are given in Fig. 9 in comparison with existing
constraints.

Note that the infinite medium in the transverse direc-
tion was considered. The real medium is finite; produced
mCP can leave the medium, stopping the resonance.

The next step is to consider a wave with a larger am-
plitude than previously. Therefore, we now proceed to
analyze a standing wave in a cavity.

Ill. STANDING WAVE

In conjunction with the running wave discussed in the
previous section, we study resonant millicharge particle
production in a standing wave background. A standing
wave in the radio frequency range can have a significantly
larger amplitude than a running wave, as the electromag-
netic energy is coherently accumulated within a closed
volume.

We model the standing wave as a superposition of two
counter-propagating running waves. Electromagnetic po-
tential A, reads,

A" =a" cos¢ + b“ sind + (a cos ¢’ +b sing’), (24)

where ¢=wt —k,z, d' =wt+k,z, and
a;, = (0,—Ep/w,0,0), bj, = (0,0, Zo/w,0). (25)
Solving the Klein-Gordon equation (2) in a background
(24), one makes an ansatz (cf. (3)),
b= P*F(9,8!). (26)
Substituting the ansatz (26) into the equation (2), we
derive

for millicharged Dark Matter [33]. The area above the blue
and cyan lines corresponds to the broad resonance regime for
different values of Ep and minimal 7” | obtained from the

condition we nm" | = 0. The black dashed line corresponds

to the bound m = nw from the antinode condition of a stand-
ing wave

where Pypot = ((p a)? +(p- 8)2)7?, Equation (27) was
divided into two equations after the replacement. One of
these equations is equation (29), and the second one is
exactly the same, but with ¢ replaced by ¢’.

The equation (29) is not the Mathieu equation, unlike
the case of a running wave, due to its dependence on z.
However, if the Compton wavelength of the millicharged
particle is much smaller than the electromagnetic wave-
length (i.e., m >> nw), one can solve equation (29) in the
vicinity of an electric field antinode. By approximating
the first cosine in Eq. (29) as unity, we obtain the Math-
ieu equation (cf. [45]). The case of small mass requires a
more detailed investigation and is not considered in this
work. Introducing ¢) = $(wt — do), one rewrites (29) as

As in the previous section, we use dimensionless pa-
rameters to study the instability boundaries for broad
resonances. The condition for the antinode is p< n =
0.95; therefore, the narrow resonance regime cannot be
considered within this approximation, especially since
the broad resonance regime is more effective for a stand-
ing wave. We obtain the dependencies of € on p for a
fixed € and different values of 7, in the broad resonance
regime, as shown in Fig. 10.

We obtain the dependence e(m) for the standing wave
from the boundaries of the broad resonances (21). This
dependence is shown in Fig. 11 for \ ~ 1 m (correspond-
ing to a frequency w ~ 2 x 10~7eV), the minimal 7,

determined from the condition

ee = 0 and dif-
ferent amplitudes of the electric field Ep ~ 10kV/m ~
2.3 x 10-8 eV? — green line, Ey ~ 1MV/m ~ cyan line,
Eo ~ 100MV/m — blue line. As can be seen from the
figure, our constraints can be lower than the existing ex-
perimental limits for certain values of Ep.

We now estimate the trajectory of the production par-
ticles [45, 51] and the required cavity size such that the
particles are confined and accumulate. For this purpose,
we consider the equation

mi = eEp cos(wt).

The particle trajectory can then be approximated as

pit eK
oe 7 cos(wt),
mu?

m

where the first term describes the transverse size of the
cavity LD = ££, and corresponds to the amplitude of
oscillatory motion. We now estimate this size using the
experimental values from Fig. 11. For w ~ 2 x 10~TeV,
e~ 10-2, Ey ~ 10 eV’, r, = 10-3, m ~ 10° eV and
time t ~ i s the first term gives a contribution on the
order of ~ 0.4 meters, while the second term yields L ~
10-!° meters. We believe that such cavity parameters
are experimentally feasible.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this article, we examine the solution of the Klein-
Gordon equation for scalar electrons with tiny electric
charge in a medium of refractive index n. We reduce
the equations of motion to the Mathieu equation and in-
vestigate the instability of its solution. This is a classical
effect that occurs only for a refractive index n < 1. These
values can be realized in either a plasma or in metama-
terials.

We investigated narrow and broad resonance regimes
and obtained the instability bound for mCP. For the
narrow resonance regime, we considered a model of an
infinity medium, which provides only approximate con-
straints. However, we assume that the result beyond our
model will be close to the boundary found. Consequently,
we can conclude that this effect is only possible for small

masses of the resulting particle, which requires fulfillment
of the condition of dimensionless mass pp << 1. Under this
condition, the sensitivity of the proposed experimenta!
technique to the charge e of mCP does not depend on
its mass m. When this condition is not satisfied, the in-
stability boundary increases abruptly and exceeds tha
of the broad resonance. Therefore, for large masses, we
consider the broad resonance regime. In this regime we
obtained that even for zero dimensionless mass ju there
is no such 7, for which € = 0. Consequently, we can
conclude that for large masses there exists a threshol
value for the electric field amplitude, which depends on
the charge of mCP.

Subsequently, we compared those results with existing
experimental constraints. In total we obtained constraint
that do not overlap with the experimental results in a
limited range of parameters. In order to increase this
range we should increase the amplitude of the electric
field.
Following this, we consider the case of background
ectromagnetic standing wave. We also used known so-
lutions and boundaries of the Mathieu equation. But,
in order to obtain the Mathieu equation, we used the
large mass approximation. Therefore, we cannot con-
sider small masses and narrow resonance regime in this
approximation. Thereafter we investigate different values
of the amplitude of the electric field for broad resonance
regime. As a result, we obtained the better constraint
than for the case of running wave.
The next logical step is to explore fast radio bursts
(FRB) which interact with the plasma that is in its path
of propagation [52, 53]. Moreover, if the observations
reveal unknown energy losses, then this may indicate the
production of millicharged particles. This task we will
consider in future.
