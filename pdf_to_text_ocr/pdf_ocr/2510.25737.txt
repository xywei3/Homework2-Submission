Fluid three-phase equilibria, with phases a, 3, y, are studied close to a tricritical point, analytically
and numerically, in a mean-field density-functional theory with two densities. Employing Griffiths’
scaling for the densities, the interfacial tensions of the wet and nonwet interfaces are analysed. The
mean-field critical exponent is obtained for the vanishing of the critical interfacial tension og, as a
function of the deviation of the noncritical interfacial tension 04+ from its limiting value at a critical
endpoint oa,37. In the wet regime, this exponent is 3/2 as expected. In the nonwetting gap of the
model, the exponent is again 3/2, except for the approach to the critical endpoint on the neutral
line where ag = Gay. When this point is approached along any path with oag # 0+, or along
the neutral line, 734 x |oay — Ga,67|°/4, featuring an anomalous critical exponent 3/4, which is an
exact result derived by analytic calculation and explained by geometrical arguments.

I. INTRODUCTION

Wetting and wetting phase transitions are topics of
evergreen significance in statistical mechanics and be-
yond (for reviews, see [I}{6]). Recently there has been
a revival of interest in predicting wetting phase dia-
grams from density-functional theory for adsorbed fluids
[7]. Primarily two settings have been considered: fluid
wo-phase equilibria at a solid substrate [7}9], and fluid
hree-phase equilibria (without a wall) in which the three
hases are treated on an equal footing [IO}H13]. In the la
er setting, liquid mixtures have been studied near criti-
cal endpoints in the vicinity of a bulk tricritical point.
Both experimentally and theoretically [10) [11]
here is evidence for the existence of a nonwetting gap in
which the standardly expected phenomenon of “critical-
oint wetting” (CPW) does not take place.

iz

The behavior of interfacial tensions near bulk critical
oints, and its interplay with wetting, is a problem of
long-standing interest [[8}21]. Cahn argued that for two
hase-separated fluids adsorbed at a wall, one fluid phase
must wet the interface between the other fluid phase and
he wall, upon approach of a bulk critical point at which
he two fluid phases become a single critical phase [22].
This CPW scenario has been confirmed in various sys-
ems of experimental and theoretical interest [20] [23] 24].
However, the argument in favor of its necessity has re-
eatedly been shown to be circular and counterexamples
o CPW have gradually been receiving unbiased atten-

ion [14] [25}30).

II. TWO-DENSITY DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL
THEORY

Various models of the structure and tension of inter-
faces at fluid three-phase equilibria were studied within
mean-field density-functional theory (DFT) in [31]. Here,
we concentrate on one of these models, akin to model T in
BI], analysed analytically and numerically in [32], taking
into account all the constraints on the densities imposed
by the mean-field theory for tricritical points developed
by Griffiths [33]. The essential ingredients are recalled
for clarity.

For concreteness, a three-component fluid mixture is
considered, for which the three chemical potentials ju;,
i € 1,2,3, together with pressure p and temperature T,
span a 5-dimensional thermodynamic field space with a 4-
dimensional manifold of equilibrium states. Therein, a 2-
dimensional surface of three-phase coexistence of phases
a, 8 and ¥ is studied, bounded by two lines of critical
endpoints (CEP) which meet at a tricritical point (TCP).
At three-phase coexistence, a, 6 and y may meet at a
common line of contact (nonwet state) or one of them,
say 3, may intrude between a and ¥ (wet state) [21]. The
transition between the nonwet and the wet states is the
wetting phase transition.

The (dimensionless) interfacial free-energy density V
of the DFT with two densities p; and p2 is taken to be

W(p1,p2) = 5 1 (*) 4p Il YS (ei- 0%). (1)

i=1,2 v=a,B,y 1=1,2

It is a product of three potential wells, centered on
points in the (1, /p2)-plane, with bulk phase densities
Pv = (p{. ps), with v = a,8,y. The equilibrium den-
sity profiles are those spatially varying densities p;(z)
and p2(z) that minimize the interface free-energy func-
tional f YW dz subject to two bulk boundary conditions,
at |z| > oo. For example, for a at z = —oo and ¥ at
Z=O,

Say= min | W(p1, p2) dz. (2)

If the ay interface is wet by 3, one has
Cay = Tap + O84, (3)
whereas, if 3 does not wet the ay interface, one has
Fay < Fas + OBy- (4)

A simple analytic expression was proposed and veri-
fied numerically for the interfacial tension of a nonwet
interface in this model [32]. It reads

2
Cay = Ve pup (5)

Here P is the length of the ay edge in the three-phase
ay triangle spanned by the bulk phase points in the
(p1, p2)-plane, and ¢ the length of the median connecting
B to the ay edge (see Figure 1 in [32]). The conjecture
was proven to be exact by mathematical solution of
the model [I].

In the Griffiths mean-field theory of tricritical phenom-
ena, linear combinations of the densities, which we re-
name just p; (for the principal density) and p2 (for the
subsidiary density), obey a constraint on the bulk densi-
ties, in each phase, which takes the form

0 = —(p')”, (6)

and the bulk principal densities (for the three phases in
the coexistence region) are the solutions of the third-
degree polynomial

$(p1) = p? — 3tp + 2s. (7)

Here, s and t (> 0) are linear combinations of the thermo-
dynamic field variables j;, p and T’,, such that the TCP
is at s = ¢ = 0 and the three-phase coexistence range for
sis

=P? 2s of. (8)

The two CEP lines in the (s, t)-plane satisfy st~3/? = +1.
They meet tangentially at the TCP in a cusp. Varying
s between —t?/? and t?/? at constant ¢ can, for example,
be thought of as varying pressure p or varying one of the
chemical potentials j1; in order to interpolate between the
two CEPs at constant temperature T.

Ill. INTERFACIAL TENSION IN THE
THREE-PHASE REGION BETWEEN CRITICAL
ENDPOINTS

For the critical interfacial tension close to a CEP at
which 8 and 7 become identical phases, i.e., close to s =

#3/2, an exact calculation was performed in [32], which
implies the following series expansion
16/2
oBy = 15a + t)1/2(1 + 4t)3/268/2
4/3 t7(1 + 4t)1/?

+ OC”), (9)

(—1 + 55¢ + 92t?)65/?

where €(< 1) is a measure of the distance to the CEP in
the manner

sa (le) 8/2. (10)

As noted in [32], since ¢ is linear in the deviation of the
field s from its CEP value, one retrieves the standard
mean-field critical exponent 3/2 for the vanishing of the
interfacial tension at two-phase criticality.

We now turn to the calculation of the general (non-
critical) interfacial tension for a nonwet interface in the
three-phase region of the (s,t)-plane. This can be ob-
tained by direct solution, using (@) and (7). Addition-
ally, in order to gain more insight into the properties
cl o a CEP from analytic results, one may perform
a series expansion in €. The critical exponent describing
the vanishing of the deviation of the interfacial tension,
say Cap, of a nonwet interface from its value Fa,py at
the Gy CEP was found to take the value 1 under general
circumstances,

Cap — Faby x €+ O(e8/?). (11)

In the following this result is checked in the various re-
gions of the wetting phase diagram uncovered in [10].
If holds true, then together with it implies the
generic relationship between the interfacial tensions of
the nonwet interfaces,

op X [Fag — Fa,41?- (12)

This critical-endpoint exponent 3/2 is expected in mean-
field theory.

A. Wet states close to the TCP

In this subsection, states in which the ay interface is
wet by 3 are examined. According to the wetting phase
diagram obtained in [10], such states occur close to the
TCP and a sufficient condition for wet states to span
the entire range between the two CEPs at constant ¢ is
t < 2//3—1 ~ 0.1547. The states satisfy hp. Direct
calculation confirms that holds close to the CEP.

For t = 0.1 Fig] displays the interrelationship of the
interfacial tensions o,g and ogy. The generic law (12)
holds. It is also shown that the wetting condition
satisfied.

of the ay interface that is wet by 6, versus gag for a sweep
(varying s) between the two CEPs at t = 0.1. In this regime
close to the TCP, only wet states are encountered and CPW
holds. Note that the plot of og, is convex towards the ori-
gin as was found experimentally in a specific fluid mixture
[20]. The three-fluid interface configurations asymptotically
close to the CEPs, on the edge of three-phase coexistence,
are drawn in the diagrams. In these diagrams, the solid line
represents the non-critical interface and the dashed line the
diffuse near-critical interface.

B. Nonwet states inside the nonwetting gap

The nonwetting gap, in which CPW is absent, extends
in this model from t = (7 — V3)/8 = 0.1569 to t =
(7 + V3)/8 = 1.5930. As representative examples the
results are shown of interpolating between the two CEPs
at t = 0.25 and between the two CEPs at t = 1.

For t = 0.25 Figp2| displays the interrelationship of the
interfacial tensions og and ogy. The generic law (12)
holds, and it also holds when ogg is replaced by day.
Note that all states between the a3 CEP and the By
CEP are nonwet, since holds throughout.

For t = 1 Fig]3| likewise displays gg and og,. The
generic law olds, and it also holds when gag is
replaced by oq. The nonwetting condition satisfied
along the entire sweep between the a8 CEP and the By
CEP. Note that the plot of ag, is now mostly concave
towards the origin instead of convex as in Fig{]]

An interesting exception is found at the CEP that co-
incides with the endpoint of a neutral line (on which two
interfacial tensions are equal). There are two such cases,
related by symmetry, both occurring for t = 1/2. They
represent a surprising critical exponent anomaly, which
was succinctly announced in [32]. The next subsection is

gin, and on this scale appears to be almost linear. However,
asymptotically close to the CEPs ogy approaches the axes
tangentially, and features the exponent 3/2 in accord with
(12). The three-fluid interface configurations asymptotically
close to the CEPs, on the edge of three-phase coexistence,

C. Critical exponent anomaly at the neutral point
in the nonwetting gap

When the neutral point, with ong = 7a), on the By
CEP line, at t = 1/2, is approached from the three-phase
region (see Fig.2 in [10]), along any direction in the (s, t)-
plane, the generic law ) breaks down, and instead one
finds, for s > 0,

This anomalous law is valid for an arbitrary trajectory
in the (s,t)-plane, with ogg # cay, terminating on the
CEPs at ¢ = 1/2. The law is also valid for the special
trajectory that follows the neutral line. Fig] presents
the interfacial tensions for a sweep at constant t = 1/2.

since day < Gag + og, only nonwetting states are encoun-
tered and CPW is absent. The CEPs lie in the nonwetting
gap. Note that various interfacial tensions have become multi-
valued near the 6y CEP, when plotted as a function of aa,
while they are single-valued functions of s (not shown here).
The point where all three interfacial tensions intersect is the
fully symmetric configuration with all three dihedral angles
equal to 27/3. Note that the plot of og, is mostly con-
cave towards the origin, except very close to the CEPs where,
once again, ogy approaches the axes tangentially (not visible
on this scale), and features the exponent 3/2 in accord with

close to the CEPs, on the edge of three-phase coexistence,

diffuse near-critical interface. Note that the asymptotic state
is nonwet, with asymptotic contact angle 6 = 2.54 rad in ac-
cord with the exact results derived in [10].

Ba — Py = (—2y/ 2el/?t1/?, dy /2e!/?4) + O(€9/2) (21)

and the scalar product is given by

(Ba — Hes) (Bs —2y) = 6/2 #(1-24) e/? +O(€*/?) (22)

The next term in (19) features the asymptotic contact

angle B between the a@ and the By interfaces infinitesi-
mally close to the CEP line for (+ criticality. The ana-
lytic expression for cos B is given in [10].

The anomaly can now be explained using geomet-
rical arguments. The first term on the r.hs. of
ertains to the geometry of the three-phase triangle in
he (pi, /p2)-plane, in the vicinity of a CEP. It is zero
when the triangle is isosceles, since the vector connecting
a@ with the 6 y CEP is then perpendicular to the vector
connecting the phase points 6 and 7 that bifurcate from
By. It is negative otherwise and its contribution is of
first order in the thermodynamic field deviation € away
from the CEP. This signifies that in linear response, the
interfacial tension deviation og, —7a,g+ is zero at t = 1/2
where the line of CEPs intersects the neutral line. We
conclude that a geometrical argument can explain the
vanishing of the coefficient of € for t = 1/2 in the first
term on the r.h.s. of (18).

The second term on the r.h.s. of (19) pertains to the
geometry of the Neumann triangle [21], which represents
he triangle inequalities, suc! , among the three
interfacial tensions. Its edges are proportional to the in-
erfacial tensions and its shortest edge is proportional to
he critical interfacial tension og . In the vicinity of a
CEP, where og, is of order 63/2, the term under con-
sideration vanishes when the asymptotic contact angle
akes the value 8 = 1/2. Infinitesimally close to the CEP
ine, this happens when the Neumann triangle is isosce-
es, implying the symmetry ag = 0a, that characterises
he neutral line. Again, the intersection of the CEP line
with the neutral line singles out the value t = 1/2, for
which the coefficient of €°/? vanishes in the second term
on the r.h.s. of (18).

In sum, one is left with an interfacial tension deviation
of order €? in place of €, with v = B or ¥,

On the other hand, the critical interfacial tension close
to the CEP has, from (9), the following expansion,

We conclude that the anomaly takes the following explicit

IV. CONCLUSION AND AN EXPERIMENTAL
PERSPECTIVE

In fluid three-phase equilibria (with phases a, 3,7)

fluid-fluid interfacial tensions 7 have been studied in the
vicinity of lines of critical endpoints that meet at a tri-
critical point in a mean-field density functional theory.
Special attention has been paid to the behavior of oa
and og, as functions of ogg (at fixed temperature) in
the three-phase coexistence region between the af and
By critical endpoints. The generic and expected law de-
scribing the vanishing of the critical interfacial tension
as a function of the difference between the noncritical
interfacial tension and its critical-endpoint value, has,
with one notable exception, been verified to hold with
the (mean-field) critical exponent 3/2.
The exponent 3/2 has been confirmed for the segment
of the CEP for which CPW occurs, as well as for the most
part of the segment of the CEP for which CPW is absent
and a nonwetting gap exists. However, an intriguing ex-
ception is found for one 8y CEP in the nonwetting gap
where the neutral line g4g = oa, meets the CEP line.
When that CEP is approached along any path, which
need not coincide with the neutral line, the mean-field
exponent takes the value 3/4. This value is obtained
exactly from analytic calculation and is explained, us-
ing geometrical arguments, to be the consequence of the
simultaneous vanishing of two coefficients in the series
expansion of the noncritical interfacial tension about the
CEP. One coefficient vanishes because the three-phase
triangle in the density plane becomes isosceles asymptot-
ically close to the CEP and the other vanishes because
the Neumann triangle becomes asymptotically isosceles
around its shortest edge o,.

Concerning the experimental relevance of the theoret-
ical results described here, a number of remarks are in
order. The Kahlweit-Busse and Aratono-Kahlweit exper-
iments on phase-segregated oil, water and non-ionic am-
phiphile mixtures stated that, for a specific choice of mix-
ture, no nonwetting to wetting transition was detected
upon approaching either one of the two CEPs [14] [5].
Indeed, near both CEPs for H2O-n-octane-CgE4, and
near the lower CEP for H2O-n-octane-CgE3, detailed

lose to 7/2 [15], instead of 0 or 7 expected for the CPW

data suggested that the asymptotic contact angles are

or H2O-n-octane-Cs5Eg, their de-
play wetting transitions well before
illustrating CPW.

Soon after these findings, however, an Erratum ap-

peared in which Ara

ono and Kahlweit withdrew their

statement concerning the possible persistence of nonwet-
ting for H,O-n-octane-CgE4 and H2O-n-octane-C¢E3,
subsequent to finding a systematic error in the experi-
ment. They announced revised experiments and added
that they “regret any irritation that our erroneous state-
ment may have caused among theorists” [16]. Results
from the later experiments on the same mixtures H2O-
n-octane-CgE, and H2O-n-octane-CgE3 indicated that

the contact angles approaching the CEPs appear to be
vanishing, which could still be consistent with a wetting
transition, but perhaps too close to the CEP to be de-
tectable [17].

Clearly, experiments on these mixtures, or variants
thereof, merit revisiting in the light of the possible consis-
tency between experiment and the theoretical prediction
of a nonwetting gap from exact solution of a DFT {10} {17].
