We observe and model spin currents arising from chirality and effective spin-exchange interactions
in a weakly interacting °Li Fermi gas. Chirality is introduced by a static displacement between the
center of the trapped atoms and the center of an applied magnetic bowl, which produces spatially
varying spin rotation. Spin-selective spin current is observed via oscillations in the centers of mass of
the spin-up and spin-down components, which appear to bounce off of or pass through one another,
depending on the relative size of the chirality and s-wave spin scattering interactions. We show that
this behavior obeys a driven oscillator equation with an effective spin-dependent driving force.

Chiral or twisted materials are of great interest for
generating and controlling spin-polarized electron cur-
rents [1] to enable “spintronics” technologies. In such
technologies, information is transmitted via spin currents
instead of electron currents, greatly reducing Joule heat-
ing, which limits the scalability of computers. Chiral
molecules [2] can act as passive spin filters, efficiently
transporting electrons for one polarization while imped-
ing the transmission of the other. Large chiral-induced
spin selectivity (CISS) has been observed in the asym-
metric transmission of polarized electrons through thin
films of chiral molecules, including DNA [3, 4]. While
spin-orbit coupling is known to play a role in this ef
fect, no unifying theory of the role of chirality has been
able to quantitatively reproduce measurements. Spin
transport in chiral materials is now widely studied [5-8
for manipulating spin-selective spin currents. Ultracold
Fermi gases provide experimental simulators for spintron-
ics concepts [9], which may offer new insights into chiral
control methods.

We report on the measurement of chirality-induce'
spin currents in a trapped, weakly interacting Fermi gas
of ®Li atoms, confined in the combined potential of a
cigar-shaped COz laser trap and a magnetic bowl, Fig. 1.
A chiral spin texture (i.e., a spin spiral/twist) is create
by simply displacing the center of the laser trap from the
center of the magnetic bowl, which causes the coherently
prepared spin medium to evolve into a twisted state. We
show that the observed spin-selective spin current obeys
a 1D driven oscillator equation, with an effective spin-
dependent driving force that arises from s-wave scatter-
ing in the twisted medium.

The °Li atoms are initially prepared in a z-polarized
spin state |t). A short 7/2 rf pulse then creates a
pseudospin state, which we define to be x-polarized,

fine states, in order of increasing energy. A bias magnetic
field B, (orthogonal to the trap axis x) both defines the
quantization axis and controls spin-spin interactions by
tuning the |*)-|{) s-wave scattering length a,. Key to
the experiments is the curvature of B.(a), which creates
a spin-dependent harmonic potential (i.e., a magnetic
bowl) that confines the cloud along the a-axis, with neg-
ligible effect in the narrow transverse directions y, z. The
COz laser potential provides radial confinement and has

cigar-shaped cloud of °Li (light blue), prepared in a super-
position of spin-up and spin-down states, is confined by a
focused COz laser beam (orange) and a magnetic bowl (red).

a spin-independent axial force that is comparable to that
of the magnetic bowl. The center of the magnetic bowl is
determined by fixed electromagnets, while the COz laser
focal point is easily translated to shift the center of the
trapped atoms relative to that of the magnetic bowl.

ference in the harmonic oscillation frequencies for the two
states [10]. Note that the small value of dw, /wo is due
to the fact that the two states differ only in nuclear spin
projection. The average potential is spin-independent
and centered at x = 0. Chirality is controlled by 2s,
the offset between the measured centers of the magnetic
bowl and the trapped cloud, as we now discuss.

For our experiments, where 25 ~ 0, ~ 200m, we find
w+ — x, ~ 0.2m, which is negligible compared to the
cloud widths. This is consistent with our observations
that there is no difference in the position of the cloud
whether it is prepared in the |t) state or the ||) state.
Hence, we expect that the difference between the me-
chanical forces does not play a role in the evolution of
the system. However, the spatially varying frequency
shift (V; — V,)/h produces a spatially varying rotation
rate of the pseudospins about the chiral z-axis

in a frame rotating at the hyperfine resonance frequency,
creating a twisted spin state as the system evolves [11].
Just after the 7/2 pulse, all of the spins are parallel
and hence non-interacting in a Fermi gas restricted to
s-wave scattering. The initial evolution of the pseudo-
spins is then governed by the x-dependent rotation rate
Q, causing the spin vectors to point in different directions
at a later time, enabling scattering interactions between
the atoms. In the weakly interacting regime, the atoms
remain in simple harmonic motion, but forward s-wave
scattering causes identical spin rotation (ISRE) [12, 13].
ISRE is analogous to a spin-exchange interaction, where
each spin in a colliding pair rotates about the resultant
spin vector, producing a measurable spin z component.
We investigate the interplay between the interaction
strength, controlled by the s-wave scattering length as,
and the chirality, controlled by the offset 2... Asymmet-
ric spatial profiles are observed for nonzero static dis-
placements x,,, as shown in Fig. 2. The experiments
are performed in the nondegenerate regime, where the
reduced temperature 0.5 < T/Tp < 0.7. The profiles
of both spin states are identical immediately after the rf
pulse and nominally gaussian, centered at 2 = 0 with a
1/e width o,. Fig. 2(a) shows the results obtained for
os = 1.00, with o, = 198 jm at B = 511 G, where the
s-wave scattering length a, = —53.lao9, the peak total

density 79 = 0.90/jum* (see below), and the trap fre-
quency 4%, = 25.9 Hz. At t = 21 ms after the 7/2 rf
pulse (about half of the trap period), the spin-up profile
(blue) is shifted to the right, while spin-down profile (red)
is shifted left. Fig. 2(b) shows the results obtained for
negative a, = —0.90, with o, = 195 um at B = 437 G,
where a, = —213.1ao, Mo = 0.52/pm’, and v, = 24.3 Hz.
At t = 37 ms, the profile of the spin-up (blue) is shifted
to the left, while that of the spin-down component (red)
is distorted on the left and shifted right. In both cases,
the total spin density n(x) = n+(a,t) + ny(z,t) is time-
independent and remains a gaussian centered at « = 0
(orange), demonstrating spin current without total den-
sity (charge) current. Solid curves show the predictions
of the model, discussed below.

We quantify the effect of chirality on the motion by
plotting the center-of-mass (x)+,) = f dxxny,(x,t)/Npy
for each state versus time, for different offsets 2,. Fig. 3
shows data for 2, of 0.80,,0,—0.802, and —3¢, at 511

the evolution resembles Newton’s cradle: the spin-up and

spin-down profiles separate, return to the center, and ap-
pear to bounce off of one another, exhibiting out-of-phase
spin dipole modes. The directions of motion of the spins
are interchanged when the sign of x, is reversed, Fig. 3
(a,c). For x, = 0, Fig. 3(b), there is no separation in
the centers-of-mass of the two states. This position lo-
cates the center of the magnetic bowl. For 1, = —30x,
Fig. 3(d), the spin-up and spin-down profiles oscillate
completely through one another. In all cases, the oscil-
lation slowly decays, persisting more than 0.5 s [14]. We
see that the centers-of-mass oscillate 180° out of phase,
with an envelope dependent on as, peak density rig (see
below), trap frequency 1, and offset 295.

The bouncing behavior observed for |xs| ox is
closely related to the symmetrical spin-segregation that
occurs at % 5 = 0 [15, 16]. For this case, spin-up atoms
appear to move to the center of the trap, spin-down
atoms appear to move to the edges, reversing roles with
he sign of the scattering length. For large enough as,
he spins oscillate between segregated and unsegregated
spatial profiles without changing the roles of the spins,
appearing to “bounce” off of one another. For a negligi-
ble energy-changing collision rate, atoms remain in fixed
energy states, allowing an energy-space picture, where
(Q) x (x?) x E for zo; = 0 from eq. 3. This produces
chirality in energy space, resulting in spin states that
are correlated with both the energy and the spatial pro-
files [17-23]. For nonzero «os, the spin-energy correlation
is broken, requiring a real space treatment.

We employ a simplified 1D mean field model [14] of the
oscillating spin profiles in the nearly collisionless, weakly

e neglected for the measurement time scale. The Heisen-
erg equations of motion are used to determine the
evolution of the spin density components sz, 5,,5, and
he corresponding spin currents J,,Jy,J, in a one di-
mensional approximation, where each current component
ows along the x axis [24]. For our experimental param-
eters, forces arising from spatial derivatives of the mean
field potential are negligible and the difference in the
magnetic forces is also negligible, as expected from the
above discussion. In this case, the evolution equation for
he total density shows that n(x, t) = n+(z,t)+n,(a,t) =
no(x) is time-independent, as observed in the experi-
ments. With these approximations and assuming a local
Maxwell-Boltzmann momentum distribution at temper-
ature T, we find that the spin density s(x, t) and current
JI(x,t) obey

In eqs. 4 and 5, 2 (eq. 3) produces twist and s x J,
describing mean field rotation about s, is spin selective.

To model the evolution after the initial 7/2 radio-
frequency pulse, we take the only non-vanishing initial

condition for the pseudo-spin density to be s,.(x,0) =
$no(), where no(z) = Mo exp(—a?/o2). The one-
dimensional approximation implies that the strength of
che s x J interaction term, which is proportional to the
square of the density, should be averaged over the trans-
verse dimensions. To fit the data, we find that the aver-
age peak 3D density fig lies between to no /2, as expected
or a gaussian distribution, and no, the peak 3D den-
sity. Numerical solution determines the spin density pro-
files, ny(a,t) = $no(x) + s.(x,t), which requires that
(x), = —(x)+, as predicted previously [25] and observed
in our experiments.
The model employs the calculated magnetic field tun-
ing rate for the two states and the measured oscillation
requency of atoms in the magnetic bowl to determine
Q [10]. The s-wave scattering lengths at each magnetic
field are calculated from the online data of ref. [26]. The
peak density no is calculated from the total atom num-
ber and the measured cloud profile. We vary the effective
density Mo in the model to obtain the fits shown [14].
The z-components of eqs. 4 and 5 show that the centers
of mass obey driven oscillator equations [14],

In summary, we have measured chirality-induced spin
current in a coherently prepared weakly interacting Fermi

gas that evolves into a twisted medium. The vanishing of
s-wave scattering for parallel spins, according
principle, makes the spin-twisted medium spin orienting.
Although the difference between the spin-dependent me-
chanical forces is negligible, spatially asymmetric spin
waves appear as oscillations in the centers of mass of
the spin components, which are driven by effective spin-
dependent forces. The resulting spin selectivity for spin-
up and spin-down atoms provides a cold gas version o:
the CISS effect in chiral materials.

Appendix A: Supplemental Material

In this supplemental material, we describe a simplified one dimensional model of a twisted weakly interacting Fermi
gas and show that the centers of mass for each spin component obey a driven harmonic oscillator equation, where the
effective driving force is spin-dependent. We tabulate the fit parameters used to model the data.

1. Mean-Field Model of a Twisted Fermi Gas

Mean field models appropriate for weakly interacting Bose and Fermi gases have been developed by several
groups [12, 15, 25, 27-29]. Our interest is in the nearly collisionless regime, where the density and s-wave scattering
length are sufficiently small that energy changing collision rate is negligible for the observation period [13, 16, 17, 19].
Here, we summarize a simplified 1D model of a weakly interacting Fermi gas tailored to our experiments, which
employ a harmonically trapped, coherently prepared sample. In our experiments, a spatially varying spin rotation
rate is introduced by a static displacement between the center of a spin-dependent magnetic potential and the center
of a spin-independent average potential, where the atoms are trapped. S-wave scattering in the resulting spin twisted
medium produces spontaneously oscillating spin waves and corresponding spin-currents, similar to those predicted for
a spin spiral state [25]. We directly observe the oscillation in the motion of the centers of mass of each spin component,
which we show obey a driven oscillator equation with a spin-dependent effective driving force.

Here, the a? term is the average optical and magnetic axial potential, which is spin-independent and centered at

has a negligible effect on the transverse potential, where w, = 27v, with v, ~ 625 Hz the transverse oscillation
frequency. The spin-dependent potential arises only from the magnetic bowl, which is centered at %mag. We define
Los = Lmag — Fmech as the distance between the measured centers of the magnetic bowl and the trapped cloud. The
spin dependent potential arises from the difference between the magnetic tuning rates for the two states and is given in

where the bar denotes a thermal average, 7,(x’) = (hi (x’)o(x’)), Poor (x!) = (Wh(x!)y)o/(x!)). Later, we restore

the time-dependence to the thermal average factors, to be consistent with the thermal averaged Heisenberg picture

To find the evolution equation for the current densities, we multiply eq. $15 by p/m and integrate over p. We
assume that the momentum distribution remains close to thermal equilibrium and is nearly isotropic, so that (p?)

where the signs + and the y argument in C’” correspond to the argument x4 of the first factor for each term in

The / = 0 terms in eq. $23 are proportional to Jaq’. For the 1 = 1 terms, integration by parts removes the p factor,
yielding contributions proportional to gradients of the density matrix. For | > 2, the integrals vanish.

We find the evolution equations for py, and py from eq. $18. Using eqs. $19 and $23, it is straightforward to find
the evolution equations for J;, and J};. By interchanging + and |, these results determine the evolution equations

and similarly for the components of the spin current tensor J;, Jy, and J,.

We write the evolution equations in a frame rotating about the z-axis at the hyperfine resonance frequency, w,. In
this frame, eq. $16 requires Q, + 2. = —Q)} with Q. = ¢[V; (x) —Vj(x)] determined from eq. $2 and 24 = Qy, = 0.
Then, the spin density components s; = (8x, 8y,8z) obey

where the spatially varying rotation rate is

Now we use eq. $19 to explicitly write the evolution equations for the current densities J; in eq. $25, which enables
a clear discussion of the negligible contributions. The x-component of the current density tensor obeys

The evolution equation for the total density 7 = n+ nm, is needed to complete the evolution equations. With

A+V-In =0. ($33)

The current density obeys

where

iin = a (* - “) ; (S35)

Using eq. $34, it is easy to show that the density profile n(x) is time-independent, as observed in our experiments.
First, the differences between the spin-up and spin-down forces is negligible for our experimental parameters, as noted
in the main text. Further, just after the 1/2 radiofrequency pulse is applied, s, = 7/2 is the only nonvanishing
spin density component, so that see = 0 in eq. $35. Hence, the right hand side of eq. $34 initially vanishes. In
thermal equilibrium, we expect that the total density is determined by the balance of the pressure p and trap forces,
Vp+Fn=0. With F = (F;+F,)/2 the average force and the pressure p = nm(v?), the sum of the second and third
terms on the left side of eq. $34 also vanish. Then both J, =Oand J, =0 just after the 7/2 pulse, so that n = 0 for
all t. In modeling the data, we find that spatial derivatives of the mean field potential are negligible, i.e., the second
terms on the right hand side of eqs. $28, S30, and $32 are negligible. Further, the force difference term on the right
hand side of eq. $31 is negligible.

b. One-Dimensional Approximation

As our experiments are performed in a cigar-shaped trap oriented along the x-axis with w, ~ 25wo, we simplify
the description further by making a one-dimensional approximation, using transverse-averaged densities and currents
that depend only on x, and the average force near the cloud center is F), = —muee. We take V > 0, in the evolution
equations and define a spin current density vector J = (J,, Jy, Jz), where the vector denotes the direction of the spin
component carried by the current flowing along x. Assuming a near equilibrium momentum distribution as discussed
above, we take (p?/3) = (p?) = mkpT, where T is the effective temperature. Dropping spatial derivatives of the
mean field potential and force difference terms as discussed above, we obtain the simplified 1D evolution equations,

§+0,J=Q2*xs, (S36)

J4 fet a atubes Qx I Smite sx J, (S37)
where 22 is given by eq. $26.

To model the evolution after the entat m/2 radio-frequency pulse, we take the only non-vanishing initial condition
for the spin density to be s,(x,0) = 3 no(x). For simplicity, we fit the density profile with no(x) = mo exp(—a?/o2),
which defines the effective fempenmnans kpgT = mupoz/2= = (p?/m). The one-dimensional approximation implies that
the strength of the s x J interaction term, which is proportional to the square of the density, should be averaged
over the transverse dimensions. For this reason, we take io AY be a transverse averaged peak 3D density. Numerical

integration determines the spin density profiles n+, (x,t) = 5 5 N(x) + + s,(x,t) and the corresponding centers of mass

where
Ny = (S39)
Eq. $38 shows that (x); = —(«)+ for a 50-50 mixture, as predicted previously [25] and observed in our experiments.

c. Center of Mass Oscillation

Using eqs. $36, S37 and $38, it is easy to show that (x);, obeys a driven oscillator equation. ne z-component
of eq. $36 requires 8, + 0, J, = 0. Multiplying by x and integrating by parts we obtain N+0;(x); = f dx J, and
N40? (x)+ = f dx J,. Integrating the z-component of eq. $37 and using eq. $38 then shows that the center of mass
of the spin-up component obeys a driven harmonic oscillator equation with a spin-dependent driving force, which
changes sign for the spin-down component,

To characterize the relative strength of the chirality and the scattering interactions, we rewrite the spatially varying

We find by numerical integration of eqs. $36 and $37 that the driving term fda (s x J), in eq. $40 generally has a

the rapid increase in the spread in rotation angles for atoms of different energies. For negative xo, atoms moving

to sinusoidal oscillation, Fig. $2. We observe that the oscillation period is close to the trap period 1/v, = 45.8 ms,

and persists for times scales of 0.5 s with a slow decay, which we do not model.

d. Model Fit Parameters

In the fits using the 1D model, we initially estimate the radially averaged 3D density from the peak 3D density

for the
width,

assumed gaussian spatial profile, no = N/(1°/?0,02), where N is the total atom number, a, is the axial 1/e
and o,. is the transverse 1/e radius. We estimate o, = 0, V;,/V;, where vz is the axial oscillation frequency.
12

With a transverse oscillation frequency v, = 625 Hz, we find that no ~ 1/pm3 in all cases. Then we choose mg in
the range from ng/2 and ng to obtain the fits shown. The predictions are quite sensitive to the axial trap frequency,
which is adjusted to optimize the fit. In Table I, we summarize the fit parameters used to obtain the predictions
shown in the figures in the main text.
