A common method for reading out the state of a spin qubit is by latching one logical qubit state,
either |1) or |0), onto a different, metastable charge state. Such a latched state can provide a superior
charge sensing signal for qubit readout, and it can have a lifetime chosen to be long enough that
the charge sensed readout can be high fidelity. However, the passive reset out of latched states is
inherently long, which is not desirable. In this work, we demonstrate an on-demand, high fidelity
(> 99%) re-initialization of a quantum dot qubit out of a latched readout state. The method is
simple to apply as it involves a single baseband voltage pulse to a specific region in the quantum
dot stability diagram where the relaxation time from the latched state to the ground state is over
50 times faster. We describe the mechanism for the reset process as well as the boundaries for the
optimal reset region in the qubit gate voltage space.

I. INTRODUCTION

Latched readout is an important technique for qubit
readout in quantum dots that maps a qubit state, ei-
ther |1) or |0), onto a third, metastable state, called the
latched state [1-3]. It offers two major advantages over
non-latching, spin-to-charge conversion readout schemes:
first, the latched state involves a reservoir transition, in-
ducing a change in total charge occupation, and it thus
generates a larger, more easily measured readout sig-
nal [4-12]. Second, the lifetime of the latched state can
be controlled by tuning the tunnel rates of the system.
This feature is especially useful for systems in which the
relaxation rate of the qubit is much faster than the read-
out bandwidth of the measurement circuit [13-18].

Latched states with a lifetime sufficient for measure-
ment, however, will have a slow natural reset rate that
inherently leads to long qubit re-initialization times, as
described in [19]. Long initialization times not only dras-
ically increase measurement times in qubit experiments,
ut they can also be highly detrimental to quantum er-
ror correction (QEC). For example, a measurement error
rate budget of 0.5% has been proposed for practical im-
lementations of QEC [20]. To achieve this threshold for
oth measurement and initialization without an active
reset, the latch natural decay must be slow compared to
he measurement time, making the re-initialization time
orders of magnitude longer than the minimum measure-
ment time. This is not desirable because all other qubits
waiting during this time will be prone to idling errors. An
active reset would mitigate these errors by re-initializing
he qubit out of the latched state quickly, on-demand,
and with high fidelity. Further, since readout and idling
errors contribute to the overall error budget, reducing
hose errors eases those requirements for other contribu-
ions to the error budget, such as gate errors [21].

In this work we demonstrate on-demand re-
initialization of a quantum dot hybrid qubit (QDHQ)
[22] out of a latched state using only baseband pulses.
The active reset works by pulsing to a region in voltage
space where the latched state quickly decays to the qubit
ground state through a fast two-step process. The latch
we employ is the 4-electron (3,1) state, which differs by
an entire electron charge from the non-latched readout
states (4,1) and (3,2). The active reset method proceeds
in two steps: first, the (3,1) latched state quickly decays
to a (3,2) charge state via a reservoir transition at a
rate of Ip, which is tuned to be fast. Then, an inelastic
tunneling event brings the (3,2) charge state of the
qubit to (4,1),, the qubit |0), completing the qubit re-
initialization. This step occurs at a rate of 1/T;, which
can also be tuned to be fast via the interdot barrier
gate. We demonstrate that this procedure produces
on-demand re-initialization of the qubit at a rate that is
more than 50 times faster than the natural decay of the
latched state, achieving > 99.5% initialization fidelity
within 4 js. We also describe the physical processes in
the surrounding neighborhood of the optimal latch reset
region, and demonstrate why those regions should be
avoided for fast and effective reset.

Fig. lb reports a stability diagram showing the
(Npi,Np2) — (4,1)-(3,2) charge configuration, which
hosts the |0) and |1) states of the 5-electron QDHQ, as
shown in Fig. lc. The 2-electron energy splitting of the
right dot, Egr, is a valley-like singlet-triplet splitting. In
contrast, because there are two additional electrons in the
left dot, which do not participate in the qubit dynamics,
he lowest 4-electron energy splitting of the left dot is an
orbital-like singlet-triplet splitting E*,, [25]. In order to
enter the (3,1) latched state from the (3,2), state in the
readout window, the right dot tunnel rate [rz must be
uned to be faster than the interdot relaxation rate 1/T;,
so that an electron tunnels out of the right dot into the
right lead before an inelastic tunneling event relaxes the
double dot from (3, 2) to (4,1), as shown in Fig. lc. The
ifetime of the latched state is then tunable with the left
dot tunnel rate ;, which controls how long it takes for
an electron to load onto the left dot from the left lead,

re-initializing the qubit to the (4,1) ground state [19].
For these experiments, the lifetime of the latched state
was tuned to the range of 50 — 85 pus.

To confirm the readout is set to latch properly, we
apply the voltage pulse shown in the inset of Fig. 1b.
This pulse, which follows the path shown by the black ar-
rows on the energy dispersion diagram in Fig. lc and the
points on the stability diagram in Fig. lb (R > O- 1),
populates the (3,2), state when the pulse abruptly re-
turns across the polarization line. The readout win-
dow is then visible in the stability diagram shown in
Fig. 1b as the dark triangular region labeled I/R (initial-
ization/readout). It appears as a darker shade of gray,
closer to that of the (3,1) region, because the latching
state (3,1) is occupied for a significant fraction of the
time in the readout window.

The natural reset out of the latched state is very slow,
which we now demonstrate by applying the same pulse
shown in the inset of Fig. 1b at point I/R and monitoring
the charge sensor current using the cryogenic amplifier.
We extract both latching events and unlatching events
using single-shot readout (see Appendix A for measure-
ment details). Fig. 1d shows the resulting distribution
of lifetimes for ~ 3000 latching events with a character-
istic lifetime of 85s. The blue region corresponds to
duration times less than or of order the readout circuit
bandwidth, 1/Af, where few unlatching events can be
observed. The unlatching counts contained in the green
region corresponds to the number of latching events that
successfully unlatched, Nuniatchea, up to a time t. The
unlatching counts contained in the red region then cor-
respond to the number of latching events that failed to
unlatch within t. We plot in the inset the cumulative
number of unlatching events up to a time t, making it
clear that t must get very large before the cumulative
unlatching distribution plateaus. This long tail of un-
latching events lasting hundreds of microseconds, visible
in both the main panel and the cumulative distribution
shown in the inset, motivates the need for an on-demand
reset out of the latched state.

Ill. ON-DEMAND, ACTIVE RESET OF
LATCHED READOUT

We now show that a baseband voltage pulse provides
an on-demand reset by positioning the qubit at an appro-
priate location in gate-voltage space. Fig. 2a illustrates
the energy level manipulations for the active reset pro-
cess corresponding to the gate voltage pulse shown in the
inset of Fig. 2b. After applying the latching pulse and
waiting twait = 5s, long enough to observe the latch-
ing signal, we apply an active reset pulse that ramps the
latched state to a point in voltage space where rapid un-
latching occurs. By waiting at that location for a time
tawell; the latched state resets far more quickly than the
natural latch lifetime.

To identify the proper location for active reset, we plot
in Fig. 2c the probability P(4,1) of returning to a (4,1)
state as a function of the position in gate voltage space
of the reset pulse. For reference, this color plot is super-
imposed on a gray scale plot showing a stability diagram
acquired in the presence of the latching pulse from Fig. 1b
with tawen = 2s and tmeas = 7.5 us, with the readout
point shown in light blue and labeled R. P(4, 1) is clearly
maximized near the dark blue point, corresponding to the
optimum reset point.

point the rate of change significantly increases (black dashed

quickly, and with high fidelity.

Figure 2b reports in blue the unlatching counts for
measurements including the active reset pulse at the lo-
cation of the dark blue circle in Fig. 2c, revealing a very
rapid reset out of the latch. For comparison, the cor-
responding distribution without the active reset pulse is
also shown and labeled as a passive reset, revealing the
expected slower re-initialization from the natural decay
of the latched state.

To demonstrate that the active reset can achieve high
fidelity, we report as the blue curve in Fig. 2d the prob-
ability P(4,1) as a function of the time tawe that the
system sits at the optimal active reset point. This curve
represents the reset fidelity for tmeas = 11.58, which
rises to 99.5% within 4 jus.

We now describe the mechanism for the active reset.
The active reset in the high-fidelity region occurs through
the two-step process shown in Fig. 2a. This high-fidelity
region is bounded on the left by the extended P2 transi-
tion line, shown as the black dashed line in Fig. 2c. To
the right of that line, the (3,1) latching state is higher
in energy than (3,2), and (3,2), enabling an electron to
load quickly onto the P2 dot from the right reservoir at
arate of Ir, which has already been tuned to be fast, as
required for latched readout. In this device, the right dot
ST splitting Esp < 16 eV, is quite small, making both
the (3,2), and (3,2), states energetically accessible. Af-
ter the system transitions out of the (3,1) latching state
into (3,2), an inelastic tunneling event returns the system
to (4, 1),, completing the re-initialization through this T,
decay.

The speed of this interdot decay process is important,
and for that reason we now measure the J\ time using
the pulse shown in the inset of Fig. 2e. The pulse con-
sists of an adiabatic ramp across the polarization line be-
tween the points labeled R (readout) and O (operation)
in Fig. 2c, occupying a mixture of (3,2), and (3,2)¢ be-
cause of the small Egy. The state then abruptly pulses
to the region of high reset fidelity where the latched state
is not accessible and is held for a time ftyolq to allow ei-
ther (3,2) state to relax to (4,1),. After a time thoja, the
pulse abruptly returns to the readout point where the
latched state is accessible to the excited state. Plotted
in Fig. 2e is the latching probability, which decreases as
a function of thoig as more states relax to (4,1), through
the T; process. Two exponential curves are visible in the
data. We argue that these correspond to two relaxation
processes to (4,1), from (3,2), and (3, 2)¢, respectively.
The extracted T; times are 301 ns for (3,2)e > (4,1)g,
and 4.3 ns for (3,2), — (4,1)g. We assign the slower
transition rate to the (3,2)e — (4,1), process, because
we measure the excited state tunnel coupling between
(3,2). and (4,1), to be smaller than the ground state
tunnel coupling between (3,2), and (4,1), (see Appendix
B for details).

To demonstrate that the active reset functions on-
demand, Fig. 2f reports the reset fidelity as a function of
tmeas acquired for four different values of the reset pulse
parameter twait- The rate of change of the reset fidelity

follows that of the natural decay of the latched state
(slowly increasing curve fit with the red dashed line),
until the reload pulse is sent at time tyait, at which point
the rate of change significantly increases (four curves fit
with black dashed lines), showing that with this active
reset pulse, the qubit begins a rapid reset as soon as the
active reset pulse is applied.

Having discussed how and why the active reset works
in the region indicated by the blue dot in Fig. 2c, we now
look at what happens outside this region in voltage space.
We look first at a region of similar double dot detuning
€ but larger 6 (the direction perpendicular to the axis),
as indicated by the red diamond in Fig. 2c, which marks
a location in voltage space where there is a significant
decrease in P(4,1). In this regime, the latched state (3,1)
is higher in energy, so that additional (3,2) excited states
are accessible for the latched state to decay into, and
these states can be longer lived. Performing the same
tawell Measurement as before in this region, the red line
in Fig. 2d initially begins to increase rapidly, but after
~ 1 ps, the rate of change of P(4,1) drastically slows
down.

This behavior suggests that the system becomes
“stuck" in a long-lived (3,2) charge state when reseting
at this location. We model this behavior using the three
state model shown in the inset of Fig. 2d, where state A
is the (3,1) latched state, state B is a higher lying (3,2)
charge state, and state C is a (4,1) charge state. Assum-
ing exponential decays as shown in the inset of Fig. 2d
with decay rates given by I), Po, and Ts, and an initial
condition of starting in state A, we solve a set of three
coupled rate equations, similar to the model described
in the supplemental material in Ref. [26], that yield a
probability of ending up in state C given by,

The dashed black line in Fig. 2d is a fit of the data to
his expression, and it captures well the shape of the red
curve. The extracted decay rates from this fit reveal that
/T2 = 6.87 ps is approximately 10 times slower than
/T1 = 0.64 ys and 1/['3 = 0.75 pus. These parameters
are consistent with the hypothesis that there is a long-
lived (3,2) excited state accessible at the location of the
red diamond in Fig. 2c, and that the effect of that state
is visible in the slow rise of the red curve in Fig. 2d. More
generally, we note that in a double dot with 5 electrons
here are other states that could also be long lived, and
in Appendix C we describe one such example.

Moving to the upper left from the blue point in Fig. 2c,
he high-fidelity reset region stops at the location of the
dashed red line, which corresponds to the singlet-triplet
splitting of the left dot, E*,,, as determined by the pulsed
gate spectroscopy measurements shown in the lower in-
set. It is interesting to look at what happens when at-
empting to reset at a location to the upper left of this

in that regime. Figs. 3a-c show again a 2D map of the
probability P(4, 1) acquired using the pulse shown in the
inset of Fig. 2b, acquired now for three values of taweu-
Focusing on the region to the upper left of the dashed red
line, we note that in this region the (3,2) states, easily
accessible from the (3,1) latched state, can decay in turn
either to (4,1), (the desired re-initialization state) or to
(4, 1)e, as shown by the blue decay paths in Fig. 3d.

Because (4,1), and (4,1). produce the same charge
sensing signal, to differentiate between them we employ
a special pulse sequence that traverses the various energy
states and anti-crossings in the dispersion diagram, as
shown in Fig. 3d. Step I initiates the (3,1) latch; Step
II offers decays to either (4,1), or (4,1)¢; to differentiate
between these two, the voltage ramp to Step III shifts the
states in detuning, mapping (4,1), to itself (which does
nothing), and mapping (4,1). to the (3,2) state, which
then relatches at Step IV. Thus, by employing this pulse
sequence and looking for a second latching event, we can
identify which (4,1) state was occupied and with what
probability.

The lower right inset of Fig. 3d shows the probability
of seeing a second latching event given the observation

of the first latching event, P(2nd|1st). The bright yel-
low region indicates a significant probability of observing
such a second latching event. In this region, the latched
state (3,1) decays to (4,1)., which then maps adiabat-
ically to a (3,2) state during the transition to Step III.

For short 72, where little ti

me is permitted for the qubit

sition, then an inelastic tunneling event brings the qubit
to the singlet ground state, |S(2,0)), completing the ini-
tialization. This second step is the key component to
having this active reset work quickly. In the QDHQ, we
take advantage of the additional charge degree of free-
dom at low double dot detunings to allow the qubit to

IV. DISCUSSION

To ameliorate the issue of long initialization times out
of a latched state, we presented an active baseband re-
set pulse that re-initializes a qubit on-demand, quickly,
and with high fidelity. The efficiency of this reset relies
on the fast inelastic tunneling process that occurs in the

charge-like regime of a double quantum dot. The win-
dow for this reset is bounded by the ST splitting, E*.,,

and corresponds to the region of high reset fidelity shown
in Fig. 2c. In this window, we are able to re-initialize
our qubit out of a latched state on-demand, with a re-
set fidelity > 99.5% within 4 ys, significantly faster than
relying on the natural decay of the latched state while
maintaining excellent latched readout.

In addition to the regions of high reset fidelity, we also
identified regions to avoid when using the active reset
ulse. Within the ST splitting of the qubit, when at-
tempting to initialize in regions of larger 6, like in the red
diamond region in Fig. 2c, additional excited states be-
come energetically accessible to the latched state. These
additional excited states can have significantly longer re-
axation times, resulting in a reduction of the reset fi-
delity. We considered a simple three state model, which
fits the data in this region quite well. The region at
arger detuning, beyond the ST splitting, should also be
avoided, because it enables relaxation out of the latch to
(4,1)e, which is not the desired re-initialization state.

The active reset out of a latched state in this work was
performed on a QDHQ in Si/SiGe; however, this tech-
nique can be applied to other types of spin qubits as well.
Latched Pauli spin blockade (L-PSB) is a common read-
out method employed in other types of spin qubits, such
as singlet-triplet qubits, exchange-only qubits, and even
Loss-DiVincenzo qubits for parity readout [27-29]. L-
PSB latches standard PSB states onto a third metastable
state by pulsing into the L-PSB window with the proper
tuning of reservoir tunnel rates, analogous to how latched
readout was performed here. The same two-step decay
process discussed here can be applied to L-PSB, by puls-
ing back into the standard PSB window. In this window
the latched state first quickly decays to the excited triplet
state |7>(1,1)) of the qubit through a fast reservoir tran-

spin-orbit coupling, like silicon, the singlet-triplet relax-
ation rate tends to be much longer, on the order of tens
of milliseconds, which would significantly slow the rate
of initialization. This technique could, however, be used
in conjunction with other methods of increased singlet-
triplet relaxation to speed up qubit initialization, such
as the 7; “hot spots" around ST qubit anti-crossings, as
demonstrated in Ref. [30].

APPENDIX A: SINGLE-SHOT DATA ANALYSIS

The bias tee after the cryogenic amplifier acts as a high
pass filter for the charge sensing signal. Because of this
high pass effect, we use a two-part algorithm to effec-
tively track the start and end times of latching events.
Fig. 4 shows an example time trace that exhibits both
parts of the algorithm. We start by applying a function
to our SET data that uses the pruned exact linear time
(PELT) method [31] to look for abrupt changes in its av-
erage value, resulting in the yellow trace in Fig. 4. With
this transformed data, we search for an initial latching
event within 10 js of the applied pulse. Such events are
cleanly identified by a sharp step up, and they can be
easily timestamped. For long-lived latching events, the

blue trace is the raw SET data and the yellow trace is the
transformed PELT data showing the abrupt changes in the
average value of the SET data. The red trace is the pulse
marker and shows when a pulse is applied. Visible are two
example latching events, one that is long lived whose signal
response is affected by the high pass filter, and a short lived
atching event whose signal response isn’t affected by the high
pass filter.

high pass filter returns the SET response to 0 V before an
unlatching event, as is visible in the first event in Fig. 4.
n this case, when the system unlatches, the PELT trace
shows a clear step down, which again is easy to times-
amp. Short-lived latching events, on the other hand, are
not affected by the high pass effect, and therefore the end
of the latching event cannot be timestamped by looking
for a negative peak: the downward step does not go very
negative, because it is starting from a positive value. In-
stead, when no negative steps are found, the algorithm
looks for large negative changes in the PELT data close
o the start of the latching event, which correspond to
he unlatching event of a short-lived latched state, as is
visible for the second event in Fig. 4.

APPENDIX B: TUNNEL COUPLING
MEASUREMENTS

We measure the ground and excited state tunnel cou-
plings of the double dot by inducing Landau-Zener transi-
tions and measuring the probability of observing a latch-
ing event as a function of the ramp times across the an-
ticrossings, as shown in Fig. 5. The excited state tunnel
coupling te, is extracted by fitting an exponential to the
data in Fig. 5b, and it is found to be teg = 31 MHz, much
smaller than the values for tj, and t,. that we report be-
low.

Due to asmall valley splitting in this device, it becomes
difficult to ramp across the ground state anti-crossing tg,
without also moving across the excited state anti-crossing
tye. For this reason, we perform two experiments, as

shown in Figs. 5c,d, in order to gain enough informa-
tion to extract both tunnel couplings. Starting in (4, 1)4,,
we calculate the probability of returning to state (4,1),
after ramping in and out across all four anti-crossings.
We employ a four-state model, taking into account all
possible Landau-Zener transitions during the pulse. The
complement of this expression is the probability of end-
ing up in any excited state, which have the ability to
enter a latched state. We then simplify this expression
by taking the two extreme cases of an abrupt ramp out
(corresponding to the data in Fig. 5c), and an adiabatic
ramp in (corresponding to the data in Fig. 5d), resulting
in

‘ —20
fi(t) =1— exp (soa (Ge nu HeDbsenn ) (1)

and

. —20
fo(t) = exp (rear lean | (2)

respectively. The data in Fig. 5c and d is then simulta-
neously fit to equations | and 2 to extract the ground
state tunnel coupling tj, = 517 MHz and the excited
state tunnel coupling tye = 232 MHz.

Possible spin configurations when resetting a (3, 1)

latched state through the excited valley state of the right dot.
When first entering the latched state, the two remaining va-
lence electrons can have either parallel or anti-parallel spins
(row 2). When resetting through the excited valley, either a
spin up or spin down electron can tunnel onto the right dot,
leading to the four possible states shown in the bottom row.
Here, the black arrows show the available (4,1) reset paths,
with a spin-blocked configuration on the far left.

APPENDIX C: 5-ELECTRON EXCITED STATES

INVOLVING A RIGHT DOT VALLEY
EXCITATION

There are many 5-electron double dot excited states
that are not shown in the figures in the main text. Here,
in the bottom row of Fig. 6, we illustrate four such states
that have a valley excitation in the right dot. (Without
loss of generality, in this figure we assume the unpaired
spin in the left dot has $, = +1/2.) While during qubit
operation these states are not expected to significantly

couple to the four 5-electron double dot states
in the main text, and therefore should not impact
coherent manipulation of the hybrid qubit, they could
principle be accessed when reloading from (3,1)
at the location of the blue dot in Fig. 2(c). Since
electron loading from the reservoir can be either spin

or spin down, the pathways shown result in four different
spin configurations of the double dot system. The state

shown on the lower lef

such behavior here, suggesting that the excited val
