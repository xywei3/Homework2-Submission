ABSTRACT: We advance the study of flat space holography by computing the entanglement
entropy of highly excited states in two-dimensional Carrollian/Galilean Conformal Field
Theories (C/G CFTs). Our approach is centered on a novel, physically intuitive derivation
of the heavy-light conformal block in the large central charge limit, where the backreaction
of heavy operators is absorbed by a C/G conformal coordinate transformation. Using this
result and the replica trick, we find that the entanglement entropy of highly excited states
assumes a thermal form, providing a concrete realization of the Eigenstate Thermalization
Hypothesis (ETH). This field-theoretic result perfectly reproduces the holographic entan-

glement entropy computed via the swing surface proposal in three-dimensional Einstein
gravity, for backgrounds corresponding to spinning particles and Flat Space Cosmological
solutions. This agreement establishes a precise dictionary relating the weight A and charge
€ of the boundary state to the mass m and angular momentum j of the dual spacetime,
offering a powerful consistency check for the Flat/CCFT correspondence.

1 Introduction

In pursuit of genuine quantum gravity, the emergence of spacetime is the most fun-
damental yet enigmatic conundrum, a solution to which remains an aspiration of human-
ity. RT formula [1] in well-established AdS/CFT serves as a cornerstone that allows us to
probe the bulk geometry of quantum gravity from quantum information theoretic quantity,
namely the entanglement entropy, in boundary QFT without gravity. However, whether
the narrative extends to more realistic model like flat holography or dS/CFT remains
elusive. Towards the full picture of bulk emergence in flat holography, this paper aims
to delineate the generic framework to compute entanglement entropy for broader class of
asymptotically flat spacetimes from the boundary Carrollian/Galilean CFT. Specifically,
we calculate it in the presence of highly excited states through conformal blocks analysis.

Before discussing further details, let us first outline the recent developments in flat
holography. The Flat/Carrollian CFT correspondence [2-5] is the holographic principle
that relates the quantum gravity on asymptotically flat space with the Carrollian CFT
(CCFT), also known as BMS field theory field theory, on the codimension one asymptotic

null boundary with time direction. Despite several unique challenges including the peculiar
Carrollian behavior [6-8] and the non-conserved gravitational charges [9, 10] due to the
null boundary, Flat/CCFT has been the focus of intensive research in the past decade. As
a holography, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of flat cosmological horizons matches with
the Cardy formula in CCFTs [{11, 12]. The partition functions are discussed in [13, 14],
and the one-loop determinant corresponds to the CCFT vacuum character. The bulk
reconstruction is discussed [15, 16], and the top-down construction from AdS/BCFT can
be found in Ref. [17]. The CCFT entanglement entropy is calculated by twist operator
or Rindler method [18] and it can be compared to the swing surface proposal [19], which
generalizes the RT formula [1] in AdS/CFT. Besides, CCFT itself is the target of interest
as a special kind of quantum field, with the developments on the correlation functions [20],
bootstrap method [21-24], the detailed scalar/fermion models [25-31] among others.

We note that there is another approach, celestial holography [32, 33], where CFT exists
on a codimensions two boundary without time direction. Since gravitational S-matrix
elements expressed in a boost eigenstate basis resemble conformal correlation functions,
it excels at analyzing gravitational scattering problem. Its relation to Flat/CCFT has
been gradually coming to light [34-37]. However, we restrict our attention to Flat/CCFT
and hereby present our new results on conformal block and entanglement entropy as a
contribution to the established body of work.

Main results

(i) Carrollian/Galilean conformal block

We present the systematic and analytical calculation of conformal blocks for both light
and heavy-light operator configurations in 2D Carrollian/Galilean CFTs at large central
charge. A key finding is that, in the large central charge and heavy weight and charge
limit,

(ii) Entanglement entropy in the presence of heavy states and holography

Leveraging these results and the assumption of vacuum block dominance, we compute the
entanglement entropy for states excited by a heavy operator. The final result for a single
interval on the cylinder is

We note that this result is identical to the vacuum entanglement entropy on a non-trivially
identified cylinder. Furthermore, when the boost charge exceeds a specific threshold (= >
cu /24), the parameter a becomes purely imaginary and the entropy assumes a thermal
form, signaling the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) in these theories.

Finally, we establish a precise holographic match. Our C/G CFT derived entangle-
ment entropy for heavy states perfectly agrees with the holographic entanglement entropy
computed via the swing surface proposal in 3D flat space, for either conical defect or Flat
Space Cosmology (FSC) solutions (see eqs. (5.22), (5.23)). This agreement establishes a
concrete dictionary that links the weight A and charge € of the excited state to the angular
momentum j and mass m of the dual spacetime.

Relation to previous literature

Our discussion is predicated on the pre-existing result in CFT outlined in Section 2.
The C/G conformal blocks are first obtained by Hijano in Ref. [38] via monodromy method,
where they are determined by solving a second order differential equation that arises from
the existence of null vector in the representation of Carrollian/Galilean conformal algebra
(3.2). For better clarity, our contribution is systematically deriving the blocks by more
physically intuitive way of Ref. [39] in CFT2. For simplicity, we consider the case where
the propagating operator is a singlet under Mo.

We then compute the block in certain large central charge limit to deduce the entan-
glement entropy in C/G CFT in the spirit of Refs. [40, 41], where the conformal block in
holographic CFT», in the large c limit is computed. In 2d Galilean/Carrolian CFT, the
vacuum entanglement entropy for single interval is already derived in Ref. [18]. Later, the
RT formula [1] in AdS/CFT is extended to flat holography version known as swing surface
proposal [19, 42], and the resulting holographic calculation for 3d Minkowski spacetime
agrees with the result of Ref. [18]. Our result serves as a further confirmation of swing
surface proposal by showing the agreement of boundary heavy excited states entropy with
the bulk holographic entropy for excited geometries, including FSC and conical defect
solutions.
Plan of the paper

This paper is organized as follows (See Fig. 1 for the logical flow). In Section 2, we
review entanglement entropy in 2D CFTs with large central charge and its holographic
dual in AdS3. In Section 3, we introduce the fundamentals of two-dimensional Carrollian /-
Galilean conformal field theories (CF Ts), with a focus on the highest weight representation.
Key topics include symmetries, stress tensors, correlation functions, and particularly the
block expansion of four-point functions.

Section 4 presents our main results. We derive conformal blocks for light and heavy-
light operators in various large central charge limits, and demonstrate how the full blocks
reduce to global blocks under specific C/G conformal transformations. Section 5 applies
these blocks to compute excited state entanglement entropy and matches it with holo-
graphic results via the swing surface proposal, and establish a dictionary between C/G
CFT heavy excitation and bulk spacetime parameters.

Appendix A provides brief overview of the swing surface proposal for holographic en-
tanglement entropy in asymptotically flat spacetimes, focusing on its geometric construc-

tion and relation to modular flow.

2 Review of entanglement entropy at large-c in AdS3/CFT»

In order to compute the entanglement entropy in 2d Carrollian/Galilean CFT at “large
central charge”, we first recap the well-trodden case of CFT» in the large-c limit and how it
agrees with the semi-classical holographic entanglement entropy in the AdS3 bulk. Inspired
by the strategy in CFT2, the following sections (Section 4 & 5) provide our new results in
2d Carrollian/Galilean CFT.

Returning to the review of CFT2, the calculation simplifies dramatically in the limit
of large central charge c >> 1 and does not depend on the details of the spectrum (operator
content and fusion rules) of CFT2. This connection relies on the replica trick [43] and the
universal behavior of conformal blocks [40, 41].
2.1 Entanglement entropy from the replica trick at large c

The entanglement entropy S4 := — Tra palogpa of a subsystem A is calculated via
the replica trick in CFT» [43]. To this end, one first computes the n-th Rényi entropies

For a single interval of length L > 0 with its end points at u,v € C, one needs to prepare n
copies of the original CFT2, glue them together on the intervals, and compute its partition
function Z,, so that p% = a is obtained. In CFT2, however, Tr p% for a single interva.
is equivalent to the two-point function of local twist operators J, at the endpoints of the
interval

Tr 0 = (Tn(u)Tn(v)), (2.3

where the conformal weight is Ay = 37(n — 1). It yields

and taking the limit n — 1, one lands on the Calabrese-Cardy formula [43] for the vacuum
entanglement entropy

Sa = lim S4 = £08 (2). (2.6)
Note that the above formula captures only the holomorphic sector, and the full non-chiral
result is S4 = § log (4) :

2.2 Excited state entropy from the heavy-light blocks and thermalization

We next consider the entanglement entropy in an excited state created by the insertion
of a heavy local operator Oz, whose conformal dimension scales with the central charge,
hy = O(c). The calculation of Tr py now requires computing a heavy-light type four-point
function of the form (O7(co)Tn(u)Tn(v)Ox(0)).

At large c, the heavy operators significantly back-react on the geometry. The implica-
tion of Ref. [41] is that the heavy-light conformal block can be computed via a conformal
transformation from the plane (the vacuum background) to the back-reacted geometry
created by the heavy state |H) := lim On(z) |0). The transformation is achieved by
Zz

w(z)=2%, a= 4/1 sa (2.7)

which maps the plane to a cone with a deficit angle 27(1 — a). In the limit 1 < hy <c,

hy/c = O(1) the vacuum block is approximated by

To verify the CFT result, we apply the RT formula in the BTZ geometry. The task is to
compute the length of a spatial geodesic anchored at the endpoints of the interval on the

This geodesic calculation from the BTZ metric (2.12) yields a length

3 2d Carrollian/Galilean CFTs in a nutshell

Before embarking on the study of 2d Carrollian/Galilean conformal block in analogy
with CFT» result stated in the previous section, let us encapsulate the fundamental aspects
of 2d Carrollian/Galilean conformal field theories which will be used in the later discussions.

The 2d Carrollian/Galilean (C/G) conformal field theories are quantum field theories
that remain invariant under the following transformations,

G=f(e), G=f'(x)y+g(a). (3.1)

The generators implementing transformations on the fields are denoted as Lm and Mn.
These generators form the two-dimensional Carrollian/Galilean conformal algebra, also
known as the BMS3 algebra,

c
(Ln; Lm] = (n—m)Lmin 4 nn 1)dm+n0,
(Zn; Mm] = (n-—m)Mm+n 4 > n(n? 1)bm+n.0; (3.2)

[Mn, Mm] = 0,
where cy and cy are central charges. Consider the following infinitesimal translation
ortot+e, TOTHE, (3.3)

where ¢ and € are constants. The Noether theorem allows us to derive two conserved

currents,

Qrj- = —eTdo + €Mdr, (3.4)
Injz = —EMdo, (3.5)

where T and M play the role of the stress tensors. Then the infinitely many charges on

the plane can be written as

Ly = a (ey + (n+ L)a"yM ) de, (3.6)

where g denotes the contour integration around the origin on the complexified « plane and

From the algebra (3.2) we have the following OPEs between the currents,

For later convenience, we can define

which leads to the conservation law of the stress tensor

OyT) = OyT — 07M =0, OyM =0. (3.15

The charges L,, can related to To directly,

The transformation law of the newly defined operator To reads,

(3.17)
The operators in the highest weight representation can be organized into primaries
and their descendants. The primary operators at the origin are labeled by the eigenvalues
(A, &) of (Lo, Mo)

[Lo, O] = AO, [Mo, O] = €0, (3.18)

where A and € are referred to as the conformal weight and the boost charge respectively.
They obey the highest weight conditions

[Ln,O]=0,  [M,,O]=0, n>0. (3.19)

Acting L_,, M_, with n > 0 successively on the primaries, we get their descendants. This
definition can be generalized to the multiplet. A highest-weight primary multiplet O with
rank r is defined by

[Lo, Oa] =AOa, — [Mo, Oa] = (€O)a, a =0,---r—
[Ln, Oa] =0, [Mn,O.]=0, n>0, (3.20)

where O, denotes the a-th component of the multiplet O, and € is a Jordan cell with rank
r and diagonal component €,

4 Conformal blocks in 2d C/G CFTs

In this section, we deal with the C/G conformal blocks organized by the entire C/G
algebra instead of the global C/G algebra, in the large central charge limit. This paper
focuses on the scenario where the propagating operator is a singlet, serving as the starting
point for block calculations.

One can define the projector |O| onto the family of O containing all the descendant
operators related as

|O| = 7(Naslay (Bl, (4.1)
a,8
where the summation of a and (3 is over all the descendent operators of O, and Nag = (a|)
is the inner-product matrix. We should also drop all the null states in this projector. The
identity operator can be decomposed into the summation over all the projectors

1=)5°|O|. (4.2)

Here comes the following decomposition of a 4-point function

(O(co, 0)O(1, 0)O(x, y)O(0, 0)) = YS go(x,y), (4.3)
{O}
where go(x) is the contribution from each operator family

Oo

go(,y) = (O(c, 0)O(1, 0)/OJO(z, y)O(0, 0)) = (4.4)
O(1,0) O(z,y)

Note that it contains the C/G conformal block together with the coefficient related to the
3-point coefficients. In the following, we consider the C/G blocks in the large central charge
limit. The theory involves two central charges cy, and cy, so we must carefully examine
which of these serves as the expansion parameter.

4.1 Light type

We first examine the case where all external operators are light, meaning their charges
€ and weights A are O(1) compared to the suitably chosen central charge. The conformal
blocks and correlation functions involving only light operators are called the light type.
Large cy, limit

First, we consider the four-point function in the following limit

, e
cu > oo, with fiexed A,é,A,,&-, but = > 0.
Cu

This condition encompasses several cases including cz, ~ O(1), cz ~ O(e,s), and so
forth. Under this limit, the C/G conformal block involving four identical external light
operators reduces to the global C/G block, as we can see as follows.

We denote the projector for a specific family at level n as

—my, —m2
n=njymyt+-+ngm2+-

(4.6
where N~! is the inverse matrix of the inner product at level n. Due to the fact that the
descendant states at different levels are orthogonal, the projector can be decomposed into

We observe that the inner product matrix at each level n exhibits an approximate block-

diagonal structure. The basis elements can be systematically labeled based on the tota
count of L_, and M_, operators with n > 2. When these basis elements are arranged in
ascending order according to this count, the corresponding inner product matrix demon-
strates a behavior characterized by its block-diagonal approximation

O(1) O(1) «+ O(1)
O(1) Oem) --- O(en) (4.8)

Then, the non-diagonal blocks of the inverse matrix exhibit a magnitude of at least
O(1/enr). At leading order approximation, the projector can be decomposed into

lO] = D7 1Olk:: (4.9)
{k}

where

Ole, = > LM.» M™ -|Ap, &) (Ap, Er] += My" LENT) mini (4.10)

ky=mytn;

12
The vector k serves to label the number of generators present at each respective level within
the system. To illustrate this concept, we provide examples of contributions at the initial
orders below,

e k =(1,0,0,---), the basis are L_1|O), M_1|O).

e k= (2,0,0,---), the basis are L_yL_,|O), L_;M_,|O), M_;M_,|O).

e k =(0,1,0,--+), the basis are L_2|O), M_2|O).

The summation encompasses all possible values of the vector k. When considering the
large cjg expansion, the inner product matrix N; can be further represented as a tensor
product,

Noy tk = Ni ® Neo, if k1,k2 are orthogonal. (4.11)

Sequently, the analysis of the general case Nz simplifies to the analysis of N(o,9.... ,a,0,0,--):

these states can be computed through straightforward procedures, leading to

With the inverse matrix provided, it can be observed that the corresponding contributions
are suppressed by factors of a and wer These suppression factors, in turn, establish the
final condition outlined in eq. (4.5).

We also examine the contributions arising from three-point functions. These contribu-
tions are proportional to the parameters A, €, A,.,€,. A detailed derivation of their explicit
expressions will be provided in the subsequent subsection. In the context of the large cay
limit, as defined by eq. (4.5), all contributions stemming from higher descendant states
generated by the operators L_,,M_,where n > 2 are suppressed by a factor of at least
1/cyz. Consequently, the projector simplifies to

The leading term gives the global C/G blocks for the propagating operator O, when inserted

Large cy limit

We next proceed to analyze the limit cz, — oo. It is important to note that the pattern
cL ~ Cy — o has already been addressed in the preceding discussion. We will now focus
on the following case.

ct > 00, with fiexed A, €,A,, &-, ca.

The contributions arising from three-point functions remain same with those in the
previous case, so our primary focus shifts to the contributions derived from the inner
product. Specifically, we examine any state that belongs to the basis

19,1" ---|O) (4.16)

Note that these states are orthogonal to all other states to the leading order in the inverse
central charge expansion, specifically in terms of 1/cz. Their norms exhibit a proportion-
ality to ct, where a := 7724 n;. This scaling behavior results in their contributions being
significantly suppressed, so we may now focus on the remaining states, which form the
basis under consideration,

L’,M™M"}---\O). (4.17)

We first consider the states of the form M™!M™}---|O). These states exhibit a non-
vanishing inner product exclusively with the single state L’,|O), for which there exist
n—1 null states at level n. Upon subtracting these null states from the total set of states
at level n, the remaining states are

L1,M?,|O). (4.18)

This process subsequently yields the global C/G blocks. Consequently, the projector in
the context of the large central charge limit (4.15) takes the following form,

3 1
JO] = 0 L%M" |OOIMELI'(N-Y) nn + O(—). (4.19)

To summarize, as long as when the large central charge limits (4.5) and (4.15) are consid-
ered, the C/G conformal blocks of light type become the global blocks.

4.2 Heavy-light type

In this subsection, we examine another case where two external operators are heavy, in
the sense that their weights A and charges € being linear order in the large central charge,
while the remaining two operators are light. This configuration gives rise to the heavy-
light type of the C/G conformal block, so-named because of its external operator contents.
In the subsequent discussion, we focus on the large cay limit and do not elaborate on cz,
limit since it is hard to control. Note that this choice is not only for mere convenience
but physically plausible, given the holographically dual picture of 3d Einstein gravity in

14-
semiclassical regime G — 0 where the central charges of asymptotic symmetry algebra are
given by cp = 0, cyy = 2-
We define our notation by examining the following four-point function,

(O(c, 0)On(1,0)Oz(2x, y)OL(0,0)), (4.20)

with the weights and charges of the operators denoted as

An =H, 4 =5, Ar=A, & =§, (4.21)

and A, €, are the weight and charge of the propagating operator considered, which are
fixed under the large central charge limit.

Since the weights and charges of the heavy external operators are not fixed in the large
central charge limit, contributions from three-point functions involving higher descendant
states become significant. These contributions can compare to the contribution from the
large central charges in the inverse inner product matrix. To properly account for this, we
will examine two pairs of three-point functions that emerge after inserting the projector.
The one where the heavy operator is involved is

On(co,0)On(1,0)L",--»M™ ---O). (4.22
1 1

The other one involves light operators without dependence on the heavy weights and/or
charges. So we aim to investigate the dependence on the weights, charges, and centra
charges in eq. (4.22). Equivalently, utilizing equations (3.7) and (3.16), we may consider

which can be further structured from the stress tensor OPE and resulting Wald identity,

~ S23 (On (co, 0)On(1, 0)To(#i)O(0,0)) + S> (On (co, 0)On(1, 0) M(xi)O(0, 0)) + O(er, ems),

where O(cz, cys) is the central charge part, which will not contribute to eq. (4.22) due to
the vanishing residue. So the fundamental parts are

(O1(c0, 0)On(1, 0)To(a2)O(0, 0)) cao (aaa bg =): (4.25)
(On (00, 0)On(1, 0)M(2)0(0, 0) easo( Ga = rae (4.26)

In the following discussion, we first consider different cases where some weights and/or
charges are not fixed under the large cy, limit, then find the C/G conformal transformation

to cancel these dependence on the large weights and/or charges by the anomalous terms
in the stress tensors.

Large =

We start with the simplest case with large = with the following limit

15 -
em + 00, cr, H,A,€, Ar, & ~ O(1), a ~ O(1).

We want to find a C/G conformal transformation

r= fw), y= f'(w)z+ gw), (4.28)

to cancel the = dependence in eq. (4.26), so that

lim 0=(OqOqM(w)O) =0. (4.29)

eM—oo

This condition leads to the differential equation on the C/G conformal transformation
f(w), by considering the transformation law (3.23), (3.11)

4 oi {f(w),w} =0. (4.30)

"(wy 12

(ftw) 1p

The general solution contains three integration constants, which correspond to global trans-
formations that prevent anomalies in the stress tensor M. These constants can be employed
to determine the positions of the Oy and O operators. For simplicity, we select O(0,0),
Ox(1,0), and O7;(00, 0). The resulting solution is as follows,

v=1-(l-w)e, (4.31)

with a = +,/1— ae We will choose the positive one without loss of generality. This
transformation will give additional terms in eq. (4.25)

g C ou
(OnOnTo(w)O) = (OnOn(F°To(e)+2/'f M (2) +f? G02M (2) )O)+T w+ TS? a
(4.32)
Since (OyOyM()O) has term linear in = and {f, w} is proportional to = which is O(1),
we can simply choose g(w) = 0 so that
lim 0=(OqOyTo(w)O) = 0. (4.33)

eM —oo

So we conclude that in this case, the C/G conformal transformation

ca (4.34)
can cancel the large = dependence in eq. (4.22). It possesses fixed points at (0,0), (1,0),
and (co,0). The C/G conformal algebra and highest weight states remain preserved. A
branch cut is introduced on the w-plane extending from 1 to ov, rendering the Laurent
expansion at infinity invalid and causing the adjoint to be ill-defined. Despite this, out-
states and in-states in the (w, z) coordinates can be defined conventionally, though they
are not adjoint to one another.

—-16-—
Since the highest weight family is mapped to the family marked with the same primary
operator under the C/G conformal transformation, the projector in different coordinates
collect same contributions, while the four point functions are up to Jacobian due to the
transformation law (3.23),

go(x,y) = (On(00, 0)On (1, 0)|O|Oz (x, y)Or(0,0)) = Jo, («,y) Jo, (0,0) 90(w, 2), (4.35)

where J is the Jacobian factor
ity fl!
Jo = frei. (4.36)

Note that (x,y) is the flat plane coordinate, while (w,z) is not. Now the calculation of
the full blocks in (x,y) coordinate reduces to the calculation of the global blocks in (w, z)
coordinate, since the inner product in (w, z) coordinate has the same form when considered
in flat coordinate and the three point functions has no dependence on the heavy charge =
as discussed above. Besides, when we consider the global blocks ggjobal in (w, z) coordinate,
the actions of L_,, M_; has the same form as the flat one up to a Jacobian factor of the
propagating operator

Go(w, 2) = Jr \ggiovai(w, 2) + O(—). (4.37)

Compared the CFT results in Ref. [39], it shares a similar form but incorporates three

distinct modifications. The parameter a differs through the substitutions H > =,c > cy.
z(a—1)
Also, an additional exponential factor e6W=1a arises from the Jacobian (4.36). The global

block also varies since there exist two types of global C/G blocks for singlets with £- = 0
and €- # 0. In the & = 0 case, the global C/G block matches the global SL(2,.R) block
up to a normalization factor, which stems from the kinematic term ea.

In particular, the vacuum block which we will use later reads,

to cancel the H dependence in the (O7OyToO) correlator (4.25), so that

At the same time, this transformation may introduce cj dependence in the (O7On M(w)O)
correlator, by the transformation law (3.11). So we require

{fw} =0, (4.43

to avoid the linear cyy term. We can further fix the point (0, 1,00) on the x plane, leading
to

v= f(w)=w. (4.44

Now in the large cjg limit, eq. (4.42) reduces to

Although (0,0), (1,0) are the fixed point of this transformation, (00,0) in the (x, y) coordi-

invariant. This transformation leads to the Jacobian

We first look into the (OqO4M(w)O) correlator, where the discussion is in analog to that
in the large = case, leading to the same solution as (4.31),

Then we consider (4.25) with terms in eq. (4.32), resulting the differential equation on the

It is important to note that the discussion and results presented here remain valid even

4.3 Turn to the cylinder

In the preceding discussion, we focused on four-point functions on the (x,y) plane.
To clarify further, we transition to the cylinder described by (u,@) coordinates. The
transformation from the plane to the cylinder is

o=—ilogz, u=—i2, (4.60)

with periodic identification @ ~ ¢ + 2m. Then we can define another cylinder with (u’, 6’)
coordinate related to the (w, z) coordinate by the similar cylinder to plane map,

¢=—ilogw, w=—-i2. (4.61)
WwW

The key transformation to solve the C/G blocks in eqs. (4.52), (4.54) introduce the branch
cut runs from 1 to infinity on the w plane, with the deficit angle 27(1 — a).

Then we can consider the four-point function and the block expansion on the cylinder
to the periodicity manifest. Now the key transformation (4.52), (4.54) become

¢ =ad, uw =au+Qé¢, (4.62)

whose geometric interpretation is clear. It rescales and tildes the cylinder, making the new
identification
(u’, 9’) ~ (u' + 27aQ, ¢! + 27a). (4.63)

5 Application: Excited state entanglement entropy in 2d C/G CFTs

In this section, we utilize the C/G conformal blocks derived in the previous section
to compute the entanglement entropy of excited states in the context of large cjy, which
corresponds holographically to 3D Einstein gravity in asymptotically flat spacetimes. We
adhere to the same approach employed in the AdS3/CFT»2 case, as outlined in Section 2.

The entanglement entropy for an interval A in 2d Carrollian/Galilean conformal field
theories in the vacuum state can also be calculated by the twist operators [18]

S4=— lim
nln —

log Tra p'4, Tr p'4 = (Tn(®a; Ya) Tn (0; Yo))- (5.1)

The twist operators are inserted at the endpoints of the specified interval. Their weight
and charge can be determined from the conformal transformation or the limiting procedure

[18],

where l,,/4 are the length of the interval along the u and ¢ directions on the cylinder with
the identification ¢ ~ @+ 27. The result can be generalized to the tilted cylinder with the
identification (u, 6) ~ (u + 27aQ, d+ 27a) by considering the transformation

u>aut+Q¢, ¢> ad. (5.5)

In this case, the entanglement entropy reads,

_ 2 . alg cM _ (lu = Ql) aly
Sa A log (— sin )+ 5 (Q } 5 cot 5 ). (5.6)

5.1 Excited state entanglement entropy

We then consider the excited state in the highest weight representation
|An, x) = On(0,0)|0), (5.7)

created by a heavy operator acting on the highest weight vacuum, with weight and charge
Au,&#. Then the trace of the n-th power of the reduced density matrix is

Tr o'4 = (Of, (0, 0)Tn(@, ¥)Tn(1, 0)O%; (C0, 0)), (5.8)

where we consider the interval A with endpoints at (1,0) and (z,y) on the plane. This
configuration corresponds to the heavy-light type four-point function in the n — 1 limit,
where the weights and charges are

Also we consider the theory with large central charge cy,
em > 0, cr ~em (or er ~ O(1)). (5.10)

This aligns with our setup (4.49). Here, the aforementioned four-point function permits a
t-channel block expansion, where the C/G blocks can be approximated by the heavy-light
type block derived in the preceding section. Under the additional assumption of vacuum
dominance, where the leading contribution in this block expansion stems from the vacuum
block, we obtain the entanglement entropy of the excited state (5.7) using the t-channel
vacuum block (4.59),

Note that the expansion is in t-channel, where the length of the interval is given by
lecel—a, ly=y- (5.12)

Here, a few comments are in order. When cjy = 0, the result corresponds to that of chiral
CFT», representing the leading-order term in the large central charge expansion. When

21 =
a=1and Q =0, corresponding to a light background state, the expression reduces to the
vacuum entanglement entropy, with corrections anticipated at the next order.

Similarly, one can further generalize this discussion on the excited state entanglement
entropy to the cylinder geometry with the identification (u,) ~ (u,@+ 27), resulting

Sa = & log (2 sin we) + “— (2 , lhe 5 8d st a, (5.13)
This expression is identical to (5.6), which represents the entanglement entropy of the
vacuum state on a cylinder with the identification (u,¢) ~ (w+ 27aQ,¢ + 27a). In
other words, the entanglement entropy of an excited state on a cylinder with standard
identification can be interpreted as the vacuum entanglement entropy on a cylinder with a
non-trivial identification, determined by the charge and weight of the excited state.

In the case where

5.2 Compare with the holographic entanglement entropy

This section compares the excited state entanglement entropy with the holographic
entanglement entropy in constant mode solutions. On the bulk side, the dual theory
corresponds to Einstein gravity in three-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetime. For
flat holography, the holographic entanglement entropy is described by the swing surface
proposal [19, 42] (See also Appendix A).

The central charge can be related to the gravitational constant from the asymptotic
symmetry analysis in Einstein gravity [44]

en = 0, ey = e. (5.16)

The solutions with the asymptotically flat boundary condition are organized in the Bondi
gauge,

where u := t—r is the retarded time, r is the radial distance, and ¢ is the angle coordinate
of the S$" at infinity. When r — oo, it reaches the null infinity with the coordinates (¢, uv),
where the 2d C/G conformal field theory resides. In particular, the constant mode solution
is expressed as

Now, these results agree with the excited state entanglement entropy expressions given in

M>0: a&=VM, aQ=r-Sign(J). (5.25)
The global Minkowski vacuum has the mass and the angular momentum

Mvac = ~3@’ Jvac = 0. (5.26)

So for 3 < $Y, the excited state corresponds to a spinning particle, with the mass mp =

For 2 > $f, it corresponds to flat cosmological solutions with the mass m and angular

We observed that in the gravitational context, the angular momentum J may assume

operators with negative conformal weight A. Notably, the calculations of C/G blocks
remain valid even when H is negative.

6 Conclusion and discussion

In this work, we have advanced the study two-dimensional Carrollian/Galilean Confor-
mal field theories by systematically computing the highest weight conformal blocks in large
central charge limit and leveraging them to derive the entanglement entropy of excited
states, finding complete agreement with a holographic calculation in three-dimensional
asymptotically flat spacetimes in Einstein gravity.

We successfully calculated the conformal blocks for 2D C/G CFTs in the large central
charge limit, focusing on both the light-type and the heavy-light-type configurations. A core
implication is that in specific large central charge limits (4.27), (4.40), (4.49), the full C/G
blocks reduce to the global C/G blocks. This reduction is achieved by employing a C/G
conformal transformation (4.52), (4.54)

f(x) =1-—(1-2)*, g(x) =aQ(1— z)* log(1 — 2), (6.1)

designed to absorb the large charge and weight dependence from the operator product
expansions. Here, the parameters are defined as,

245 2_ 1)c, + 24H
a=4/1 Qe ae Re (6.2)
CM 207¢\

Geometrically, this transformation rescales and tilts the cylinder, leading to a new identi-
fication (u,¢) ~ (u+ 27aQ,¢+ 27a). Thus, the full C/G block is related to the global
block as (4.38),

“a a. exta=t) .
AML 2) 2A Ar SWE goropai(w, Z)- (6.3)

elit, 9(@,y) = (1 — w)
From these heavy-light blocks and the assumption of vacuum block dominance, we com-
puted the entanglement entropy for states excited by a heavy operator Oy. For an interval
on the plane, the entropy was derived from the t-channel vacuum block (4.59). After
mapping to the cylinder, the entanglement entropy of an excited state is identical to the
vacuum entanglement entropy on a non-trivially identified cylinder with the rescaled and
tilted geometry mentioned above. The final result is

er, (2 . alg cM a(ly — Ql¢) alg
Sa F log (< sin )+ 6 (2 ; 5 cot a): (6.4)

Furthermore, when the boost charge exceeds the threshold = > c,¢/24, the parameter a
becomes purely imaginary, a’ = ia, and the entropy takes a thermal form (5.15), providing
a signature of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) in these theories.

We further compared our 2d C/G CFT result of the heavy excited state entanglement
entropy with the holographic entanglement entropy in 3d flat space cosmological solutions
and conical defect solutions given by the swing surface proposal. The agreement is perfect
through the following dictionary between the C/G CFT and spacetime parameters

e For M < 0 solutions (spinning particles/conical defects): a = /—M, aQ = ro
e For M > 0 solutions (Flat Space Cosmologies): a! = VM, aQ = r,Sign(J)

This translates to a direct map between the quantum numbers of the excited state and the
charges of the spacetime,

Mp ==, Jp =H (for spinning particles) (6.5)

m=E+<5, j=H (for FSCs). (6.6)

Discussion and outlook

The recent research [16] suggests that the (light) bulk local excitations are fully re-
constructed from the states in the induced representation of the CCFT, while the highest
weight representation (HWR) provides limited result. There is growing evidence that the
induced representation may probe the more fundamental aspects of Flat/CCFT. However,
in this paper our analysis is heavily reliant on the HWR rather than the induced rep-
resentation since it is way straightforward to perform explicit calculations of conformal
blocks and entanglement entropy in the HWR, leading to the successful holographic match
described above.

One potential physical interpretation is that the HWR characterizes heavy primary
states, which induce back reaction effects manifesting as conical defects or FSCs in the

25 -
bulk, while the induced representation describes light excitations propagating on these
backgrounds that do not produce back reaction. Another potential interpretation is that
despite our calculation of entanglement entropy in the excited state within the HWR, the
final result still holds for highly excited states in the induced representation as well. The
naturally emerging future direction will be to re-examine the calculations of conformal
blocks and entanglement entropy using the induced representation, as this may advance a
microscopic understanding of flat space holography.

A Swing surface proposal

In this appendix, we detail the holographic entanglement entropy proposal for asymp-
totically flat three-dimensional spacetimes, so-called the swing surface proposal [19]. This
formulation provides the flat-space analogue of the RT formula in AdS/CFT. We first
briefly review the modern formulation of the RT surface in terms of modular flow, and
then we present the formal statement and geometric construction of the swing surface
from the action of the bulk modular flow.

A.1 Modular flow and the Ryu-Takayanagi surface in AdS/CFT

The RT proposal S4 = ane posits that the entanglement entropy S4 of a boundary
subregion A is proportional to the area of a minimal surface 7,4 in the bulk that is homol-
ogous to A [1]. A more profound understanding of this prescription arises from the replica
trick derivation [46] and the concept of modular flow [47].

For a given state described by a density matrix p, the modular Hamiltonian Ky of a
subregion A is defined via the reduced density matrix p4 := Trac p as

Ka :=—logpa. (A.1)

The unitary evolution U(s) = e~**4 is called the modular flow. In the context of Ad-
S/CFT, for a state dual to a classical geometry, the boundary modular Hamiltonian K4
has a corresponding bulk operator [47]

Hamiltonian associated with the entanglement wedge E,.

Figure 3. The geometric construction of the swing surface. The entanglement entropy of the
boundary interval A = [pi,p2] at null infinity % is given by the length of the bulk spacelike
geodesic 7 (the swing), which connects to the endpoints of A via two null geodesics 74 (dashed
orange).

The bulk modular flow generated by Kyux manifests as a geometric flow within the
entanglement wedge €4. The RT surface yy, is precisely the region left invariant by the
bulk modular flow. In the standard AdS/CFT setup, the boundary QA is also a fixed
point set of the boundary modular flow, and the minimal surface y,4 anchors directly on
it, such that O74 = OA. This correspondence is altered in the case of asymptotically flat

spacetimes.

A.2 Swing surface for holographic entanglement in flat space

In flat space holography, the boundary is null infinity .%7. A spacelike bulk surface can-
not anchor on a null boundary without violating its spacelike character at the intersection.
The swing surface proposal [19, 42] provides the modification through a composite bulk
surface, depicted in Figure 3.

The construction of the swing surface involves three components.

1. A spacelike geodesic y located deep in the bulk. This component is referred to as the

swing or bench.

2. Two null geodesics y, and y_ that extend from the endpoints of the bulk geodesic 7
to the endpoints of the boundary interval A on .%. These are the ropes.

The crucial distinction from the RT proposal is that the bulk spacelike surface y does not

anchor directly on the boundary OA. Instead, it is connected to OA via the null ropes 7+.
The physical origin of this detached structure lies in the distinct actions of the boundary
and bulk modular flows. While the endpoints of the boundary interval OA are fixed points
of the boundary modular flow, they are not fixed points of the bulk modular flow [48]. The
swing surface construction provides a precise geometric interpretation for this mismatch.

The holographic entanglement entropy for a boundary interval A is given by the area
(length in 3d) of the spacelike geodesic y4 (the swing).

The lengths of the ropes y+ do not contribute to the entropy since they are null.

The swing as the fixed-point set. The spacelike geodesic ¥y is the set of fixed points
of the bulk extended modular flow, generated by the bulk modular operator Ayu. It is
the direct flat-space analogue of the RT surface. Just as the RT surface is the minimal
area surface, the swing y is the extremal length spacelike geodesic whose endpoints are
determined by the termination of the ropes.

The ropes as integral flows. The null geodesics y+ are the integral curves of the
boundary endpoints 0A = {pi,p2} under the action of the bulk modular flow. They trace
the path of the boundary endpoints as they are evolved by the bulk’s geometric flow. This
evolution is non-trivial because, as mentioned, the points in OA are not fixed by the bulk
flow.

Junction points. The ropes 7+ originate at the boundary points p;, po € OA and termi-
nate at the bulk points q1,q2 € Oy. These junction points {q1,q2} are precisely where the
non-trivial orbits of the bulk modular flow, initiated at the boundary, intersect the set of
fixed points of that same flow. The swing 7 is then the minimal length spacelike geodesic
connecting these two termination points. This construction geometrically decomposes the
action of the modular operator. The ropes represent the dynamical “flow” part of the
evolution, while the swing represents the stationary “fixed point” or “horizon” part, whose

length gives the entropy.

This entire structure can be derived more formally from the Rindler method. By
finding a coordinate transformation that maps the entanglement calculation to a thermal
one, the entanglement wedge is mapped to a bulk Rindler wedge possessing a Rindler
horizon. The length of this Rindler horizon, which is by definition a fixed-point set of the
associated boost symmetry, exactly corresponds to the length of the swing y. This confirms
that the swing surface is the appropriate “entanglement horizon” for a subregion on a null

boundary.
