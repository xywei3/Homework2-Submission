ABSTRACT

The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a Compton telescope designed to survey the 0.2
- 5 MeV sky, consisting of a compact array of cross-strip germanium detectors. It is planned to be
aunched in 2027 into an equatorial low-Earth (530 km) orbit with a prime mission duration of 2 years.
The observation of MeV gamma rays is dominated by background. Thus, background simulation and
identification are crucial for the data analysis. In this work we perform Monte Carlo simulations o

order to determine the build-up of the activation due to long-lived isotopes. The simulations accoun'

of this work, a comparison at low latitude (|b| <1°) between recent measurement of the SAA and the
AP9/AE9 model has been made, showing an overestimation of the flux by a factor ~9 by the model.
The systematic uncertainties associated with these components are quantified.

1. INTRODUCTION but they can also induce a delayed background due to
the activation of the instrument materials. Thus, back-

The soft to medium gamma-ray regime (~ 0.1 —
30 MeV) is one of the least explored energy ranges across
the electromagnetic spectrum, having a sensitivity that
is orders of magnitude worse than the adjacent energy
bands. One of the main reasons for this is that detectors
that operate in this band suffer from high instrumental
backgrounds (BGs). The interactions of cosmic ray and
albedo particles not only induce a prompt instrumental
background when they deposit energy in the detectors,

ground simulation and identification are crucial for the

data analysis.

In this work we present the pre-flight background
estimates for the Compton Spectrometer and Imager
(COSI), a Small Explorer (SMEX) satellite mission
scheduled to launch in 2027 into a low-Earth low-
inclination orbit (Tomsick et al. 2023). COSI is a Comp-
ton telescope which operates as a wide-field imager,
spectrometer, and polarimeter. One of COSI’s strengths
2

is its good energy resolution, having a full-width half
maximum (FWHM) of 6.0 keV (9.0 keV) at 0.511 MeV
(1.157 MeV). Sixteen high-purity cross-strip germanium
semiconductor detectors (each 8 x 8 x 1.5 cm) are ar-
ranged ina 2 x 2 x 4 array that is sensitive to photons
between 0.2 to 5 MeV. The detectors are surrounded
on four sides and the bottom by active shields. The
scintillator material used is bismuth germanium oxide
(BGO), and they are read out by silicon photomultipli-
ers (SiPMs). The shields have several functions, includ-
ing passive background attenuation, active anticoinci-
dence for background radiation coming from the sides
and bottom, anticoincidence of gamma-rays that escape
from the germanium detectors, and finally they serve as
a gamma-ray transient monitor.

The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2,
we present the input models and software used for the
background simulations. The simulation results are pre-
sented in Section 3 and discussed in Section 4. Finally,
we give our summary and conclusions in Section 5.

2. BACKGROUND SIMULATION

2.1. Cosmic-ray and albedo components

The input spectra of cosmic rays and albedo compo-
nents are generated using the tool from Cumani et al.
(2019). We employ an updated version of the code',

which includes minor code corrections and more recent
data. The user can choose the main parameters, includ-
ing altitude, inclination, geomagnetic cut-off and solar
activity. Correspondingly, for the BGs we used the avy-
erage rigidity cutoff (12.6 GV) for COSI’s orbit which
range from 10.4 to 14.5 GV. Solar modulation for pro-
tons and helium is accounted for by using the HelMod
online tool (Boschini et al. 2018) under the assump-
tion of a data acquisition in the period March — June
2027. The extrapolation to the future solar activity and
corresponding solar modulation is done following Bos-
chini et al. (2022). Electrons and positron fluxes have
been extrapolated from the values measured with AMS-
02 (Aguilar et al. 2021) to the values expected in 2027
since no modulation is calculated in HelMod for such
primaries. The fluxes are calculated with the following
formula:

ratio from equation | can be used as a proxy for the mod-
ulation evolution since proton fluxes change in time in a
similar manner as electrons and positrons (see Aguilar
et al. (2023a,b) for more details). The albedo photon
and neutron spectra and fluxes, as well as the extragalac-
tic gamma-ray background (EGB) component are taken
from Cumani et al. (2019). In addition to the albedo
photons, the 511 keV line contribution from the atmo-
sphere is taken from Harris et al. (2003) and rescaled
to COSI’s altitude. The resulting spectra are shown in
Figure 1. All of the input files used for the simulations,
will be uploaded in the COSL-tools github repository”
during spring 2026. Simulations are using the energy
range 10?-10° keV for these components.

2.2. Galactic diffuse emission

The Galactic diffuse continuum emission is mod-
eled using the v57 release of the GALPROP cosmic-
ray (CR) propagation and interstellar emissions frame-
work (Porter et al. 2022). There are six models in total,
categorized according to the CR source and interstel-
lar radiation field (ISRF) model used for the prediction.
There are 3 CR source models (SAO, SA50, SA100) and
two ISRF models (R12, F98). These GALPROP mod-
els include the total emission, which is dominated by
inverse Compton radiation, but also has a small contri-
bution from Bremsstrahlung towards the upper energy

bound. For this work we simulate the SA100-F98 model
in the energy range 10-104 keV as the representative
case. The all-sky intensity map (at 501 keV) is shown
in Figure 2. The variations coming from the 6 different
models are pretty minimal (see Figure 3 in Karwin et al.
(2023).

2.3. MEGAlib software

The simulations employ the Medium-Energy Gamma-
ray Astronomy library (MEGAIib) software package 3, a
standard tool in MeV astronomy (Zoglauer et al. 2006).
Cosima is the simulation part of MEGAIib, based on
GEANT4 v11.2 (Agostinelli et al. 2003). It is able to
simulate the emission from a source, the passage of par-
ticles through the spacecraft, and their energy deposits
in the detector. MEGAlib also performs event recon-
struction, imaging analysis and general high-level anal-
ysis (ie., spectra, light curves, etc.). The mass model
used for the simulation is shown in Figure 3.

The MEGAIib simulation includes the activation of
the instrument induced by CR interactions. Currently,
two options are available for this. The first method is a
three step process. First, the initial particles and pho-
tons are simulated, which determines the prompt in-
teractions and a list of the created isotopes are stored.
The activity of each isotope is then calculated based
on a given time of irradiation in orbit. The final step
simulates the isotope decay at random positions within
the mass model volumes in which they were created.
The second method of activation simulations keeps in
memory each isotope created during the simulation un-
til it decays, with the expected decay time given by the
lifetime. This latter method accurately simulates the

veto conditions.

3

build-up of the activation during the flight, and it has
been used for this study. Given the substantial compu-
tational resources needed for such simulations, only the
first 3 months of orbit are simulated.

For this work, a basic detector effects engine (DEE) in

MEGAIib is applied to the simulated data to account for
detector and readout effects. These effects include veto-
ing events that interact in the shields, charge transport,
binning of energy deposits into strips, energy resolutions
and thresholds, depth resolution as well as trigger and

The events are then reconstructed using MEGAIib’s
revan (Boggs, S. E. & Jean, P. 2000; Zoglauer et al.
2006). A minimum distance of 0.5 cm between any in-

teractions is required for the Compton events. These
background simulations were performed as part of the
fourth Data Challenge + (DC4) that will be released by

the COSI collaboration in spring 2026. The purpose of
these data challenges is to aid in the pipeline develop-
ment, and to familiarize the astrophysics community on
how to analyze COSI data.

2.4. Geomagnetic Cut-Off Dependencies

The characteristics of the background components
composed of charged particles are modified by the geo-
magnetic field, which varies along the orbit. The space-
craft coordinates have been generated with SPENVIS°,
for 3 months of orbit, an altitude of 530 km, and an
inclination of 0°°. In addition, we added a +22° rock-
ing angle, with the northern sky observed for 12 hours,
followed by a 8 minute slewing time, and then the south-
ern sky observed for 12 hours (see Figure 4). The time

dependence of the instrument’s pointing on the sky is
simulated with MEGAIib using this orientation.

Based on these coordinates, the geomagnetic cutoff
(Reuto) (in GV) is computed using the python tool
OTSO (Larsen et al. 2023). We calculate the Reutot
for each time interval (15 s) of the 3 month orienta-
tion file, and use this to obtain the integrated spectrum
for each BG component. The Reuto dependencies for
each component are described in Cumani et al. (2019).
The time dependence of the background radiation due
to Reuto# variation is handled by including a light curve
in the simulations. Note that cosima only takes the light
curve shape into account, and the overall flux normal-
ization is set by the spectrum. We make the simplifying
approximation that the spectral shape is constant with

time. This is a reasonable assumption, considering that
the Reuto# only varies from 10.4—14.5 GV (see Figure 5).

2.5. South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA)

The South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) is a region where
the inner Van Allen radiation belt is closest to Earth’s
surface. Satellites passing through this area experience
high levels of radiation, primarily from protons and elec-
trons. Typically, scientific observations are paused while
a satellite traverses the SAA, although some diagnostic
data may still be collected. Protons interacting with
the satellite can generate both short and long-lived ra-
dioisotopes, which decay after the observation resumes,
contributing to the overall background. To model the
creation and decay of these isotopes, the initial step is to
estimate the SAA spectrum along a specific orbit. Since
we do not plan to use data taken during SAA passages,
we did not simulate the trapped electrons component.

The spectrum of the trapped protons is generated
using the model IRENE AP9 v1.57.004" (Ginet et al.
2013). The expected differential flux is computed for ev-
ery 15s of orbit (see Figure 7 for one SAA passage) and
then integrated over the energy to get the rate as func-
tion of time that MEGAIib will interpret as a light curve
(see Figure 8). This light curve will simulate the passage
of the satellite through the SAA. For the COSI orbit, the
duration of an SAA passage is around 17.5 min. This
time is estimated with the condition that the flux of the
trapped protons is not equal to zero. One could increase
this lower flux boundary to limit the cut in the data but
for the purpose of this work we choose to use this strict

condition when removing the SAA passages in the sim-
ulated data.

In order to reduce the simulation time, the spectrum
is truncated at 4 MeV. This is motivated by the fact
that we are only interested in activation induced by the
trapped protons during a SAA passage. As shown in
Figure 6, the proton cross-section with materials com-
monly found in the spacecraft is negligible below 4 MeV.
To test this, a 24h orbit has been simulated for a cut at
2 MeV, showing no significant difference from a cut at 4
MeV. We studied recent SAA measurements at low lat-
itude and found that the AP9/AE9 model is higher by
a factor of ~9 in this region, and therefore we scale the
predicted flux by this same factor, as discussed further
in Section 4.3.

3. RESULTS

The resulting spectra of the Compton events for each
component, as well as the total background, are shown
in Figure 9. The continuum background is dominated
by the extragalactic background photon up to 660 keV,
where the albedo photons component takes over. Pri-
mary protons and alphas particles contribute to this con-
tinuum but their main contribution to the background
is from the activation lines they create. The most im-
portant lines are listed in Table 1. Beyond 700 keV,
albedo photons dominate. Overall, the spectrum turns
down beyond 2 MeV due to saturation effects in the
germanium strips.

ween 0.2 and 5 MeV as a func-

tion of time are shown in the left panel of Figure 12.
On a daily timescale, the Compton event rate remains
relatively stable, except during the first few days when
it increases before reaching a plateau due to activation
build-up. At this scale, variations caused by the geomag-
netic cutoff (Reutor) are difficult to observe. However,
on a minute scale, the rate fluctuations become appar-
ent and are inversely correlated with geomagnetic vari-
ations, as shown in right panel of Figure 12. This result
in an apparent East/West asymmetry in the simulated
background due to the changes in Reutog. This asymme-

try was clearly observed in NuSTAR data (Grefenstette
et al. 2022).

3.1. Activation from the SAA

Despite the SAA passage cut, a residual tail can still
be observed in the Compton event rate after each SAA
passage, as shown in the left panel of Figure 13. This
delayed background is due to the satellite and detector
material undergoing nuclear excitation due to collision
with the trapped protons, and subsequently photons are
produced by the de-excitation of the activated material.

Using a similar approach made with Fermi GBM
data (Biltzinger et al. 2020), this tail is well fitted with

3.2. Extrapolation to 2 years of orbit

The total computational cost of the simulations
reached approximately 3 millions CPU hours (with 1
million just for the SAA °). Given the magnitude of
these computing resources, it was not feasible to extend
the simulations beyond the current time frame. Instead,
we chose to extrapolate our existing background model
to two years in orbit, using the actual outputs from the
Monte Carlo simulations. After such a long duration, we
expect the contribution from long-lived isotopes to be-
come significant, leading to new emission lines. There-
fore, we identified isotopes with half-lives between 1
month and 10 years which contribute to the background
at a measured rate greater than 107+ Hz, finding 18 in
total. Figure 14 shows the expected build-up of their
rate as function of time. The extrapolated production
rate R after 2 years of orbit inside the volume i of the
mass-model for the isotope j is defined as:

R(2y)} = R(3m)}, x Fy(2y), (3)

where Ri (3m), is the rate estimated from the 3 month
simulation and F;(2y) is the scaling factor to get the
expected rate after 2 years. This factor, defined as the
ratio between the production rate after 3 months and 2
years, uses the standard formula for exponential decay,
which can be expressed as:

dv

F; (2y) =

where t3m and tj, are the times (in seconds) for 3

months and 2 years, and \) = /82 is the decay con-
1/2
stant of the isotope j in s~!. The corresponding factors

for each isotope are listed in Table 3.

® The simulation was done using the nominal flux from AP9, so

overestimated by a factor ~9.

Some of the isotopes like ?2Na and °°Co were already
observed and tracked during COMPTEL and INTE-
GRAL/SPI missions (Diehl et al. 2018). As described in
Section 2.3, MEGAIib can simulate isotope decay at ran-
dom positions within the mass model volumes. We thus
give as input the list of volumes and isotopes with their
extrapolated rates after 2 years of orbit and run the sim-
ulation for 1 x 10” s in order to get sufficient statistics.
The resulting spectra for the Compton events are show
in Figure 15. The overall shape of the background stays
relatively constant with some new lines and a build-up
of some others like the 511 keV line. The expected rate
ratio between 2 years and 3 months of orbit for some
energies of interest are provided in Table 3.2.

4. DISCUSSION
4.1. Comparison with data

A previous study simulated the background for the
2016 balloon flight of the COSI prototype (Gallego et al.
2025). Since the observations were taken at balloon alti-
tudes within Earth’s atmosphere, the input models dif-
fered; however, because the satellite will use the same
type of germanium detectors, we can expect similar ac-
tivation lines. The simulation from Gallego et al. (2025)
successfully reproduced nearly all the activation lines ob-
served in the data, allowing us to distinguish those orig-
inating from natural radioactivity (and therefore not in-
cluded in our model) from those induced by atmospheric
background.

4.2. Known limitations of our background model

The current DEE in MEGAIib accounts for detec-
tor and readout effects but still at a simplified level.
The collaboration is currently developing a more ad-
vanced DEE that will be bench-marked with calibra-

tion measurements,

he solar activity was assumed to be

constant. In reality, the solar activity will vary dur-
ing the mission and the CR flux is known to be anti-
correlated with the solar modulation (Aguilar et al.
2021). INTEGRAL/SPI observed an anti-correlation
between the sunspot number and rates from activation
lines induced by charged particles (Diehl et al. 2018).
However, given the high level of modularity of our back-
ground model, we will be able to scale each individual
component contributions to better represent the change
with solar activity.

We did not simulate the contribution of other ions like
oxygen or carbon which are the most important after
helium. However, given their low flux in the same order
of magnitude as the primary electrons and positrons, we
can assume their contributions to the background to be
negligible.

12

Our current model does not take into account activa-
tion lines from natural radioactivity. Since some of these
lines (mostly from the ?3?Th and ?88U series) were ob-
served in the 2016 COSI balloon flight (Gallego et al.
2025) and also in space with INTEGRAL/SPI (Dichl
et al. 2018), we can expect to have a significant contri-
bution from it. Background measurements during the
calibration campaign will allow us to get an estimation
of its contribution prior to launch.

4.3. SAA uncertainties

By using the flux given by AP9, the instrumen-
tal background induced by the trapped protons within
the passage of the satellite through the SAA is one
of the most important background components. The
AP9 model shows good agreement with recent measure-
ments by the High-Energy Particle Detector instrument
(HEPD-01) on board the China Seismo-Electromagnetic
Satellite (CSES-01) in the central part of the SAA (Bar-
tocci et al. 2025). However, measurements from the
BeppoSAX satellite indicate that the AP9 model may
strongly overestimate the actual flux values for altitudes
below 600 km and inclinations below 5° (Ripa et al.
2020). For the work presented in this paper, we stud-
ied the comparison between the AP9 model prediction
and HEPD-01 data for a latitude window of [-1,1]°. The
altitude of the CSES-01 satellite (500 km) is close to
the expected COSI altitude, and likewise for the solar
activity (close to minimum).

For this study we selected the central part of HEPD-01
available data, starting from UTC 1562025600 (2 July
2019) to UTC 1640995200 (1 Jan 2022). HEPD-01 data?
are averaged within a +3 month window centered on the
given UTC, which gives 6 datasets in total. AP9/AE9
data are extracted within 6 days around the central UTC
for each dataset. In this region, HEPD-01 can only
provide rate data for a set of trigger masks (Bartocci
et al. 2025), so that no identification between the pro-
tons and electrons is available. We use data from the
trigger mask using an energy cut of 2.3 (29) MeV for
the electron (proton). Given this energy cut, the elec-
tron contribution is negligible. A y? fit is employed for
each dataset in order to find the best scaling factor S' to
apply to the AP9/AE9 model to better match the data.
Before each fit, we subtracted from HEPD-01 data the
baseline rate due to cosmic radiation and instrumental
noise. This contribution was estimated by taking the

average rate in the longitude region [0,150]°, far away
from the SAA. The average scaling factor from each fit
gives S = 0.114+ 0.047 (see left panel of Figure 16 for a
specific dataset). We thus applied this factor to the pre-
dicted flux from AP9 in order to take into account the
discrepancy observed by HEPD-01. The impact of the
uncertainties of the scaling factor on the SAA protons

component is shown in the right panel of Figure 16.

. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

In this work we simulated the pre-flight background
estimates for COSI. We modeled the background us-
ing updated cosmic-ray and albedo spectra, and the
Galactic diffuse continuum is modeled using the lat-
est GALPROP models. The simulations account for
time-dependent variations due to the geomagnetic cut-
off, SAA passages, and they include detailed modeling
of delayed activation from short/long-lived isotopes.

We find that the extra galactic background photon
dominates the background at low energies (<660 keV),

on

while delayed activation from cosmic-ray primaries (pro-
on/alpha) and albedo photons dominate at higher ener-

gies. Even for an equatorial orbit, the delayed activation
induced by passage of the satellite through the SAA is
non-negligible, especially for the 511 keV line, although
aking into account a potential rate overestimation by
he AP9 model drastically suppresses its contribution.
Time-dependent behavior due to the Reutog and SAA-
induced activation is quantified. Short-term activation
right after SAA passages is dominated by the isotopes
produced in the structure of the spacecraft. Our model
incorporates a high degree of modularity, enabling us to
refine it during the COSI commissioning phase in order
o better align with actual measurements.

Given the high computational requirements, simula-
ions were restricted to the first three months of COSI’s
orbit. To account for the full mission duration, long-
erm background levels were extrapolated out to two
years—the duration of the prime mission. These re-
sults are a critical foundation for optimizing COSI’s ob-
servational strategy and refining its background mod-
eling. The background model developed here will be
key to enabling detailed studies of COSI’s specific sci-
ence goals. Additionally, this work informed preliminary
in-flight calibration plans using activation lines, as de-
scribed in Valluvan et al. (2025).

This work marks a major step forward in understand-
ing the background rates for the COSI satellite mission.
These advances are largely made possible by recent im-
provements to GEANT4 and MEGAIlib. As we move
closer to launch, our background estimates will become
even more accurate through the development of an en-
