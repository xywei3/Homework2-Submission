Many-body effects and quantum criticality play a central role in determining the performance of
quantum thermal machines. Although operating near a quantum critical point (QCP) is known to
enhance engine performance, the precise thermodynamic conditions required to attain the Carnot
efficiency limit remain unsettled. Here, we derive the exact conditions for a quantum Stirling engine
to achieve Carnot efficiency when a QCP drives its working medium. In the low-temperature
regime, where only the ground-state manifold is populated, the net work output is given by
W = ke In(gerit /go) with 6 = Ty —T1, which directly yields the Carnot efficiency n¢ = 1—T,/Tu,
independent of microscopic details. Notably, whereas ideal Stirling cycles attain Carnot efficiency
only with a perfect regenerator, here no regenerator is required because, at low temperatures, the
thermal population remains confined to the degenerate ground state; this represents a clear quan-
tum advantage over engines with classical working substances. We validate this universal result
by recovering known behaviors in various quantum systems, including spin chains with Dzyaloshin-
skii—Moriya interactions and magnetic anisotropies. Applying the framework to the one-dimensional
antiferromagnetic Ising model, we predict non-extensive scaling of the work output governed by
Fibonacci and Lucas numbers for open chains and closed rings, respectively, which converges to
classical extensivity in the thermodynamic limit. This analysis establishes a general and robust
foundation for designing quantum thermal machines that reach the Carnot bound while delivering
finite work.

I. INTRODUCTION

Quantum thermodynamics investigates how quantum principles govern energy exchange and conversion at mi-
croscopic scales [1-13]. A central objective is to develop and analyze quantum thermal machines such as engines,
refrigerators, and heat pumps operating in the quantum regime that may exploit coherence, entanglement, many-body
effects, flat bands, and others to surpass classical performance benchmarks [1, 14-17].

Among quantum cycles, the Stirling cycle has attracted sustained interest due to its conceptual simplicity and
experimental accessibility to obtain finite work with highly efficiency [18-21]. It consists of two isothermal and two
isoparametric (or isochoric) processes, providing a versatile setting to probe performance limits. A recurring obser-
vation is that tuning the working medium near a quantum critical point (QCP) can markedly enhance performance
22-27|. A QCP triggered at zero temperature by varying an external control parameter, such as field or pressure,
eatures qualitative ground-state changes, divergent correlation lengths, and universal scaling [28]. The associated
arge density of states and enhanced fluctuations are widely regarded as a resource for thermodynamic tasks.

Extensive studies across diverse platforms, including Heisenberg spin chains [29-32], anisotropic qubit systems [33,
34], and models with Dzyaloshinskii—Moriya interactions [35-38], have reported enhanced work output and efficiency
when thermodynamic cycles operate across a QCP. Nevertheless, a general and exact analytical characterization of
he necessary and sufficient conditions to attain Carnot efficiency in critical quantum Stirling engines has remained
open, with many results relying on numerics or model-specific features, leaving questions about universality and the
role of ground-state degeneracies.

Here we present a general analytical framework for Stirling engines operating at a QCP. We show that, in the
low-temperature and large-gap regime, a cycle executed between a critical point with degeneracy gerit and a high-field
point with degeneracy go achieves precisely Carnot efficiency, with net work given by a simple universal expression
that depends only on the reservoir temperatures and the degeneracy ratio. We validate this result by quantitative
agreement with previously reported systems ranging from two-qubit setups to extended spin chains with nontrivial
interactions. We further apply the framework to the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Ising model [39-41], unveiling

a connection to number theory: the work scales with the logarithm of Fibonacci numbers for open chains and Lucas
numbers for rings, revealing a non-extensive quantum effect that disappears only in the macroscopic limit. Notably,
this critical-cycle route to Carnot efficiency does not require a classical regenerator.

In summary, our framework consolidates diverse findings into a unified theory and establishes experimentally testable
conditions for quantum thermal machines to attain the fundamental efficiency limit with finite work output.

Il. MODEL

The working medium consists of any physical system whose energy spectrum can be tuned by an external parameter
A, and which exhibits a QCP at A = Acrit when the temperature approaches absolute zero. At the QCP, the system
undergoes a fundamental transformation characterized by symmetry breaking and qualitative changes in the ground
state structure.

As illustrated in Fig. 1, the gerit-fold degenerate ground state at the QCP splits due to interactions with the tuning
parameter. For A > Acrit, the lowest-energy states separates into a ground state €9 with degeneracy go and an excited
evel €, characterized by degeneracy g;. At sufficiently large values of the tuning parameter (Aj;,), these two levels are
separated by an energy gap A.

Higher excited states €,5; play a negligible role in this regime. Near absolute zero temperature, the thermal
opulation of these states becomes vanishingly small due to the Boltzmann suppression factor. Even at the QCP, the
available thermal energy remains insufficient to significantly populate levels beyond the critic ground state. Only the
degeneracies of these higher energy levels at Acrit can influence the thermodynamic properties of the system through
heir contribution to the density of states at the critical point.

The thermodynamic properties of the system can be calculated and fully characterized through the canonical
artition function. Taking into account that at absolute zero each energy level EL; may be g;-fold degenerate, the
artition function is given by:

2(T) = 7 exp (2) (1)
The thermal equilibrium populations follow directly from the partition function through the Boltzmann distribution:

From the partition function and the associated Boltzmann probabilities, the standard relations of canonical ensemble
thermodynamics yield the Helmholtz free energy, entropy, and internal energy:

It is crucial to emphasize that in the zero-temperature limit for the two tuning parameters Acrit and Aq shown in
Fig. 1, the internal energy reduces to the ground state energy, while the entropy, in analogy to the microcanonical
ensemble formulation, is determined by counting the number of states sharing the same minimum energy, that is, the
degeneracy of the ground state at each parameter value:

III. STIRLING CYCLE AND CRITICALLITY
A. General Theory of the Quantum Stirling Cycle

The Stirling cycle is characterized by four stages: two isothermal processes and two isoparametric processes (where
the tuning parameter A is held constant). Unlike the well-known Otto cycle, the net heat and work contributions in
each segment are not directly evident from the trajectory of the cycle alone. Instead, they must be determined by
analyzing the entropy differences at each stage point throughout the complete cycle.

The isoparametric stages are analogous to the isochoric processes in a classical ideal-gas Stirling cycle, where volume
is fixed. In quantum and condensed matter systems, the fixed parameter A may represent various external controls
such as magnetic field, electric field, exchange interactions, or mechanical stress, among others. During the isothermal
processes, the system remains in thermal equilibrium with the hot and cold reservoirs at temperatures Ty and Ty,
(TH > Tz), while the tuning parameter varies between A; and Aq (Aq > Az).

During the isoparametric stages, the system undergoes temperature exchange at fixed parameter value. Conse-
quently, no work is performed since the tuning parameter remains constant. The cycle representation in Fig. 2 will be
analyzed stage-by-stage. It should be noted that any other intrinsic parameters of the system remain fixed throughout
the cycle A+ B > C+ D — A; only the temperature T and tuning parameter \ are varied.

A -— B.: Isothermal compression at T = Ty. The tuning parameter varies from Ay to Az while the system
maintains thermal equilibrium with the hot reservoir. The heat exchange during this process is given by the
entropy change:

Qa = Ty(Sy, (TH) — Sy, (Tx)] (7)

B — C: Isoparametric cooling at constant 1 = A,. Decoupling from the hot reservoir and cooling to Ty, decreases
the internal energy without work performance:

Qc = Uy, (Tr) — Uy, (TH) (8)

C-—D.: Isothermal expansion at T = T;. The tuning parameter returns from A; to Ay while the system
equilibrates with the cold reservoir. The associated heat transfer is:

Qev =T1[Sa, (Tr) — $2, (T1)] (9)
FIG. 2: Schematic representation of the Stirling cycle in terms of entropy and the control parameter 4. Segments AB and
CD correspond to the isothermal processes at T = Ty and T = Ty, respectively. The entropy at point A (D) is lower than at
point B (C), and the cycle proceeds in a counterclockwise direction.

D — A: Isoparametric heating at constant \ = Aq. Heating from Ty, to Ty increases the internal energy, again
without work being performed:

Qpa = Uy, (TH) — Ur, (Tr) (10)

From the first law of thermodynamics, the internal energy variation over a closed cycle is zero:

dU =dQ+dw SO Eidpi So pid, => pau =o. (11)

For this cycle, the total net work equals the sum of heat exchanges during each stage:

W = Qapt+ QacotQcn+Qna=Qu+ Qt. (12)

We adopt the sign convention where positive (negative) heat @ indicates that the system absorbs (releases) heat.
For the cycle shown in Fig. 2, the net heat exchanges are Qy = Qag +Qpa > 0 (absorbed from hot reservoir) and
Qt = Qcv + Qzc < 0 (released to cold reservoir). Similarly, positive (negative) work W indicates work done by (on)
the system.

In the context of a heat engine performing useful work, the Stirling engine efficiency 17 is defined as the ratio between
the total net work and the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir:

Qu+Qr _ W _,_|@cn+Qze
7 Qu Qu Qap+Qpa
Depending on the system’s fundamental properties, the signs of work and heat may differ from those of a conventional
heat engine. By reversing the cycle direction, a refrigerator can be obtained where previously there was an engine.
Similarly, by applying substantial work to the system, it can extract heat from the cold reservoir and function as a
heat pump. Furthermore, within the formalism of quantum thermodynamics, two additional exotic regimes exist: the
accelerator and the heater. All these operational modes are summarized in the heat-work sign table in Table I.

B. Quantum Stirling Engines at Quantum Criticality

While the general Stirling cycle shown in Fig. 2 works effectively for a system at quantum criticality as in Fig. 1,
a specific diagram is necessary to illustrate the exact behavior. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the thermodynamic cycle
is performed by sweeping the control parameter from the QCP Ait (Fig. 1) to a high parameter value Ay, with

ding to the ground state at the higher temperature. Similarly, if the

high field is selected as the control parameter, the cycle can be defined by assigning either the initial or the final point

to coincide with the QCP.

critical value Acrit denotes the QCP. Segments AB and CD correspond to the isothermal processes at Ty = Ty, +6 and Tr,
respectively. The entropy satisfies Sg = Sc = gerit, while Sp = go and S,4 may include contributions from gi. The heat

exchange along BC vanishes (Qgc = 0), whereas

Qpa is proportional to the temperature difference between reservoirs.

The thermal reservoirs are considered to be close in temperature, with (Iq — T,)/Tu = 6/TH < 1, so that Ty
may be written as Ty = Tz + 6 to leading order. This condition ensures that when the system is at the QCP, the
entropy is dominated by the ground-state degeneracy, with negligible population of excited states. Consequently, the

internal energy at the critical point becomes
since they are both small and closely spaced.

emperature-independent and constant for both reservoir temperatures,

Additionally, the low-temperature regime guarantees that at high tuning parameter Ay, predominantly the ground
state is populated, while the first excited state remains scarcely occupied and higher levels are empty. The energy

gap A between the ground and first excited s

ates determines the characteristic energy scale, and the internal energy

at both low and high temperatures is governed by this parameter. Later in this section, the case of a reduced

energy gap will be considered, where thermal

For the present discussion, in the very low-

occupation of the first excited state becomes non-negligible even at low

(A) Point A (Aq,Ti): The internal energy approaches the ground state energy €9, and the entropy corresponds

solely to the ground state degeneracy:

US (Ln) ~ e,

SX” (Ti) = kp In (qo). (14)
(B) Point B (Aait, TZ): Despite the higher temperature, the internal energy remains at the critical ground state
energy, and the entropy reflects the QCP degeneracy. The thermal energy is insufficient to significantly populate
excited states:

U®) (Ty) = nd S® (Ty) = ke ln (gerit)- (15)

Acrit €ground? Aerit

(C) Point C (Acit,,): The internal energy remains constant at the critical ground state value, and the entropy
again reflects the QCP degeneracy:

Use (TH UO (Tr) = oan SO (Tr) = ke ln (gerit)- (16)

crit €ground? Acrit

(D) Point D (Ay,Tz,): The entropy is determined by the ground state degeneracy at Ay, and the internal energy
approaches €9, as the temperature cannot populate excited states:

US? (Lt) ~ €0, SY (Lt) = ke n (go). (17)

Thus, using the thermodynamic functions presented in Eqs. (14-17), the heat exchanges for each stage of the Stirling
cycle are explicitly analyzed:

Qav = Tu[ 82) (Tu) ~ $89 (Dn)] = koi l( goss) —In(go)] = kT n (22), (18)
Qzo = UO (Tr) — UM (Tu) = 0, (19)
Dome Ee Eseezes 1) - 5 (T)| = = kgT1([In(go) — n(gerit)| = —ke Ti In (“*). (20)
Qva = US? (Tu) — UP) (T1) =0. (21)

Thus, the work performed in the Stirling cycle can be expressed as the sum of the exchanged heats. Assuming that
the hot reservoir is set as Ty = Ty, + 6, the net work becomes

W =kp(Ty — Tz) In (*). (22)
W =kpéln (=) . (23)

where gerit and go denote the ground-state degeneracies at the critical and high-field points, respectively, and 6
represents the temperature difference between the reservoirs. By construction, the engine efficiency is identical to the
Carnot efficiency.

kpTy In (@ ) — kpT;, In (= )

Notably, while ideal Stirling cycles reach Carnot efficiency only in the presence of a perfect regenerator, in Eq. (24)
no regenerator is required. At low temperatures, the thermal population remains confined within the degenerate
ground-state manifold, representing a distinct quantum advantage over engines operating with classical working
substances.

If the machine operates as a refrigerator, either by reversing the cycle direction or due to intrinsic system properties,
the coefficient of performance (COP ,) can be defined as an analog to the engine efficiency. However, unlike the
efficiency, the COP has no upper bound. For this analysis, the cycle in Fig. 3 is reversed, consequently inverting the
labels identifying the stages. The resulting coefficient satisfies the Carnot refrigerator condition:

Similarly, if the machine operates as a heat pump, the coefficient of performance (COP yp) is defined as the ratio
between the heat delivered to the hot reservoir and the net work performed on the system. In our cycle, the heat
absorbed by the hot reservoir corresponds to Qs, while the net work is the sum of all heat exchanges. Thus, the

In the following subsection, the effect of a small energy gap is analyzed, where the first excited state can be thermally
occupied even for a small temperature increment 6.

C. Thermal Excitations and Small-Gap Effects

To evaluate the effect of higher energy-level occupation on the system’s work and heat exchange, we consider
that partial population of the first excited state occurs only when the system is in contact with the hot reservoir at
temperature Ty = Ty +6 and high fixed parameter Ay, corresponding to point A in Fig. 3. This contribution is
treated as a small perturbation, since the other thermodynamic points remain unaffected. The low temperature T;,
ensures that only the ground state is populated at point D.

Accordingly, the correction is localized at point A and can be described using an effective two-level model within
the canonical ensemble, where the energy gap A in Fig. 1 is sufficiently small to allow partial excitation of the first
excited state:

£0 — sot

Zu (T) = goe FPP + gre *87, A=€,~ 6. (31)

Where g; are the degeneracies of the ground-state €9 an0Qd the first excited state €1, respectively. Using the
standard relations of the canonical ensemble and defining A as the energy gap between the first excited state and the
groundstate, the Helmholtz free energy of the system becomes:

— £0 __A

From the free energy, the internal energy can be calculated, and the entropy can be expressed using the corresponding

Legendre transformation for the internal energy as

OnZ),

Uy, (T) = kel? ar

TSr4(T) =Ury (T) — Fy, (7). (34)

AH

Expressing the entropy in Eq. (34) in terms of the internal and Helmholtz free energies is convenient, as only the
latter contributes across the cycle. Consequently, the perturbation affects solely the heat exchange at point A. The
heat Qaz of the first isothermal process can thus be written in terms of the Helmholtz and internal energies, while
the isoparametric process at the high control parameter, associated with the heat Q4p, is given by the difference in
internal energies at fixed \;;. At point D, the internal energy corresponds exclusively to the ground state due to the
sufficiently low temperature. Thus, the expressions for the heats involved are given by

Qap = keTy In (Gerit) — TH $y, (Tu), Qap =U), (TH) — €0. (35)

Consequently, in the limit A >> kgTy, this term is negligible. Therefore, the heat exchanges for the complete cycle
are:

Qap = Tu [SX (Cx) — 8 (Tn)] = ke Tin bm (Geri) — US) (Ln) + FX (Ta) (36)
Qac = UX (Pr) — UX (Tn) = 0, (37)
Qcp =Tr [sX? (1) = sO (11)] = kpTy [In(go) — InGerit)] = —keTr In (@*) , (38)
Qpa = US (Ta) ~ US) (Fi) = US) (Ear) ~ eo. 9)

The work in the Stirling cycle is calculated as the sum of all heat exchanges. As seen, the internal energy terms
cancel, yielding a contribution corresponding to the free energy component:

W =kpT, ln (“*) + kpTy In (Gert) + BO (Lu) — €0. (40)
By explicitly substituting the free energy from Eq.(33) into Eq.(40), the terms associated with the ground state cancel
out, yielding

Jerit No -me
W =kpéln[ — ) —kp(T1 +6) m[1+—e tert |. (41)
90 90
It is observed that, in the limit of a large energy gap, the previous result from Eq. (24) is recovered with an additional
contribution at the Carnot limit. However, the thermal population of the first excited state reduces the useful work.
To investigate its impact, the system efficiency is now analyzed from Eq. (13) substituting the heat terms from

Eqs. (36-39). The resulting expression can be written as follows

kpTy In (=)
90

kpTy In (“*) — kpTy ln (1 4 eet )
90 90

(42)

n=l—

To account for the correction introduced by the heat term Q4p to Carnot efficiency, Eq. (24) is expanded as a power

series. Since the critical point involves the degeneracies go and g1, the condition in( + ae-A/(knTu)) < In( 4) is
always satisfied, enabling a geometric expansion. The result can then be expressed in terms of the Carnot efficiency

as

(43)

Inclusion of higher thermal populations reduces the maximum attainable efficiency, keeping it strictly below the Carnot
limit. This reduction arises because part of the thermal energy is expended in populating excited states rather than
contributing to useful work. In the limit of a large energy gap and/or sufficiently low temperature, these corrections
vanish, and the Carnot efficiency is asymptotically recovered.

IV. GENERAL FRAMEWORK FOR QUANTUM STIRLING CYCLES: VALIDATION AND
APPLICATION TO CRITICAL SYSTEMS WITH FIBONACCI-TYPE DEGENERACIES

Having established the theoretical framework for both ideal critical cycles and systems with a small energy gap, we
now validate these models against quantum systems with QCPs reported in the literature. This includes quantum
critical systems, quantum heat engines that reach Carnot efficiency, and exactly solvable models. We examine a range
of systems with diverse interactions to validate the derived formulas through postdictions of previously reported
results. Furthermore, we provide new predictions for systems exhibiting nontrivial degeneracies, such as the critical
point degeneracies in open and closed quantum Ising chains, which are characterized by Fibonacci and Lucas numbers.

A. Validation Across Reported Quantum Systems

1. Two spin-1/2 systems

Two-qubit systems have been widely studied in condensed matter and quantum information literature, often with
different types of interactions. To provide a unified framework for these cases, we introduce a generalized XXZ
Hamiltonian that collects the most relevant contributions, written in natural units of the exchange constant J:

The Hamiltonian in Eq. (44) incorporates several fundamental interactions within the standard spin-operator formal-
ism. The antiferromagnetic exchange constant J couples nearest-neighbor spins through a Heisenberg XX interaction,
where the spin operators S; = (S7,$/,S7) satisfy the usual angular momentum commutation relations. The total
spin components are defined as Se. => yoy se with a € {x,y,z}. The J, term couples the z-components of both
spins, and for J, = J the system reduces to the isotropic Heisenberg XXX model. The Zeeman term, proportional
to B,, corresponds to a homogeneous magnetic field applied along the z axis. The uniaxial magnetic anisotropy
Ky, couples to the square of the total y-component of spin. Finally, the Dzyaloshinskii—Moriya interaction (DMI),
parameterized by D, introduces an antisymmetric exchange that breaks inversion symmetry.

By selectively enabling or suppressing interaction terms, previously reported two-qubit models can be recovered as
limiting cases of the general Hamiltonian. This construction provides a unified framework within which our formula can
be benchmarked against diverse quantum configurations operating as Stirling engines. The corresponding parameter
sets and the quantitative agreement are summarized in Table II.

quantum Stirling engine. The table lists the parameter sets considered, together with the corresponding degeneracies, simulated
work output (Weim), and the predictions of the analytical expression (Wformula). Temperatures and work are given in units of
kp, while the mobile parameter is expressed in exchange-constant units.

Table IT summarizes several interaction configurations of the Hamiltonian in Eq.(44) along with their corresponding
references. The mobile parameter varies between models, though the magnetic field is most commonly employed as
the control variable. Thermal reservoirs are set at low and closely spaced temperatures. The simulated work output

Wasim, given in units of kg, is obtained from full numerical calculations and compared with the analytical prediction of
Eq.(23), which depends solely on degeneracies and temperature differences for systems operating at Carnot efficiency.

In the case of the pure Heisenberg XX model, Purkait and Biswas [29 identified a QCP at B = 1 with a twofold
critical degeneracy. For B = 3, where the ground state is non-degenerate, and temperatures Ty, = 0.15 and Ty = 0.25,
the system reaches Carnot efficiency, and the simulated work matches precisely the prediction of Eq. (23).

Introducing a planar anisotropy of K, = 0.5, Araya et al. [33] showed that the critical field shifts to B ~ V2
while preserving the twofold degeneracy. With B = 3 as the high-field parameter and temperatures T;, = 0.12 and
Ty = 0.20, the work remains proportional to In 2, again in perfect agreement with the formula.

The combined effect of a homogeneous field and a Dzyaloshinskii—Moriya interaction was analyzed by Pili et al. [35].
For D = 1/2, the critical point shifts to B = 1.06, while the ground-state degeneracy remains unchanged. Operating
the cycle with B = 4, T; = 0.10, and Ty = 0.20, the work continues to follow Eq. (23), demonstrating its robustness
even away from the strict critical regime.

Cruz et al. [26] investigated an experimental dinuclear metal complex modeled as a two-qubit system with only
nearest-neighbor interactions. Measurements of work, absorbed and released heat, and efficiency were found to be
consistent with theoretical predictions. For the purposes of this manuscript, parameters around J; ~ —2.75 with
reservoir temperatures T, = 20 K and Ty = 25 K are considered. To further approach the critical regime at J = 0,
the interaction is extended down to Jy = —1, slightly beyond the values reported in the experiment. In this range,
the work output approaches the Carnot limit, though the deviation from Eq. (23) remains on the order of 107° due
to the high-field point not coinciding exactly with the fourfold critical degeneracy. Extending the parameter closer to
J ~ 0 restores agreement with errors as small as 10~!°, although such conditions would not correspond to physically
realizable parameters in an endoreversible cycle.

2. Nth spin-s system

The two-qubit benchmarks establish quantitative agreement between the analytical expression in Eq. (23) and simu-
lated work across distinct interaction channels. The next step is to probe robustness beyond the minimal local Hilbert
space and to assess the role of topology. This requires moving to higher on-site spin and to extended geometries
(open chains vs. rings), for which a compact many-body description is provided below.

Recent studies demonstrate that topology, system size, and on-site spin magnitude significantly influence quantum
thermal machine performance. To capture these effects systematically, we introduce a generalized Heisenberg-type
Hamiltonian for chains of N spin-s sites:

N-1 N
AD. =I S28: Sigs + BSing + Ky (Sts) +820 (87). (45)
t=1 t=1

This Hamiltonian (45) integrates the key interactions previously established: Heisenberg XXX exchange coupling
(J), Zeeman field (B), easy-plane anisotropy (K,), and single-ion anisotropy (Kz) that promotes alignment of in-
dividual spins along the z-axis. When the summation is extended to N terms and periodic boundary conditions
are imposed (Sy41 = $1), the Hamiltonian can describe either open chains or closed rings, enabling systematic
exploration of topological effects on work extraction and efficiency in quantum Stirling cycles.

This framework provides a unified foundation for analyzing how spin magnitude (s), geometry, and interaction
symmetry shape the performance of quantum thermal devices. Table III compares representative cases of quantum
Stirling engines with the analytical expression in Eq. (23) at Carnot efficiency. The results show consistent agreement
between simulations and theory across different geometries, interaction types, and system sizes, with the magnetic
field acting as the control parameter and thermal reservoirs maintained at low, closely spaced temperatures.

Castorene et al. [34] investigated isotropic Heisenberg XXX chains and rings of three qubits with a uniaxial
anisotropy along the y-axis, using the magnetic field as the control parameter. As discussed earlier, such anisotropy
shifts the critical field without altering the degeneracy structure. For a critical field at B ~ 2.41 and a high-field
point at B = 3.5, with reservoirs at T, = 0.15 and Ty = 0.25, the work output followed Eq. (23) in both geometries.
Notably, the ring configuration exhibited a larger work output, which can be attributed to the additional translational
symmetry at zero field, yielding one extra critical degeneracy compared to the open chain.

In a different study, Castorene et al. [24] analyzed isotropic spin-1 dimers with single-ion anisotropy along the
z-axis and an external magnetic field of opposite sign, which introduces frustration in the energy levels. Specific
anisotropy values induce either a triple degeneracy point (TDP) at K, = —2/3 or double degeneracy points (DDPs)
at K, = —1/10, each associated with critical magnetic fields. For instance, at B = 4/3 the system exhibits a TDP,

TABLE III: Comparison of the generalized spin-s chain Hamiltonian (45) for different interaction configurations and system
sizes N, operating as quantum Stirling engines. The table reports the parameter sets, critical degeneracies, simulated work
output (Wsim), and the predictions of Eq. (23), showing quantitative agreement with results reported in the literature. Tem-
peratures and work are given in units of kg, while the mobile parameter is expressed in exchange-constant units.

while at B ~ 1.90 one of the DDPs emerges. Stirling cycles performed with By = 3.0 and reservoirs at Ty, = 0.05
and Ty = 0.10 yielded work outputs proportional to In3 and In 2, respectively, in full agreement with Eq. (23).

Overall, these results highlight the robustness of the proposed framework across diverse quantum critical scenarios.
The analytical expression for the work remains valid not only for two-qubit systems with additional interactions
such as Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya coupling or planar anisotropy, but also for extended configurations involving higher
spins, distinct topologies (chains and rings), and complex local anisotropies. This universality underscores the broad
applicability of Eq. (23) to quantum thermal devices operating near criticality.

To further demonstrate the generality of the approach, an additional analysis of a non-Heisenberg spin model, the
Lipkin—Meshkoy—Glick (LMG) model, was carried out in Appendix A. The results confirm that the proposed formula
remains accurate even for systems characterized by collective spin interactions and more intricate energy landscapes.

B. Quantum Ising model at criticality with Fibonacci-Lucas Degeneracies

The scalability of the work formula can be addressed by considering systems with an increasing number of interacting
particles. A natural case study is the quantum antiferromagnetic Ising model in the z direction, one of the simplest
many-body systems that exhibits a non-trivial QCP. The model is studied under a longitudinal magnetic field applied
along the z axis, which drives the transition and enables exploration of how critical degeneracies scale with system
size. The Hamiltonian of this system is given by

N-1

N
H=JS~ 9757,,4+BS° 83. (46)
+= 1 t=I
12

This Hamiltonian describes a chain of N qubits with nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions. The exchange
constant J denotes the isotropic antiferromagnetic coupling constant between adjacent spins (J > 0), while S$?
represents the Pauli operator along the z direction. The longitudinal external magnetic field B is applied along the
positive z axis and, in physical units, is given by B = jxpg.H, where ug is the Bohr magneton and g, the Landé
g-factor. For convenience, B is expressed in units of the exchange constant. Extending the summation to N terms
with the identification Shaq = = $2 imposes periodic boundary conditions, thereby mapping the open chain system
onto a closed spin ring.

In this framework, the system exhibits a QCP at finite field, which occurs when the ratio B/J = 1. Such criticality
arises for both open chains and closed rings of arbitrary length N > 3.

Correspondingly, the ground-state energy at the critical field and beyond, with respect to the magnetic field, is
given by [40]

NB
deg) =F Ze. (47)

For periodic boundary conditions, the factor accompanying the exchange constant J extends as (N — 1) + N, while
the magnetic field term remains unchanged. This implies that the open-chain geometry possesses a lower ground-state
energy than the closed ring.

Accordingly, the Stirling cycle shown in Fig. 2 is implemented by driving the system from the quantum critical point
at A, = B/J = 1 to a higher magnetic field \y = B/J = 3. The process is simulated within the canonical ensemble
over the complete set of 2% energy levels for both the open-chain and closed-ring geometries. This framework allows
a direct comparison between the numerically computed work outputs (wena, Wier! and the analytical prediction
from Eq. (23), valid for arbitrary system size N. To establish this connection, it is necessary to determine how the
critical ground-state degeneracy associated with the ground-state energy of Eq. (47) scales with N. In this context,
recent studies [40, 41] showed that, for one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Ising model, the degeneracy at the QCP
follows the Fibonacci sequence Fy, defined recursively as Fy = Fy—1+F'y—2 with Fy = F, = 1. In contrast, periodic
boundary conditions give rise to a nontrivial degeneracy governed by the Lucas sequence, which can be expressed in
terms of the Fibonacci numbers as Ly = Fy+1 + Fy-1. Using Binet’s formula, both sequences can be written in
closed form through the golden ratio y = (1 + V5)/2:

p® —(-p-t)8
V5 >

Thus, performing the Stirling cycle from the QCP at B/J = 1, where the Fibonacci—Lucas degeneracies of Eq. (48)
apply, to a high-field configuration at B/J = 3 with a non-degenerate ground state yields

Fy Ly =X +(-1l)%—™. (48)

N _ (_,»-1\)N
wo. knsn(£ a. ) ) (49)
Weontinta = kedIn (eo — (—et)"). (50)

These previous expressions can be treated for the case of small system sizes N, observing that the work of both
the chain and the ring does not scale linearly with N, reflecting a genuinely quantum effect that contrasts with
the classical thermodynamic expectation of extensivity. Specifically, Eq. (49) shows that the work for the chain is
proportional to the N-th Fibonacci number, while for Eq. (50) depict that the ring follows the N-th Lucas number,
with the chain producing less work.

In the asymptotic limit N > 1, the inverse golden-ratio (p~’) terms can be neglected, yielding the approximate
expressions

Eqs. (51-52) show that both cases scale linearly with N, but the chain includes a constant offset of —In V5,
highlighting a residual distinction between quantum thermodynamics and its classical counterpart. However, in the
thermodynamic limit N >> 1, the constant term becomes negligible, and both chain and ring topologies recover

with results reported in the literature for the classical Ising model.

Finally, Fig. 4 summarizes the main results, displaying the quantum Stirling work W as a function of the system size

theoretical framework.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have performed a comprehensive thermodynamic analysis of quantum systems exhibiting a QCP induced by a
control parameter at zero temperature, using the canonical ensemble formalism. From these quantities, a quantum
Stirling cycle was constructed under sufficiently low temperatures such that only the ground state remains significantly
populated. The cycle begins at the QCP, characterized by critical degeneracy, and ends at a higher control parameter
where the ground state becomes energetically isolated from the excited manifold.

This framework yields analytical expressions for the finite net work and Carnot-like efficiency in terms of the tem-
perature difference between the thermal reservoirs and the ratio between the degeneracies of the critical and isolated
ground state. The role of finite-temperature effects was also examined, revealing that partial thermal occupation of
excited states reduces both useful work and maximum efficiency due to energy redistribution within the system.

The proposed work expression was validated through postdictions and predictions across diverse spin-s Heisenberg
systems, incorporating Dzyaloshinskii—-Moriya interactions, uniform magnetic fields, uniaxial anisotropies, and single-
ion anisotropies. These results confirm the robustness of the formulation for systems operating near the Carnot
regime.

Finally, the extensivity of the work output was analyzed for one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Ising systems with
open-chain and closed-ring topologies of length N. The work was found to scale with the logarithm of the Nth
Fibonacci number for open chains and with the logarithm of the Nth Lucas number for rings, indicating a higher
useful work in closed geometries for small N. In the thermodynamic limit, both configurations converge to a linear
dependence on N, thereby recovering the classical extensivity of the work.

Appendix A: Applications in the Lipkin—Meshkov—Glick model

The Lipkin—Meshkov—Glick (LMG) model constitutes a paradigmatic framework in quantum many-body physics,
extensively investigated in various experimental platforms such as Bose-Einstein condensates and trapped-ion sys-
tems [25]. Recent studies have shown that a quantum Stirling cycle employing the LMG model as its working substance
can, under appropriate conditions, reach Carnot efficiency.

The model describes a system of N collectively interacting spins subjected to a uniform magnetic field, incorporating
both symmetric and anisotropic spin-spin couplings. Its general Hamiltonian can be written as

Hime = S. +V (S2 — 52) + w (Ss? - 82), (Al)

where Sy = $ a o* denotes the collective spin operators, and of are the Pauli matrices acting on the i-th spin. The
first term represents the Zeeman interaction with an external magnetic field of strength ¢, while S? = $? + S? +S?
corresponds to the total spin magnitude. The coefficients V and W quantify the anisotropic components of the
collective spin-spin coupling.

It is convenient to define the following dimensionless control parameters:

& Xo W+V W-V
a =, = x . A2
2 WN 2 TW aa
In the isotropic case y = 1, the Hamiltonian simplifies to
. 2r ,
Hime = -<2 (S? — $2) — 2A5.. (A3)

By setting Ao = 1, the energy eigenvalues take the compact form

2 NA\* Ne, yo
E(M) rc (a1 5 ) 5 (1+ A”) -1, (A4)
where M assumes discrete values M € [—N/2, N/2].

This collective-spin model fulfills the general requirements for a quantum working substance discussed in the main
text. Accordingly, the thermodynamic formalism developed earlier can be directly applied. For N = 3 and N = 4
the corresponding quantum Stirling cycles are constructed from the energy spectrum given in Eq. (A4), where the
parameter \ acts as the external thermodynamic variable controlling the energy-level structure throughout the cycle.

parameter sets and system sizes N = 3 and N = 4, respectively. The table lists the control parameters A; and Ay, the reservoir
temperatures T; and Ty, the critical degeneracy gcrit, the ground-state degeneracy go, and the corresponding work output
obtained from simulations (Wsim) compared with the analytical prediction of Eq. (23). Quantities are expressed in units of kg
for temperature and work, while \ is given in dimensionless form. Results show quantitative agreement with Ref. [25].

The excellent agreement between the simulated and analytical results, evidenced by the negligible relative error,
confirms the consistency and reliability of our approach. Moreover, for the parameter sets presented in Table IV, the
quantum Stirling engine based on the Lipkin-Meshkov—Glick model operates at the Carnot efficiency limit, demon-
strating the thermodynamic optimality of the system under the specified conditions. This result further highlights
the versatility of the proposed formulation, which remains valid beyond Heisenberg-type spin models and successfully
extends to collectively interacting systems such as the LMG model.
