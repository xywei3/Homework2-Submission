Abstract

We revisited the scenario of a resonant enhancement in the oscillation probability due to an interaction potential between
neutrinos and dark matter with the novelty of the inclusion of the generalized uncertainty principle. It is shown that a
new resonant conversion appears at higher energies. This effect could be tested with future neutrino data as new dips

in the ultrahigh energy neutrino flux.

1. Introduction

Neutrino oscillation is a pure quantum mechanical ef-
fect. First proposed by Pontecorvo [1, 2, 3, 4], the neutrino
oscillations are the effect where the flavor of the neutrino
changes while traveling through space. This phenomenon
was later confirmed by several atmospheric, solar and re-

©, actor neutrino experiments [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. For neutrinos

propagating through a material medium, they experience
a resonance that enhances the oscillation probability. This
enhancement in the neutrino flavor conversion is called
the Mikheyev-Smirnov- Wolfenstein (MSW) effect [10, 11].
The MSW effect could appear not only in the propagation
of neutrinos interacting with baryonic matter through the
weak force. It is possible, for instance, that ultrahigh en-
ergy (UHE) active neutrinos mixed with sterile neutrinos
could operate a MSW effect due to the interaction of neu-
trinos with dark matter as they travel within the galactic
halo, as proposed in [12]. In this work we will re-consider
the scenario proposed in [12] with the inclusion of a gener-
alized uncertainty principle (GUP) [13, 14]. We will show
that GUP induces a second resonance in the oscillation
probability that could lead to observable dips in the UHE
neutrino spectrum. Previous works that include GUP with
neutrino oscillations phenomenology [15, 16, 17] have not
consider UHE neutrinos neither sterile neutrinos or DM
interactions. Thus, the scenario proposed here could be of
interest in those three research areas of neutrino physics.
Furthermore, this work shows a possible connection with
quantum gravity phenomenology since GUP could be seen
as a generic feature of quantum gravity. Indeed, perhaps
the best messengers that could shed light of quantum grav-
ity effect on the highest energies are the neutrinos be-
cause the Universe is impenetrable to photons with en-
ergies larger that 101° eV= 1 PeV.

On the experimental side, it is worthy to recall that
IceCube has observed the flux of electron and 7 UHE neu-
trinos in the energy range from 16 TeV to 2.6 PeV [18]. Ice-
Cube had also detected the muon neutrino flux [19] and the
detection of a cascade of high-energy particle shower that

is consistent with being created at the Glashow resonance
[20], i.e. IceCube has evidence of an electron antineutrino
with energy of 6.3 PeV. In particular, in the electron-muon
neutrino spectrum, there is a hint of a deficit in the 200
TeV - 1 PeV energy range known as dip in ultra-high en-
ergy (UHE) neutrino flux. Diverse explanations has been
proposed to explain such dip [21, 22, 23]. In this work we
will show that if the observed deficit in the UHE neutrino
spectrum is the result of a resonant conversion of UHE ac-
tive neutrinos into sterile neutrinos, then, there should be
a second dip in the spectrum due to the inclusion of a GUP
in neutrino oscillations. The paper is organized as follows:
in section 2 we will derive the survival neutrino probability
of active neutrinos to sterile neutrinos interacting in a dark
matter medium with constant density including GUP. In
section 3 we will derive the resonance condition and show
that there is a second resonance induced by the GUP. We
will draw some conclusions in section 4.

2. Neutrino oscillations with a generalized uncer-
tainty principle

It is commonly suggested that in quantum gravity and
in string theory there exist a minimum observable length
(24, 25]. This minimal length implies a minimal uncer-
tainty in a position measurement giving rise to a modifi-
cation of the Heisenberg algebra which serves as a foun-
dation for a GUP [26]. This modified Heisenberg algebra
can be expressed as a new commutation relation:

(1)

that can be expressed as a canonical commutation relation
[%:, pj] = th for the variables with tilde [17]

[x;, pj] = th (5:3 + Bdijp? + 2Bpip;) ,

= Xi,
pi = (1 + 8B,"),
Po = po=ELE/c, (2)

which also satisfies the canonical dispersion relation po? —
pi? = m?. In terms of this new variables, the squared

4-momentum of the physical quantities can be expressed
as
Po — Bi = Po” — B (1 +26—? + O(8")), (3)

that can be rewritten as

EP = mc! + pe? (1 — 26pc?). (4)
With this new dispersion relation we can start our analysis
of neutrino oscillation. From now on we will use natural
units where c = h = 1. Assuming that the neutrino masses
m are very small m < p, the dispersion relation Eq. (4)
can be expanded as
E~pV1— 26p? + +O(m*). (5)
2p?
Following [12], we consider the simplified scenario of an
active neutrino vy, and one sterile neutrino v, interacting
with a dark matter potential. The evolution equation will

Here, the effective Hamiltonian Heg is given by

where mg is the mass of the active neutrino and m, the
mass of the sterile neutrino. Furthermore, the potential of
interaction in the flavor basis is given by

Vix 0
Vint = , (8)

The potential V,,, takes into account a possible interac-
tion between active neutrinos and dark matter via a boson
with light masses as for instance the one studied in [27] and
it can be computed as [12]

where gy, gy are the coupling constants, m; the mass of
the intermediate boson and Ny, the average number den-
sity of dark matter particles which for the case of the Milky
Way is of the order Ny = 3 x 10716 eV’. Furthermore
we have included the effect of a potential for the inter-
action of sterile neutrinos with dark matter V,,,. This
interaction appears in different extensions of the Standard
Model, where many dark particles, including sterile neu-
trinos, could populate the dark sector and interact among
themselves [28, 29].

The parameters ¢,,, and €s, account for the coupling

strength in terms of the Fermi constant Gp. We have

already neglected the well-known interaction potential of
the active neutrino with ordinary fermions since it is neg-
ligible compared with V,,, and V,,,.The interaction po-
tential V,,¢ has already been studied [30] and is negligible
compared to the other potentials. Therefore, it will be
neglected as well. Finally,

with the angle 9 is the vacuum mixing angle between the

the modified energy dispersion eq. 4, we can diagonalize

given by

and Lj°° = zz. Furthermore |e| = €,,, — €sy and we
have defined Am? = m2, — m? the mass square difference
between the active and the sterile neutrino.

3. Resonant effects with the inclusion of a gener-
alized uncertainty principle

From Eq. 12, it is clear that there is a resonance when
Am? cos 209 = 2Ey/1 — 28E?Grle|Ny] . (14)

3.1. No GUP: Case with B =0

For 6 = 0, with a constant density of dark matter
Ny = ppm /my, there is a resonance at energy given by

_ Am? cos(260)

ER = GalelNy (15)

Motivated by the possible deficit in the UHE neutrino flux
in the energy window 2 x 10'4eV < E < 1PeV, in [12] it
was found that for a mass squared difference between the
active and the sterile neutrino Am? = 107!eV?, a dark
matter particle mass of my = 2 x 10!eV, a coupling |e] =
3 x 10! motivated by the possible interaction of neutrinos
with dark matter with a light intermediate boson [27] and
0) = m/12, then Ep = 1 x 10@eV. Thus active UHE
neutrinos will resonant convert to sterile neutrinos and it
could explain the observed deficit at Ice-Cube detector.

is observed that there is resonance at the energy window 2x 10!4eV <
E < 1Pev.

3.2. The inclusion of GUP in neutrino oscillations: the
case 8B #0

GUP induces a new dispersion relation (see Eq. 4 that
modifies the probability of neutrino oscillations in constant
matter like it is expressed in Eq. 12. This modified proba-
bility has an slightly different resonance condition. Indeed,
for 6 4 0, there are two energies where the resonant con-
version takes place. Eq. 14 can be written with the help
of Ep given by Eq. 15 as

Ev/1—26E? = Er, (16)

that has two solutions:

Enr = (17)

The parameter 3 that appears in the GUP is expected to
be vary small. In particular, if 88E?, < 1 we can approx-
imate Eq. 17 as

1 4
Exip~ ia (1+ (1—48E3)) , (18)

or, in other words, we have one resonance at Exr ~ ER
and a new second energy where there is a resonant conver-
sion at energy

; 1
ENR ~ 54 ~ Er- (19)

In Figure 1 we show the survival probability for the same
parameters as the case discussed in [12] with the addition
of the GUP parameter 6 = 8 x 10-!7GeV~?. It is clear
that there is a new resonance located at Enr.

4. Conclusions

Neutrinos are perhaps the less understood particle within
the standard model. Nevertheless, it is for sure the best
particle to explore the universe at the highest energies. In

particular, UHE neutrinos could play an invaluable role in
the search for a theory of quantum gravity. In this note
we have complemented the scenario of a resonant neutrino
conversion into sterile neutrinos enhanced by the interac-
tion of neutrinos with dark matter [12] by incorporating
a generalized uncertainty principle. We have shown that
GUP induces a second resonance in the neutrino oscilla-
tion probability. This second resonance will be a clear
signature of GUP that will be measurable as a deficit in
