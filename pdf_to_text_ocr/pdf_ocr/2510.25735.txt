The pursuit of universal governing principles is a foundational endeavor in physics, driving

reakthroughs from thermodynamics to general relativity and quantum mechanics. In 1951, Wigner
introduced the concept of a statistical description of energy levels of heavy atoms [1], which led to the
rise of Random Matrix Theory (RMT) in physics [2-5]. The theory successfully captured spectral
properties across a wide range of atomic systems, circumventing the complexities of quantum many-
ody interactions. Rooted in the fundamental principles of stochasticity and symmetry, RMT has
since found applications and revealed universal laws in diverse physical contexts, from quantum field
theory to disordered systems and wireless communications [6]. A particularly compelling application
arises in describing the mathematical structure of the many-body wavefunction of non-interacting
Fermi gases, which underpins a complex spatial organization driven by Pauli’s exclusion principle
7-9]. However, experimental validation of the counting statistics predicted in such systems has
remained elusive. Here, we probe at the single-atom level ultracold atomic Fermi gases made of two
interacting spin states, obtaining direct access to their counting statistics in situ. Our measurements
show that, while the system is strongly attractive, each spin-component is extremely well described
y RMT predictions based on Fredholm determinants. Our results constitutes the first experimental

validation of the Fermi-sphere point process [10, 11] through the lens of RMT, and establishes its

relevance for strongly-interacting systems.

A point process is a mathematical framework for mod-
eling random collections of points in time or space. Each
“point” corresponds to an event, such as the location of
a star in the sky, the firing of a neuron, or the arrival of
a bus. Unlike single random variables, point processes
describe entire configurations of events. The most fun-
damental example is the Poisson point process, where
events occur independently and uniformly, often serving
as a model of complete randomness. More complex pro-
cesses display clustering or repulsion between points, re-
ecting correlations that arise in various systems. Point
rocesses are central in fields ranging from spatial anal-
ysis and telecommunications to neuroscience and quan-
um physics, providing powerful tools for understanding
he structure and dynamics of random events across dis-
ciplines.

In a non-interacting Fermi gas, the underlying point
rocess (governing the probability of finding particles at
given spatial coordinates) is driven by the Pauli exclu-
sion principle. It is a paradigmatic example of a deter-
minantal point process, for which all correlation func-
ions can be expressed as determinants of an elementary
kernel function [5, 12-14]. In two dimensions (2D), ro-
ational symmetry allows to relate the Fermi point pro-
cess with the complex Wishart-Laguerre ensemble [5],
a class of random matrices with applications in quan-
um transport [15], finance [16], multivariate statistics
17], and wireless communications [18]. This mapping

contrasts with the Gaussian ensembles typically associ-
ated with one-dimensional systems, and highlights the
broader relevance of RMT in higher-dimensional quan-
tum gases [10, 11, 19, 20].

Using recently developed continuum quantum gas mi-
croscopy [21-24], we probe at the single-atom level a
degenerate 2D Fermi gas composed of two spin states
with strong attractive interactions. Previous studies
of counting statistics in quantum gases, which con-
cern bosonic systems, probed the momentum [25-27],
time [28], or energy domain [29]. In this work we access
the full counting statistics of each spin-component in
situ, measuring the probability of finding a given num-
ber N of atoms within circular probe regions of space
with a resolution well below the interparticle spacing.
We compare the data to RMT calculations based on
Fredholm determinants. This required extending de-
terminantal point process techniques to finite tempera-
tures, and pushing the precision of calculations to the
level required by experimental data. The experimen-
tally measured statistics agree strikingly well with RMT
theoretical predictions for the ideal gas, at both near-
zero and finite temperature, and without any fitting pa-
rameters.

These observations are not expected a priori: the
system is well in the interacting regime, yet the mea-
sured spatial organization follows the repulsive struc-
ture of eigenvalues of Wishart-Laguerre random matri-
ces, which maps to the ideal Fermi gas. Beyond num-
ber statistics, we measure the distribution of nearest-
neighbor distances, providing a direct observation of the
spacing statistics of a 2D quantum gas. These measure-
ments reveal a smooth crossover from a strongly corre-
lated regime at low temperature (governed by the Pauli

exclusion principle) to a classical, Poissonian regime at
high temperature, where correlations vanish. Our re-
sults represent a unique experimental measurement of
the Fermi-sphere point process [10, 11], and demon-
strate the unexpected relevance of RMT for the study
of strongly interacting quantum systems.

Our experiment begins with a two-component spin
mixture of °Li atoms, prepared with equal spin popula-
tions and confined to a single plane by a laser-induced
trap that provides strong confinement along the verti-
cal z-direction. In the ry-plane, the atoms experience a
nearly harmonic potential with slow spatial variations,
allowing the use of the local density approximation to
extract properties of the homogeneous system [7]. At
the ultracold temperatures relevant here, interactions
occur exclusively via s-wave collisions, which are for-
bidden between identical fermions due to the Pauli ex-
clusion principle, and thus only arise between atoms in
different spin states. These inter-spin interactions are
attractive and tunable via a magnetic field near a Fesh-
bach resonance located at 690 G.

The interaction strength is characterized by the di-
mensionless parameter 7 = log(kpa), where kp = V4rn
is the Fermi wavevector (with n the density of one
spin-component), and a the two-dimensional scattering
length (see Methods). The weakly attractive regime,
7 > 1, corresponds to a BCS superfluid at low tempera-
ture. In this work, we study various samples, with inter-
actions ranging from extremely weak to relatively strong
attraction (7 ~ 20 to 7 2), and reduced temperatures
ranging from T/Tp ~ 0.1 to 20, where Tp = 20nh?/mkp
is the Fermi temperature and m the atomic mass (see
Refs. [30] and [31] for details on the preparation).

We probe the system using continuum quantum gas
microscopy, which allows for single-atom-resolved imag-
ing in continuous space. This technique involves freezing
the atomic motion by rapidly switching on a deep opti-
cal lattice and then illuminating the atoms with cooling
light to induce fluorescence while holding them in indi-
vidual lattice sites [21, 22]. Before applying the lattice,

we remove one spin component, enabling measurement
of the spatial distribution of a single spin species. A
typical experimental image is shown in Fig.1b, where
each atom is resolved with > 99.5% fidelity, providing
pristine access to the system’s counting statistics. We
acquire on the order of 700 to 1400 images, depending
on the preparation, and extract the probability Py of
finding N atoms within a circular region of radius R.
In Fig.lc, we show the measured probabilities
Py(kpR) for N = 0 to 5 for a representative sample
with intermediate interaction strength (7 = 3.7(2)) and
reduced temperature T/Tp = 0.15(1). We compare our
measurements to theoretical predictions from the Fred-
holm determinant formalism. The kernel associated to
2D free fermions is equal to the field correlation func-
tion K(a,a2’) = (Wi(x)U(ax’)) with Vi(x) and U(x)
the fermionic field operators. We write K(a,a’) =
k2K(p = kpa, p’ = kpa’), and leverage rotational sym-

metry to obtain an angular decomposition of K using
polar coordinates p = (p, ¢) [20]:

T/Te = 0.15(1). Data is compared to theoretical predic-

totic behavior Po(r — 00) x err (black dash-dotted line).
(b) The measured nearest-neighbour spacing distribution is

behavior of the theoretical prediction at T = 0.

(see Methods for more details). This Fredholm determi-
nant depends on temperature through the Fermi factor
in Eq. (2). At zero temperature, this determinant co-
incides with the one describing the fluctuations of the
smallest eigenvalues of large random matrices belong-
ing to the Wishart-Laguerre ensemble of RMT, indexed
by the angular momentum ¢ [5]. In the formula for
Py(r) (Eq. (3)), the product over ¢ arises from the in-
dependence of the fluctuations in each ¢-sector. At very
high temperature T/T > 1, our result crosses over to
the expected distribution for a Poisson point process
PPoisson(p) — semen 4.

We find excellent agreement between our measure-
ments and the above predictions with no fitting param-
eters, using the independently determined temperature
T/T = 0.15(1) as sole input. A similar degree of agree-
ment is observed for other interaction strengths consid-

ered in this work, including 7 = 7.8(5) and 7 = 2.1(2),
though the latter exhibits the onset of small but mea-
surable deviations (see Extended Data). These re-
sults reveal an unexpected breadth of applicability of
RMT, since its predictions can accurately describe spa-
tial statistics of a Fermi gas well in the interacting
regime.

In Fig. 2a, we focus on the hole probability Po, which
quantifies the likelihood of finding no particles within a
given region of radius R. This is a key quantity for
the description of spatial statistics, which character-
ize the rigidity of the Fermi gas under Pauli exclusion,
with connections to the spacing distribution. The com-
parison of the experimentally measured P(r) to finite-
temperature predictions obtained from Fredholm deter-
minant shows excellent agreement over several orders
of magnitude in probability, down to values as small as
10-4. The precision of our experimental data in the tail
of the distribution allows us to resolve the minute de-
viations from the predicted asymptotic form at T = 0,
Po(r) ~ e7"*/9, valid for large radii [20].

Figure 2b shows the distribution of the nearest-
neighbor spacing (NNS) s, a central quantity in the the-
ory of random point pro s. The spacing s denotes
the nearest-neighbor distance rescaled by its average 7,
such that § = 1 by convention. The NNS distribution
lies at the heart of Wigner and Dyson’s seminal work
on eigenvalue statistics in random matrices [1-5]. In
one dimension, an ensemble of non-interacting fermions
can be mapped onto the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble
(GUE) of random matrices [8, 32, 33], where the level
repulsion corresponds to the spatial rigidity of the Fermi
gas, with a spacing distribution well approximated by
the Wigner surmise p(s) ~ s2e~"*" [4].

In two dimensions, where RMT predictions are less es-
tablished [6, 34, 35], important differences emerge [36].
First, the condition p(s = 0) = 0 does not imply level
repulsion, but needs to be replaced by the stronger con-
dition p(s + 07) ~ s® with a > 1. It is indeed straight-
forward to show that for uncorrelated 2D particles (with

Poisson number distribution), p(s) ~ se~**”. Second,
the tail of the NNS distribution in 2D does not follow
a Gaussian decay, but a faster, non-Gaussian form di-
rectly related to the asymptotics of the hole probability.
The experimentally measured NNS clearly deviates from
the Poisson prediction, exhibiting strong short-range re-
pulsion consistent with p(s) ~ s?, which is the expected
low temperature scaling s¢+! with d the dimension of
the system [36]. For relatively small spacings (s < 1)
we have also derived the approximate result:

fe

p(s) & “y 892(sF), (5)

where go is the reduced density-density correlation func-
tion (see Methods). Using this relation and the mea-
sured gp (see Extended Data), we obtain an independent
measurement of the NNS at short distance, yielding ad-
ditional data points (see Fig. 2b). The NNS distribu-
tion also displays the expected faster decay at large s,
compared to the 1D case. We compare our data to the
NNS distribution computed from the finite-temperature

Fredholm determinant calculations, which is given by
p(s) = -7 4s sr, Where P(r) is the probability of

finding no atom in a disk of radius r conditioned on one
atom being at its center, for which we have derived an

histograms of measured spacings, but we only show the mean probability of each bin for legibility. Dashed lines show the zero

exact expression (see Methods). For accurate compar-
ison, we also compute the histogram derived from the
theoretical result using the same binning as the data.
We find very good agreement without any free parame-
ters. This constitutes, to the best of our knowledge, the
first direct measurement of the spacing statistics in a 2D
quantum gas. In ultracold systems, the spacing statis-
tics of a 1D point process was observed in the collisional
spectra of Erbium atoms [29].

We now turn to the study of the temperature depen-
dence of the counting statistics of our system. The hole
robability and the NNS characterize the rigidity of the
Fermi gas. Our ability to prepare samples of variable
degeneracy [30] allows us to witness the breakdown of
his rigidity as these observables transition to a classical
behavior. In order to disentangle interaction and tem-
erature effects, we consider samples prepared with van-
ishingly weak attraction with 7 = 20.5(10). All samples
are initially evaporatively cooled in the optical trap, and
contain ~ 150 atoms per spin state. After a thermaliza-
ion time of 1.6 s, the trap depth is adiabatically ramped
up to ~ 650nK, corresponding to a vertical trapping
frequency w, = 2m x 3.0(1) kHz. We then modulate the
rap intensity with a frequency ~ 2w, and a relative
amplitude of 5% for a variable time. Following this
controlled heating, the atoms are left to thermalize for
.88, before one of the two spin components is expelled.
The resulting single-component systems realize (quasi-)
;wo-dimensional non-interacting Fermi gases, with fixed
rapping parameters and similar atom numbers, and a

final temperature set by the modulation time. We ad-
ditionally prepare a classical (hot) gas to serve as a ref-
erence (see Ref. [30] for more details).

In the vertical direction the atomic motion is quan-
tized, with a quantum of vibration corresponding to a
temperature scale T, = hw,/kp = 143(3)nK. For the
previously discussed (interacting) samples, T, Tp, the
interaction energy, and T’, were chosen to ensure an oc-
cupation of the excited z-level states below 4%, such
that the samples could be considered essentially 2D. As
we now explore a large dynamic range in temperature,
we consequently expect the fraction p, in the v-th ex-
cited z—level to increase with temperature. The system
can then be described as a superposition of independent
2D systems with Fermi temperature p,T and Fermi
wavevector ,/pykr. In this case the theoretical predic-
tion for the hole probability for quasi-2D free fermions
becomes (see Methods):

PPP (r,t) = Il Po (rV/pv,t/pv) ’ (6)

v>0

with Po(r,t) the 2D result given in Eq. (3). We obtain
similar formulas for P?? (r,t) for N > 1.

In Fig. 3, we report the measurement of the proba-
bilities to find N = 0,...,4 in a circle of radius R, and
the next-nearest-neighbor p(s), for a selection of sam-
ples. For each reported quantity we find again excellent
quantitative agreement with the predictions based on
Fredholm determinant without any fitting parameters.
These results provide an accurate measurement of the
smooth crossover from the correlated regime driven by
Pauli’s exclusion at low temperature to a Poissonian
regime at high temperature.

We have experimentally investigated number and
spacing statistics in 2D degenerate Fermi gases with
continuum quantum gas microscopy. The near perfect
detection allowed us to finely measure the behavior
of the hole probability and nearest-neighbor spacing
in an interacting Fermi gas near zero temperature.
The measurements agree remarkably well with exact
computations based on Fredholm determinants, using
the connection between non-interacting 2D
and the Wishart-Laguerre ensemble of Random Ma-
rix Theory. We further characterized the crossover
in the number and spacing statistics from the low-
emperature distributions exhibiting Pauli repulsion
o the classical, Poissonian behavior with increasing
emperature. Our results constitute to our knowledge
he first experimental observation of a Fermi-sphere
oint process. Notably, our data agrees well with
RMT-based computations even in regimes of relatively
strong interactions. We believe that this unexpected
result may be explained by the similar resilience to in-
eractions of same-spin density correlation functions in
interacting Fermi gases discovered in a recent work [31].
Indeed, the same correlation functions appear in the
expansion of the characteristic function from which
he full counting statistics are derived. While this
result remains to be established analytically, our work
underscores the importance of counting statistics
observables and the tools of RMT for the study of
strongly correlated systems.

METHODS

Continuum Quantum Gas Microscopy. We probe
the system by freezing the motion of the atoms initially
evolving in continuous space, before imaging their posi-
tions. The pinning process consists in turning on a deep
optical lattice within ~ 10 ys, which traps each atom in
the nearest potential well [21, 22]. The ramp duration
is carefully chosen: it is slow enough to avoid projecting
atoms into high lattice bands, yet fast enough to
prevent significant motion before pinning is complete.

a

The pinning lattice is generated by the self-interference
of a red-detuned 1064nm laser, with three beams
crossing at 120° angles in the horizontal plane to form
a triangular lattice with a spacing ay, = 709nm [37].
The lattice wells have a measured trapping frequency of
~ 1MHz. Immediately after pinning, we apply Raman
sideband cooling [21]. This serves a dual purpose: it
cools the atoms close to the vibrational ground state of
their respective lattice wells and simultaneously induces
fluorescence. The spontaneously emitted photons are
collected by a high-resolution objective and imaged
onto a CCD camera. The resulting fluorescence images
are processed using a highly accurate neural network
algorithm to pinpoint the location of each atom [21].

Counting statistics measurement. We compute the
counting statistics from the positions of the detected
atoms in each image. A random point in space is
selected, around which disks of variable radius R are
drawn. Within each disk, we count the number of atoms
across all images. From this we obtain the particle
number counting statistics as function of kpR, where
kp is determined from the average density. Confidence
intervals are determined by repeating the measurement
across 100 randomly drawn disk center positions. We
restrict our analysis to a quasi-homogeneous region at
the cloud center of the cloud, where density variations
are limited to £5%.

NNS_ measurement. To compute the nearest
neighbor distance (NNS) distribution, we loop over
the atomic positions in the central region and store
distance that separates each considered atom from its
nearest neighbor. We repeat the measure for all the
images of a given preparation. From this we extract
an histogram that, after normalization, yields the NNS
probability distribution. Errorbars are obtained via
bootstrapping. The short distance data points obtained
via Eq. (18), uses a spline to the experimentally
measured go-functions shown in the Extended Data.
The final result is discretized for readability.

2D Model. The model consists of non-interacting
fermions in 2D with single particle Hamiltonian
Ho = p”/(2m) where p is the momentum. We consider
here the grand canonical ensemble at temperature T
and chemical potential j. One defines by convention
kp = V4an and Tp = 2nnh?/(mkg), where n is
the mean density (this corresponds to the standard
definition only at T = 0), These parameters are related
through e!/('e) — e!/t_ 1] and t = T/Tr.

Quasi-2D Model. The model consists of non-
interacting fermions in 3D strongly confined in the
transversal direction (z) by a harmonic potential, with
single particle Hamiltonian Hp = p?/(2m) + $mw?z?
One defines by convention kp = V4zn and Tp =
i?k2/(2mkg). Here n denotes the total 2D density (i.e.

the 3D density integrated over z), which is given by

In this model we will redefine r = kpR and t = T/Tp.

Counting formalism in 2D. We call Np the num-
ber of fermions inside a given disk of radius R = r/kp
One defines the probabilities Py(r) that there are N
fermions in the disk, i.e. that Vg = N, as well as the
generating function (GF), i.e. the full counting statistics

Since the positions of non-interacting fermions in the
grand canonical ensemble form a determinantal point
process, we obtain the following explicit expression for
the generating function

Gr(o) = Det(l— (1—e 7) rk) (11)

in terms of the 2D kernel K(x,x’) defined in the main
text and where IIp(x,y) denotes the projector on the
disk centered at the origin and of radius R. Using the
angular decomposition and extending the methods of
[20], to finite temperature the generating function can
be expressed as the product of Fredholm determinants
which appears in the right hand side of (3) in the main
text.

Counting formalism in quasi-2D. In the quasi-2D
model the total number of fermions in the cylinder of
radius R = r/kp is denoted Np, and the corresponding
probabilities that Np = N are denoted PLP (r, t), to
distinguish them from their 2D analog Py(r,t). The
random variable Ng can be written as the sum Vp =
Ye y>s0NRv of independent random variables Np, for
an effective 2D gas where ys has been shifted as pw >
fu —vhw,. Let us first introduce the hole probability
corresponding to the v-th z-level, which reads:

P¥ (r,t) = Po (sve =) (12)

taking into account the rescaled density p,n, with asso-
ciated Fermi momentum and temperature given respec-
tively by \/pykp and Trpy. Since the various z-levels are
independent, the hole probability for the whole cylinder
is simply the product P%?? (r,t) = [],s9 Px (r,t). A
similar formula holds for the quasi-2D generating func-
tion

So eX PHP (r,t) = T] | So eX Px (rt) (13)

N>0 v>0 \N>0

where Px(r,t) denotes the probability to find N
atoms in “the level v (similarly to the hole probability
in Eq.(12)). This expression allows to extract the
quasi-2D probabilities PEP rt t).

NNS formula in 2D. Let us introduce P(r), the
probability that, around a point of the point process
chosen at random, there are no other point within a
distance R = r/kp. The PDF of the nearest neighbor
spacing (NNS) defined in the text can be expressed as
p(s) = —7TLP3(r)|ps7 where kpr is the mean spac-
ing. The probability Ps(r) can be constructed from
a hole probability as follows. We denote Por, e) the
probability there are no fermions inside an annulus
€<p<-r/kp, where Po(r,0) = Po(r). Then one can
show [38] that

_ BR Te — Po(r,0
P(e) = i Ae

, (14)

where nme? for small € coincides with the probability
that there is a fermion in a disk of radius € around the
origin. Since for 2D non-interacting fermions P(r, ) is
given by the same Fredholm determinant formula as in
(11) setting s = +00, where now I]p is replaced by the
projector onto the annulus « < p < R=r/kp, taking
the limit € + 0 using standard identities for derivatives
of Fredholm determinants, we obtain the exact formula:

Po(r) = 4nP(r) [(1- P-KPy)-'P, KP, | (0,0) (15)

where the operator on the r.h.s. should be evaluated at
(p, p’) = (0,0), and

A small spacing approximate formula for the NNS
may be derived from two equivalent exact defini-
tions [36]:

Br) = -Po(r) (17)

= 5G (7) Polr), (18)

where ay (r)dr is the conditional probability of find-
ing an atom in the circular shell centered on one atom
of radius r and width dr. In the short-range regime
r <1, the probability of having more than one atom in
the circular shell is small, and we have G§?(r) Oo(7),
the usual two-point reduced density correlation func-
tion. Approximating further P5(r) ~ 1 for small r leads
to

B(r) = Sal) (19)

or equivalently Eq. (5) in the main text. This leads to
the expansion:
ee . Br

Pr) = & + 3a

+O(r’). (20)

At T = 0, the discrepancy between the exact result for
p(r) and the approximation is only O(r’).

NNS formula in quasi-2D. For the quasi-2D model
the formula (14) still applies for the corresponding prob-
ability P2’P(r), where now Po(r,¢) denotes the hole
probability associated to the cylindrical shell {e < p<
r, 2 €R}. Using, as above, that such a hole probability,
is a product over hole probabilities associated to each
level v one obtains in the limit « > 0

Numerical evaluations. The Fredholm determinants
(FD) in Eqs. (3) and (4) have been computed nu-
merically as functions of r,t, N, using Bornemann’s
method [39, 40] where the kernel is approximated by
a standard matrix with proper weights. The main idea
of the algorithm goes as follows: we truncate the infinite
product over @ in (3) at Cmax and, for @ € [0, £maxl, we
compute the FD Fy(@,7) on a truncated interval [0, Lo]
with r < L9. For this purpose, we pre-compute the
kernel matrices Ke of sizes M2, with matrix elements

where (x;,7;), i = 1,...,Ms are the nodes and the
weights of a Gaussian quadrature rule (GQR) for x €

uate numerically the integral over v in (2). In (22) the
(vi, i), for i = 1,...,M@), denote the nodes and the

weights of a GQR for v € (0, Li}.

From these matrices ke, we compute for fixed r and
0, the standard determinant of size Mp

Fu(8,r) = det (14+ (1—e)P,KE) . (23)

Here P, is the diagonal matrix with elements (P,-)i,; =
O(a,)O(r — 2;) with O(x) = 1 if x > 0 and O(x) = 0
otherwise. At the end we perform the product over ¢
and the numerical integration over @ using Gaussian
quadrature rule (GQR) for each N = 0,1,... to obtain
a numerical evaluation of Py (r) in (3)-(4). The numer-
ical evaluation of (15) proceeds similarly, performing a
matrix inversion involving the discrete kernel (22). Per-
forming a numerical derivative gives the NNS distribu-
tion plotted in Fig. 2b. The calculations for the quasi-
2D model use the p, as input (table I) are similar using
the formula (13), taking only into account the level with
non-negligible population.

In our simulations we have chosen the following pa-
rameters for which we obtain excellent convergence:
lmax = 10, My = 2500, L; = 1000, Mz = 1000, Lz = 20,
M3 = 2500. To obtain the data showed in the plots
we have discretized the variable r as r; = iAr, with
Ar = 0.05 and rmax = 8 and we have run the above
procedure on a separate core on the cluster for each r
independently.

FIG. $1. Additional hole probabilities and nearest neighbor spacing distributions for 2D Fermi gases. (a-b)
Experimental measurement of the hole probability Po (blue markers) as a function of kpR for samples at interaction strength
n = 2.1(2) (a) and 7 = 7.8(5) (b), respectively, with reduced temperatures T/Tp = 0.11(1) and T/T = 0.17(3), presented in
semi-logarithmic (main panels) and linear (insets) scales. Dashed (resp. solid) blue lines are theoretical predictions at zero
temperature (resp. experimentally measured temperatures). Additional curves show the high-temperature Poisson behavior
(dotted blue lines) and the zero temperature asymptotic behaviors in 1D (black dot-dashed lines). (c-d) Histograms (light-
blue), combined with data points (blue circles), of the nearest-neighbour spacing distributions p(s) for 7 = 2.1(2) (c) and
7 = 7.8(5) (d). The corresponding finite temperature predictions are shown with blue solid lines and histograms using similar
binning. We present the classical Poisson behavior (blue dotted curves) and the zero temperature prediction for 2D fermions
(blue dashed curve). The short range measurements extracted from the density-density correlation functions (Eq. (5)) is
shown as white circles. The dash-dotted lines are a cubic fit of the zero temperature prediction at short range.

temperature prediction for the ideal Fermi gas. The blue solid lines are two-parameter fits (see [31]), which we use as splines
to obtain the short-range behavior of the NNS distribution using Eq. (5) of the main text, with shaded areas indicating
uncertainty.
