Abstract

Capillary heterogeneity is increasingly recognized as a first-order control on gas plume migration
and trapping in aquifers and storage formations. We show that spatial variability in the water—
methane contact angle, set by mineralogy and salinity, reshapes capillary entry pressures and, in
turn, migration pathways. Using molecular dynamics simulation, we estimate contact angles on
quartz and kaolinite under fresh and saline conditions and embed these results in continuum-
scale multiphase flow simulations via a contact-angle-informed Leverett J-function, mapping
wettability directly onto the flow properties at continuum scale. Accounting for contact-angle
heterogeneity changes methane behavior: mobile and residually trapped methane in aquifers
decrease by up to 10%, while leakage to the atmosphere increases by as much as 20%. The
magnitude of this effect is scaled with the permeability contrast, leakage rate, salinity, and facies
proportions. By coupling molecular-scale wettability to continuum-scale flow and transport, the
cross-scale framework provides a more physically grounded basis for groundwater protection and

risk assessments, and yields more reliable emissions estimates. The approach can be generalized
to other subsurface gas transport problems including hydrogen and carbon dioxide storage as

well as to natural releases such as methane from permafrost thaw.

1 Introduction

Methane (CHa) leakage from subsurface sources into shallow aquifers and the atmosphere is a
significant environmental concern 1“. Fugitive CHa may originate from compromised wells,
natural faults, fractures, or surface activities, and is further complicated by naturally occurring
biogenic CHa >1. As a potent greenhouse gas, CHa poses risks to groundwater quality, climate,
and public safety, making it essential to predict its migration pathways 12-15. Recent work
highlights the strong influence of small-scale geologic features, with capillary heterogeneity
identified as a primary controlling factor for plume migration and trapping 1%17. Neglecting
capillary pressure variability biases predictions, often overstating atmospheric emissions and
understating aquifer retention 16. Building on this foundation, we investigate how mineral- and
salinity-dependent wettability, expressed as water—CH, contact angle heterogeneity, further

reshapes leakage pathways when integrated across molecular to aquifer scales.

Field studies and numerical models have demonstrated that small-scale structural features and
variations in capillary properties can redirect plume pathways, alter trapping efficiency, and
change leakage outcomes 1°18, Capillary heterogeneity has been recognized as a critical control
on gas migration 119-5, However, field studies have shown that neglecting this factor may
introduce systematic bias into gas plume migration predictions 19*1?>26, Beyond porosity- and
permeability-based scaling of capillary pressure, wettability represents an underexplored

dimension of heterogeneity with equally important consequences for plume behavior.

Conventional capillary pressure scaling in CHa leakage studies and in related problems (e.g., CO2
and H2 storage) typically relies on spatial variation in porosity and permeability while holding
interfacial properties fixed 1627-32, This approach overlooks the fact that wettability depends on
mineralogy and water chemistry (e.g., salinity), which changes local capillary entry pressures and,

in turn, migration pathways, but is rarely included in leakage modeling.

Direct measurements of contact angle (e.g., sessile/pendant drop) are valuable but face
well-known challenges such as surface contamination, unwanted roughness, and damage due to
smoothing during core preparation. As a result, the measured contact angle may not truly

represent the natural surface conditions. These challenges are particularly acute in

4
unconsolidated shallow aquifers 3734. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation provides a
complementary approach by resolving atomic-scale interactions at mineral—fluid—fluid interfaces.
Prior studies show good agreement between MD-computed and laboratory-measured contact
angles across a range of rock—fluid systems 35-9. In this way, MD simulation can supply facies-
specific wettability inputs that can be transferred to continuum-scale models through the Leverett
J-function, thereby making an explicit link between nanoscale surface physics and

continuum-scale multiphase flow.

Here, we explore the link between microscale wettability and macroscale leakage behavior by
integrating contact angles, computed from MD simulations as functions of mineral type and
salinity, into continuum-scale multiphase flow simulations of CH, leakage along a shallow aquifer
wellbore. This integration is achieved using a contact-angle-informed Leverett J-function, and
evaluate how explicitly representing heterogeneous wettability influences CH4 migration,
trapping, and leakage. We further identify the conditions under which this representation matters
most by varying salinity, permeability contrast, leakage rate, and facies proportions within

geologically plausible architectures.

2 Materials and methods

Integrating MD simulation-computed, mineral- and salinity-dependent contact angles with
continuum-scale multiphase flow simulations were performed in two stages. First, MD
simulations provided facies-specific contact angles under varying salinity conditions. Second, the
computed contact angles were incorporated into continuum-scale models to refine capillary
pressure scaling. The resulting simulations were used to quantify CH, leakage to the atmosphere
and to identify the conditions where quantifying contact angle variability is most critical for
accurate predictions. Computational costs for both MD simulations and continuum-scale

simulations are detailed in Supporting Information, Section $1.

All MD simulations were performed with the LAMMPS package *° with MPI parallelization and
GPU acceleration “6. Complete details of the force fields, equilibration protocols, and analysis

procedures along with comparison with prior lab results are provided in Supporting Information,
Section S2. Although shallow aquifers contain multiple mineral phases, previous studies indicated
that small-scale mineralogical heterogeneity exerts limited influence on solute transport, with
plume migration and spreading governed primarily by larger-scale hydrogeologic structure 24.
Based on the evidence, sediment variability was simplified into two principal mono-mineralic
facies: coarse grain (CG) and fine grain (FG) facies (i.e., bodies of sediment) *”. Quartz was selected

as the representative mineral for CG facies, while kaolinite-coated surfaces represented FG facies.

Quartz exists in various polymorphic forms, each characterized by a unique atomic arrangement,
depending on the pressure and temperature conditions of the porous medium +. Among these,
a-quartz with a (0001) surface is selected due to its stability under the target simulation
conditions ?. Since a-quartz crystallizes in a hexagonal structure, and the simulation box requires
a rectangular geometry, modifications to the crystal lattice are necessary. To achieve this, the a-
quartz unit cell 3 is duplicated along the x and y directions, then trimmed along specific
crystallographic planes to ensure two-dimensional periodicity and neutral charge of substrate. An
orthogonal unit cell is then constructed and replicated along the x, y, and z axes, maintaining
atomic stoichiometry and bond connectivity throughout the structure +. A Q2-cut is extracted
from the generated a-quartz surface and fully hydroxylated to represent realistic aqueous
conditions. For Q2, the silicon atom is bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms and two hydroxyl
(OH) groups. This is a less stable, highly reactive silanol group, found on the surface of silica, with
the structure (=Si-O-)2Si(OH)2. In contrast, kaolinite (AlzSiz0s(OH)a) is a non-swelling, 1:1 type
clay mineral composed of one tetrahedral silica (T) sheet and one octahedral alumina (O) sheet °.
Unlike smectites, kaolinite has negligible layer charge, and its interlayers are stabilized by
hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl groups on the alumina sheet and basal oxygen atoms on the
silica sheet, forming a rigid TO-TO stacking with minimal interlayer expansion. The kaolinite unit
cell is first extended in the x and y directions, then replicated three times along the z-axis to

generate the simulation domain.

Water—CH, contact angles on these minerals were estimated using established MD simulation
protocols that have been shown to reliably reproduce laboratory-scale measurements 324°, In
this study, a semi-cylindrical water droplet was placed on the mineral substrate in the presence
of CHa and equilibrated to steady geometry (Supporting Information, Figure $1). In the simulation

6
box, periodic boundary conditions are applied in the x- and y-directions to simulate an infinite
system, ensuring that when a particle exits one boundary, it seamlessly re-enters from the
opposite side. In contrast, nonperiodic boundary conditions are enforced in the z-direction,
where atoms may be reflected, absorbed, or constrained within the simulation box. To minimize
boundary effects, a reflective wall is placed at the top of the simulation box, and the box height
was selected to be sufficiently large to prevent any influence of the walls on the contact angle
measurements. The size of the simulation box is about 120 nm in z-direction, including the
substrate. The contact angle was measured at the three-phase boundary between the water

droplet, mineral surface, and CH phase to be used in continuum-scale simulations.

Continuum-scale simulations were conducted using the GEM module of Computer Modelling
Group (CMG, Version 2024.30). The range of the properties used in continuum-scale simulations
is based on prior field studies and numerical simulations in CHa leakage in unconfined shallow
aquifers 1”?3. The model domain was divided into three sections representing an unconfined
shallow aquifer with an overlying vadose zone and atmosphere (Supporting Information, Section
$3). Initial saturations were specified as 100% water in the aquifer, 40% water and 60% air in the
vadose zone, and 100% air in the atmosphere. The CH, leakage was introduced as a point source
in the aquifer to simulate upward and lateral migration. Air was modeled as a pseudo-pure
component, assumed insoluble under shallow subsurface conditions **. Fluid properties and
phase behavior were calibrated using CMG’s Winprop module (Supporting Information, Section
$3.1). Section-specific relative permeability and capillary pressure functions were assigned to

represent multiphase flow behavior and potential leakage to the atmosphere.

Capillary-pressure scaling for each grid block incorporated wettability variability via a contact-

angle-informed (CA) Leverett J-function *9:

), accounts for scaling of pore-size correlation length. In the no-contact-angle

(NCA) scenario, wettability is assumed constant, so the first term equals unity and the scaling
reduces to the conventional porosity-permeability formulation used in most gas transport

studies.

Each simulation began with a 30-day pre-leakage phase, during which injection and production
wells at model boundaries operated at about 0.6 m?/day to establish steady-state groundwater
flow. The CHa leakage was then introduced at a constant rate of 0.14 rm?/day for 60 days, and

simulations were extended up to 100 days to ensure stabilization of leakage pathways.

The spatial distribution of CG and FG facies within both the aquifer and vadose zone was modeled
using a transition-probability-based approach implemented in T-PROGS °° (see Supporting
Information, Section $3.2). This method generated 25 stochastic realizations of the facies
architecture, each representing a distinct spatial configuration of CG and FG facies while
maintaining identical volumetric proportions. The realizations differ in the geometry, spatial
arrangement, and connectivity of the facies, thereby capturing geological uncertainty and

allowing assessment of stochastic variability in model outcomes.

To represent different hydrogeochemical conditions, both MD and continuum-scale simulations
were conducted for zero-salinity (O ppm NaCl) and saline (12,000 ppm NaCl) groundwaters. The
freshwater case represents inland aquifers recharged primarily by precipitation, while the saline
case represents coastal aquifers, evaporative basins, or regions influenced by agricultural

recharge °1-*4.

For the base scenario, the permeability of CG facies, CH4 leakage rate, and volumetric proportion

of CG facies were set to 5,000 mD, 0.14 m7/day, and 40%, respectively. From this baseline,
additional scenarios were developed by systematically varying key parameters: (i) increasing CG
permeability from 5,000 to 20,000 mD while raising the log-scale variance from 0.3 to 1.0; (ii)
increasing CH4 leakage rate and total leakage volume by a factor of 2.5; (iii) increasing salinity
from 0 to 12,000 ppm to assess the influence of groundwater chemistry; and (iv) increasing the
volumetric proportion of CG facies from 40% to 60% to examine the effects of sedimentary
variability and connectivity. The upper limit of 60% CG facies was selected because, in two-
dimensional systems, the connectivity threshold occurs near 50%. The resulting CHa distributions
across mobile, trapped, and dissolved phases were then compared between contact-angle
included (CA) and NCA scenarios to evaluate the influence of contact angle on leakage

predictions.

3 Results and discussion

3.1 Contact angle estimation

Estimated contact angles from MD simulations are presented in Figure 1. To confirm that
simulation time was sufficient, the normalized vertical position of the water droplet center of
mass was tracked for each mineral at two salinity levels (0 and 12,000 ppm NaCl). As shown in
Supporting Information, Figure S2, all cases reached a plateau, indicating that equilibrium was
achieved (6-10 and 2 ns for quartz and kaolinite, respectively). The MD-computed contact angles
fall within the range of previously reported laboratory measurements for quartz (Supporting
Information, Figure $3), supporting the reliability of the approach. Variability among
experimental values likely reflects differences in sample preparation, surface conditions,
measurement techniques, and operator handling. The consistency between our MD results and
this experimental range further supports the validity of the modeling approach; however, the
uncertainty observed in laboratory measurements should also be acknowledged and

incorporated into the analysis.

Quartz is consistently more water-wet than kaolinite. Increasing salinity reduces water-wetness
on both minerals, raising contact angle (8) by about 14° on quartz (from about 20° to about 34°)

and by about 3° on kaolinite (from about 63° to about 66°). The stronger salinity response on
quartz is physically reasonable ** © as dissolved salts screen electrostatic charges at the mineral-
water interface, weakening water’s adhesion to the surface and enhancing gas wettability. The
uncertainty in contact angle was estimated for both minerals under zero salinity and saline
conditions using 10 frames from the final 1 ns of the MD simulations. For quartz, the standard
deviation of the contact angle is approximately 1.7° in zero salinity groundwater and 2.6° in saline

water, whereas for kaolinite, it is about 3.7° and 4.0°, respectively.

3.2 Continuum scale simulations

After completing all simulations, we first examined how the averaged CH, (%) distribution
converged as the number of realizations increased. This convergence analysis, conducted for the
base scenario after 190 days of simulation, considered variations across different reservoir
sections and fluid phases. The objective was to verify the statistical stability and
representativeness of the simulation results, ensuring that the observed CHa migration and
trapping behaviors were not influenced by random variability in mineral distributions (Supporting
Information, Section $4.1). Once convergence was confirmed, plume propagation was compared
between CA and NCA scenarios. As can be seen in Supporting Information, Section $4.2, including

contact angle variability in scaling the capillary pressure curve (NCA) reshapes the distribution of

10
capillary entry pressure in the reservoir by smoothing out sharp contrasts between high- and low-
pressure regions, creating a new heterogeneity pattern. This redistribution reduces the lateral
spread of the leaked CH4 plume compared to conventional scaling (CA). Once leakage ceases, CHa
movement is largely upward or becomes trapped, as capillary forces shaped by the
heterogeneous entry pressures, together with gravitational forces from the density contrast
between CHa and groundwater, dominate over viscous forces that would otherwise drive
horizontal migration. Animations of CHa plume migration through the aquifer and vadose zone
for a representative scenario were provided in Multimedia attachments. Results show that
incorporating contact angle variability generates additional flow pathways that reduce the sharp
plume fronts typically observed when only conventional capillary heterogeneity is considered. CA
also leads to higher leakage to the atmosphere compared to NCA. Moreover, the animations
illustrate how the mobile CHa phase in the aquifer gradually breaks into disconnected clusters
once injection stops, indicating the loss of hydraulic connectivity. These isolated gas clusters
become increasingly immobilized over time due to capillary trapping, which prevents further

upward migration and contributes to the long-term stabilization of CHa in the subsurface.

As demonstrated, contact angles computed from MD simulations inherently contain some degree
of uncertainty. Comparison with experimental measurements indicates that the MD-derived
contact angles fall within the range of laboratory results; however, certain unaccounted factors
may still influence wettability behavior. To account for these potential effects, a sensitivity analysis
was conducted by varying the contact angle of each facies by +10°. To capture the range of
possible outcomes, continuum-scale simulations were conducted for two extreme scenarios
representing maximum and minimum contrasts in facies-specific contact angles. These scenarios
were used to assess the influence of contact angle uncertainty on CHa leakage predictions.

Further details are provided in Supporting Information, Section $4.3.

Figure 2 illustrates the uncertainty of temporal evolution of CHa partitioning across the aquifer,
vadose zone, and atmosphere for 25 stochastic realizations, comparing the NCA and CA cases.
These variations in facies configuration led to differences in plume migration and trapping
behavior, which are reflected in the variability shown in the figure. Within the aquifer and vadose
zone, CHa was categorized into mobile, snap-off trapped, and dissolved phases. As CHa quantities

11
in the vadose zone and their associated variability were relatively small, only the total value is
reported here (see Supporting Information, Section $4.4 for details on trapped CH, in the vadose
zone). In the atmosphere, only total CHa is presented, as CH, exists solely in the gaseous form in
this region. In the figure, each row corresponds to a specific sensitivity scenario on base scenario
such as increased permeability, elevated salinity, higher CH4 leakage or increased volume
proportion of CG facies, while each column shows the temporal distribution of CHa across the
different sections or phases. The resulting CHa percentages represent the fraction of CHa moles
in each phase or section relative to the total leaked CHa in each simulation. Variability was
quantified as the standard deviation from the mean across the 25 realizations, reflecting the
influence of geological heterogeneity on plume propagation and phase partitioning. In the plots,
solid lines indicate mean values, shaded regions denote one standard deviation above and below
the mean, and gray shaded areas highlight regions of overlap between the CA and NCA cases,

illustrating where their results converge.

Within the aquifer, mobile CH4 concentration increases during the leakage phase, then declines
after leakage stops as CH4 becomes trapped, is dissolved, or migrates upward. Among the phases,
dissolved CH, shows the least variability (about 10%). Incorporating contact angle heterogeneity
reduces aquifer CHa by up to 10% in both mobile and trapped phases, while atmospheric leakage
increases by as much as 20%. In contrast, the vadose zone exhibits only a minor increase in CHa,

with negligible differences between CA and NCA averages.

At higher leakage rates, differences between CA and NCA scenarios diminish, and variability
across realizations decreases. The reduction arises because viscous-dominated flow suppresses
capillary effects, leading to enhanced CHq migration into the atmosphere regardless of wettability

assumptions.

Figure 2. Variability of leaked CH4 across 25 stochastic realizations of mineral heterogeneity.
Simulations were performed in the aquifer, vadose zone, and atmosphere over 190 days,
comparing cases with and without contact angle incorporation. Scenarios include: (a) Base
scenario, (b) Permeability increase (4xBase), (c) Leakage rate increase (2.5xBase), (d) Aquifer
salinity increase (changed from 0 to ~12,000 ppm), and (e) Volume proportion increase (coarse-
grain (CG) volume proportion changed from 40% to 60%). In the aquifer, results are shown for
mobile CH, gas, snap-off trapped CHa, and dissolved CHa; in the vadose zone and atmosphere,
only total CHa gas is shown. Abbreviations: CA = contact angle included in capillary pressure
scaling; NCA = no contact angle included.

13
While Figure 2 illustrates variability using standard deviations symmetrically around the mean,
the approach may obscure the full range of outcomes across realizations. To more explicitly
capture the spread in CH, distribution, we evaluated the results after 190 days using box plots
(Figure 3), which provide a clearer representation of variability among scenarios in each section.
Each box represents the interquartile range (25th—75th percentile), with the central line
indicating the median. Whiskers show the spread of non-outlier data, and individual markers
denote outliers. This statistical representation highlights both the central tendency and the

variability across scenarios with and without contact angle (CA versus NCA) effects.

Comparison of interquartile ranges between the CA and NCA cases indicates that incorporating
contact angle enhances the variability associated with mineral heterogeneity, thereby increasing
the influence of stochastic realizations. Among all scenarios, the largest variability in mobile CH4
is observed under permeability increase, where the interquartile range is widest and the median
difference between CA and NCA reaches nearly 10%. In contrast, scenarios involving increased
leakage rate or volume proportion exhibit the smallest differences, both in variability and median

values.

For snap-off trapped CHa, the interquartile range generally increases when contact angle is
included, except in the permeability increase case. Median values exhibit the largest CA-NCA
difference (about 20%) in the base case and in the salinity increase scenario, although the
absolute values differ. This suggests that aquifer salinity, which can vary with environmental
conditions, influences CH,4 partitioning across phases. Notably, despite the variations, the
difference between CA and NCA remains consistent in the trapped phase, indicating that contact
angle effects must be incorporated for accurately quantifying CHa trapping. Dissolved CHa follows

a trend similar to trapped CHa.

In the vadose zone, CA scenarios consistently yield slightly higher mobile CHa fractions compared
to NCA, with median differences below 3%. The exception is the leakage rate increase scenario,
where both median and variability are nearly identical. CHa percentages in this section range
between 9-12% for CA, reflecting the absence of capillary trapping due to loose sediments and

the transitional role of the vadose zone between aquifer and atmosphere.

14
Atmospheric leakage is the most critical factor for environmental impact. As expected, scenarios
with increased leakage rate and volume result in the greatest CH, release to the atmosphere, with
median values of approximately 75% for CA and 70% for NCA. These findings highlight the
importance of incorporating contact angle variability into modeling efforts, as it alters CHa
partitioning among phases and directly affects the magnitude of emissions reaching the

atmosphere.

4 Implications and future research

Our results extend prior field-calibrated evidence that capillary heterogeneity exerts a significant
effect on CHa plume geometry and fate in shallow aquifers. Whereas simplifying or ignoring
capillary heterogeneity leads to overestimated atmospheric CH4 and underestimated mobile CHa
in the aquifer +5. We demonstrate that heterogeneous wettability, expressed through spatially
variable water—CH, contact angles as a function of mineralogy and salinity, adds an independent
and quantifiable effect by directly modifying local capillary entry pressures even when
permeability and porosity are fixed. Incorporating contact-angle variability (CA) changes
partitioning: aquifer mobile and snap-off trapped CH, decrease by up to 10%, while atmospheric
leakage increase by up to 20%. The CA—-NCA difference decreases at high leakage rates, consistent

with a transition toward viscous-dominated flow.

Our findings have important practical implications for leakage risk assessment. Conventional
models that assume constant wettability (NCA) underestimate atmospheric leakage in settings
where mineralogy and groundwater salinity covary, such as quartz-rich coastal or evaporite
aquifers +. This bias arises because salinity increases the contact angle on quartz much more than
on kaolinite, lowering capillary entry pressures in quartz-dominated saline systems and
promoting earlier gas breakthrough and higher leakage flux. Conversely, decreasing groundwater
salinity can reduce the contact angle and raise capillary entry pressures, thus, enhancing gas
trapping and limiting leakage. To quantify these dynamics, a contact-angle-informed Leverett J-
function, Equation (1), should replace conventional scaling that accounts only for porosity and
permeability, particularly in mixed-facies aquifers with sharp mineralogical contrasts or evolving
salinity. This approach complements the findings of Ershadnia et al. (2021) 16, which highlighted
the dominant role of meter-scale facies architecture in controlling plume migration. They
demonstrated that heterogeneous wettability acts at the same scales and must therefore be
jointly characterized, mapped, and modeled to improve predictions of subsurface gas transport

and leakage risk.

17
Recent advances in micro-CT imaging have enabled direct extraction of contact-angle fields from
pore-scale images, demonstrating that wettability is inherently spatially heterogeneous. rather
than taking on a single uniform value °°. Building on this evidence, a practical approach for
applying CT results at the field scale is to use CT data as a facies-level calibrator. In this workflow,
a limited number of representative core plugs from each facies can be imaged, and their contact-
angle distributions computed. The resulting statistics can then be mapped as a facies-conditioned
contact-angle field throughout the reservoir model. Our contact-angle—informed J-function is
designed to incorporate such fields directly, enabling propagation of pore-scale heterogeneity
into continuum-scale flow simulations. Where CT data are unavailable, MD simulation-computed
contact-angles serve as physically grounded alternative that can later be refined as even limited
CT measurements become available. This hybrid strategy circumvents the challenges of direct CT-
to-field upscaling, ties wettability estimates to measured rock textures, and naturally facilitates
uncertainty quantification through ensemble sampling alongside variations in permeability

contrast, leakage rates, and salinity.

In this study, we focused on clean quartz and kaolinite surfaces and assumed static contact angles;
however, natural sediments often exhibit additional complexities such as surface roughness
(asperities), organic coatings, iron oxide precipitates, and contact angle hysteresis (advancing vs.
receding angles), all of which can significantly influence wettability and plume migration. Future
experimental and modeling efforts should address the effect of these factors to better represent
realistic leakage in unconfined shallow aquifers. Moreover, salinity was held constant in our
simulations, whereas in nature, groundwater chemistry evolves over time due to changing
boundary conditions, which in turn can alter contact angle and capillary behavior. Continuum-
scale measurements of contact angle variability and leaked CH4 plume propagation across space
and time are therefore crucial to validate and refine predictive models and to capture the
dynamics of CH4 leakage. Such data, combined with improved models, will enhance the accuracy

of risk assessments for groundwater quality and fugitive CH4 emissions.

The implications of our findings extend beyond shallow aquifers. Heterogeneous wettability
remains a critical unknown in deep geologic systems, including CO2 and H2 storage or toxic
chemicals such as NAPL, where high mobility ratios make capillary heterogeneity, a key factor

18
controlling plume propagation and contributing to short-term trapping 19273272854, Addressing
such knowledge gaps by integrating laboratory, field, with multiscale modeling studies will
improve predictive capabilities for both shallow and deep subsurface fluid migration and support

the development of safer and more effective energy and climate mitigation technologies.
