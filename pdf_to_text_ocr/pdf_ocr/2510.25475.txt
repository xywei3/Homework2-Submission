Owing to remote and in-situ observations of Jovian auroral
decametric emission (DAM; see{Marques et al.[2017| and refer-
ences therein), the basic properties of electron cyclotron maser
(ECM) radio emission stemming from a magnetopshere are well
understood: ECM emission occurs at the local cyclotron fre-
quency and is beamed along the surface of a cone. The opening
angle of the cone is wide and its axis parallel to the magnetic
field line. Therefore, the aggregate radio emission from different
magnetospheric regions typically appears as a broadband signal
that is modulated by the rotation rate of the magnetosphere (akin
to a lighthouse; [Callingham et al.[2024). In the case of Jupiter,
its ECM emission is modulated at around 10 hours, which is the
rotation period of the Jovian magnetosphere. This measurement

ABSTRACT

Brown dwarfs display Jupiter-like auroral phenomena, such as rotationally modulated electron cyclotron maser radio emission. Radio
observations of cyclotron maser emission can be used to measure their magnetic field strength, topology, and to deduce the presence
of magnetically interacting exoplanets. Observations of the coldest brown dwarfs (spectral types T and Y) are especially intriguing,
as their magnetospheric phenomena could closely resemble those of gas-giant exoplanets. Here we report observations made over
ten epochs, amounting to 44 hours, of WISEP J101905.63+652954.2 (J1019+65 hereinafter) using the LOFAR telescope between
120 and 168 MHz. J1019+65 is a methane dwarf binary (T5.5 + T7) whose radio emission was originally detected in a single-epoch
LOFAR observation to be highly circular polarised and rotationally modulated at ~ 3h. Unexpectedly, our long-term monitoring
reveals an additional periodic signature at ~ 0.787h. We consider several explanations for the second period and suggest that it
could be the rotationally modulated emission of the second brown dwarf in the binary, although follow-up infrared observations are
necessary to confirm this hypothesis. In addition, the data also allow us to statistically estimate the duty cycle and observed radio-loud
fraction of the 120-168 MHz cyclotron emission from methane dwarfs to be (D) = 0.030% and F”

= 0.088018 respectively.

technique has provided the most accurate measurement of the
rotation period of gas giants in the Solar System (e.g. [Higgins]

et al.J1997} Carbary & Mitchel. It has also been success-
ful in determining the rotation period of brown dwarfs down to
spectral class T (i.e. methane dwarfs) (Callingham et al.2024).
Jovian ECM emission is also modulated in a second period
corresponding to the orbital period of Io (Marques et al-]2017).
This component of the emission is induced by the interaction
between the conductive ionosphere of Io and the Jovian mag-
netic field (Zarka]1998). Because the electrons involved in this
component only exist along the flux tube connecting Jupiter and
lo, beaming ensures that the emission reaches the observer only
when Io is at certain longitudes in its orbit. Identifying a second
periodicity in brown dwarfs could analogously lead to the iden-
tification of exoplanets. Exoplanets around cold methane dwarfs

likely exist but have eluded discovery so far
ping et al.[2012).

The rotation periods of radio-loud brown dwarfs are usu-
ally in the range of a few to several hours measured via their
radio light curves (Kao et al.|[2016]
. The rotational periodic
modulation can therefore be detected with a modest amount of
telescope exposure. However, the orbital periods of putative ex-
oplanets around brown dwarfs could be in the range of days.
Detecting the second periodicity therefore requires significant
telescope time.

loud brown dwarf system. Located at 23.3 + 1.0pce (

inafter J1019+65) consists of two brown dwarfs in a binary
with spectral types T5S.5 + 0.5 and T7.0 + 0.5

. The two brown dwarfs have a projected separation of
423.0 + 1.6mas which corresponds to 9.9 + 0.4 AU
tham et al.//2023). J1019+65 showed circularly polarised radio
pulsations at 144 MHz using data from the LOFAR Two-metre
Sky Survey (LoTSS;|Shimwell et al.]2017). This marks the first
methane dwarf binary to be detected in the radio wavelength.

Using the Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram (Lomb|1976

of ~ 3hours from the LOFAR-band light curve of J1019+65.
interpreted this radio-derived three-hour
period as the rotation period of the radio emitter in J1019+65.
However, since LoTSS has an absolute astrometric precision
of 0.5’ (defined by the Gaussian-equivalent standard deviation;
Shimwell et al.2022), it is not possible to discern which of the
two brown dwarfs in J1019+65 is the radio emitter (or perhaps
both are) with the LoTSS data alone due to insufficient angular
resolution.

Despite the complication of identifying the radio-loud com-
ponent in J1019+65, it is a well-suited system for monitoring
for the following reasons: Since LoTSS is an untargeted all-sky
survey, the radio detection of J1019+65 does not suffer from se-
lection bias which is inherent to targeted observations. Thus,
by studying J1019+65 further, we can learn more about the
population of radio-loud brown dwarfs using J1019+65 as an
archetype. Furthermore, unlike isolated brown dwarfs, the bi-
nary nature of J1019+65 will allow for an independent mass

constraint using future infrared observations
(2023).

In this work, we present our observational campaign of
J1019+65 with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR). The cam-
paign comprises 44 hours of new radio observations plus the
original 8-hour LoTSS data, spanning 6 years (2017-2023),
making it one of the most intensive long-term monitoring of a
brown dwarf system in radio wavelength to date. The paper is
structured as follows. In Sect.|2] we present the details regarding
the follow-up observations of J1019+65 carried out by LOFAR,
which also include the description of the data reduction proce-
dure. We discuss our results in Sect.B]and conclude in Sect. [4]

2. Observations and data reduction

Since the discovery of J1019+65’s radio emission in the LOFAR
Two Metre Sky Survey data release 2 (LoTSS DR2) exposure,
we have acquired 10 new follow-up observations with LOFAR
as part of projects LC15_019 & LT16_013 (details in Table in
Table[Ip. Except for the first epoch (2021) of our follow-up ob-
servation (project code: LC15_019) which has the same expo-
sure time (8 hours) as the LoTSS discovery field, all other LO-
FAR observations (project code: LT16_013) lasted 4 hours each
to ensure that we covered the full three-hour rotation (with a 20
uncertainty range of 2.6 — 3.8 hours;|Vedantham et al./2023) of
J1019+65 in each observation.

We processed the LOFAR dataset for each epoch using
the standard LOFAR Initial Calibration (LINC) pipelind?| to
flag interference and correct for direction-independent errors.
See [de Gasperin et al.] (2019) for more details of these effects
and the calibration strategy used in the LINC pipeline. After-
wards, we processed each dataset using the direction-dependent
self-calibration and imaging pipeline (DDF-pipeling’). The

Notes. oy4min represents the local root-mean-square (RMS) noise
around J1019+65 averaged across all Stokes V 4min-cadence images
(each synthesised over the full bandwidth). The date and time formats
follow ISO 8601. The exposure time includes overheads.

DDF-pipeline is described by|Shimwell et al.|(2022) and{Tasse|
fet al.| (2021). The procedure also involved extraction and self-
calibration to remove other sources in the field before self-
calibrating on the target field, as described by[van Weeren et al_|
(2021). Finally, we synthesised the full-exposure Stokes I and
V images of J1019+65 for each LOFAR epoch using wsclean
with Briggs weighting (Briggs|[1995). We used robustness pa-
rameters of —0.5 and 0.0 for Stokes I and Stokes V images, re-
spectively.

The post-processing analysis for all datasets follows the pro-
cedure described by (2020} [2023). For each
calibrated dataset, we first used wsclean (Offringa et al.)2014)
to create Stokes V dirty snapshot images synthesised over the
full bandwidth (120 — 168 MHz) at a cadence of 4 minutes af-
ter phase-shifting the visibilities to the proper-motion-corrected
sky location of J1019+65. We used the ephemeris of|Kirkpatrick|

(2019) to account for proper motion. Furthermore, we split
the data into three spectral bins (120-136 MHz, 136-152 MHz,

and 152 — 168 MHz) to check for any spectral evolution in the
light curves. We then produced light curves for each epoch
and spectral bin by extracting the value of the flux density at
J1019+65 from the 4min images. For each light curve, we com-
puted the Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram using the astropy
implementation (Astropy Collaboration et al.)201 3] 20TS 2022)
to determine if there were any strong peaks in the LS power spec-
trum of J1019+65. To quantify the significance of a periodogram
peak, we computed its false-alarm probability (FAP) using the
approach gg SEAT (2008) that was included in the astropy
implementation. The FAP represents the probability that a light
curve with no periodic component would lead to a peak of a
similar height as the one detected (VanderPlas[2018). Figure[A-3]
in the Appendix shows the post-processed light curve and peri-
odogram from the original LoTSS 2017 epoch and serves as a
reference for our follow-up radio observations.

dwarf emitters remains largely unconstrained, it is entirely pos-
sible that J1019+65 was simply not producing sufficiently bright
and singular ECM burst for detection during most of our obser-
vations.

In terms of periodicity, only the 8-hour follow-up observa-
tion (2021-02-23) shows a significant detection (FAP « 0.05).
The rest are only 4 hours long and thus cannot reliably measure
the 3-hour rotation period of J1019+65 in a single exposure. Fig-
ure [I] shows the radio light curve of the 2021-02-23 epoch and
the corresponding LS periodogram. Although we did not detect
a single radio pulsation that is as strong as the original pulse
from LoTSS DR2, the periodogram clearly detects the original
period of ~ 3h. We shall hereafter refer to this frequency as f; as
represented in Fig.[]] However, in contrast to the original 2017-
03-08 epoch, the f; peak is not significant for the full-bandwidth
light curve (blue); the f; peak is much more significant (FAP
< 0.003) at 120-136 MHz (orange), while the other two spec-
tral bins (136-152 MHz and 152-168 MHz; green and purple)
did not contribute to this peak. This suggests that there is some
spectral shape evolution with time in the rotationally modulated
emission.

The other 9 LOFAR single-epoch light curves and their cor-
responding LS periodograms can be found in Figs. [A-T]and[A.2|
in the Appendix.

2.2. LOFAR cross-epoch analysis

We also concatenated all 10 LOFAR follow-up light curves plus
the original LoTSS DR2 light curve of J1019+65 to create a
cross-epoch light curve that spans over 6 years (from 2017-03-
08 to 2023-03-20), and computed its LS periodogram, as shown
in Fig. |2} Note that one can see the peculiar fine-scale struc-
ture around the spectral peaks in the zoomed-in inset figure. The
structure stems from the observational pattern (i.e. the window
function) because the observed spectrum is a convolution of the
true spectrum and the window spectrum (grey), which has a com-
plex structure due to a combination of long temporal baseline
(> 2 year) of our data and the 4min “sampling” interval of the
light curve. See[VanderPlas}(2078) for more details regarding the
various effects of the window function on the observed power
spectrum in the LS periodogram.

2.2.1. New periodic signature

Fig. [2] shows that the original periodogram peak originally dis-
covered by{Vedantham et al.|(2023) is present at f; ~ 0.325 h"!
as expected. In addition, we discovered a new periodicity in
our cross-epoch light curve that was not seen by {Vedantham|
fe at :

fet al] (2023): There exists a statistically significant
1.271 hour | which corresponds to a period P) ~ 0.787h. The

FAP of this peak is less than 0.3 %.

Note that we do not report the formal uncertainty of the mea-
sured frequency in this periodogram analysis due to the reasons
discussed by [VanderPlas] (2018). Briefly, the frequency uncer-
tainty is defined by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of
the periodogram peak which is equal to the inverse of the tem-
poral baseline. However, such an assignment of uncertainty is
fraught for sparse sampling over a large temporal baseline — 6
years long in our case. This is because the presence of numer-
ous adjacent peaks in the window function makes it impossible
to identify the true peak. Therefore, a more pragmatic choice for
the uncertainties of f; and fp in this cross-epoch analysis would
be the FWHM of the envelope of the first peak of the window

function, which is approximately 0.2 h~! shown in Fig.|2| Using
this definition of FWHM and Eq. 52 by {VanderPlas| (2018), the
uncertainties in f; and 5 were computed: f; = 0.325 + 0.006 h™!
and fp = 1.271 + 0.006h"!.

2.2.2. Fidelity of f; and fy

Despite a sufficiently small value of FAP for the significant
frequencies, a periodic signature in an LS periodogram could
still be spurious if they are caused by e.g. image artefacts such
as sidelobes from nearby bright sources. To test the fidelity of
the two detected periodic signatures of the radio light curve of
J1019+65 at P; ~ 3.077 + 0.057h and Pz ~ 0.787 + 0.006h,
we used the following method: We first pick a randonf{] sky lo-
cation in the field of J1019+65 and sample the corresponding
pixel in the LOFAR Stokes V image, which involves comput-
ing the cross-epoch light curve and the LS periodogram of this
random pixel. The LS power (i.e. height) of the most significant
(i.e. highest) peak in this periodogram is then recorded, before
we repeat this trial many more times in order to get an ensem-
ble of the maximum peak height of each random-pixel power
spectrum. The idea behind this test is that if the periodicities de-
tected in J1019+65’s light curve are, in fact, caused by sidelobes
of nearby bright sources, other sky locations in the field should
also show spurious periodic signatures of similar significance in
their periodograms. Therefore, we performed 2396 trials (each
on a different pixel) and determined that < 0.3 % of all random-
pixel power spectra has a peak that exceeds the height of the
Sr peak, and « 0.3% of the f, peak, shown in Fig. B] We can
thus empirically eliminate the possibility that the f; and f: peaks
were caused by image artefacts.

Another test of the fidelity of f; and f, is to randomly shuffle
the data points of the original light curve and compute the LS pe-
riodogram of the shuffled light curve. The maximum peak height
of the power spectrum was then recorded each time we shuffled
the data points. We performed 1000 trials and determined that
< 0.3% of all flux-density-shuffled power spectra has a peak
that exceeds the height of the fp peak, and « 0.3% of the fi;
peak, shown in Fig. [4]

As shown in Fig.|A.4] we can see that unlike the f, signa-
ture which is only present in the 120-136 MHz, the fp signature
shows up still at higher frequencies of 136-168 MHz. This im-
plies a difference between the spectral shape of the radio emis-
sion that is responsible for the f, and f> signatures.

2.2.3. Phase-folded light curve & stacked image

Figures [5] and [6] show the cross-epoch light curve when phase-
folded with each of two significant periods — P; = 3.07h and
Pz = 0.79h respectively — derived from the f; and f; peaks
discussed in Sect. From the figures, we can see that both
phase-folded light curves are mostly below the zero line, imply-
ing that J1019+65 was producing a significant amount of phase-
averaged (negative) Stokes V flux density in sub-mJy scales.
Since a single normal LOFAR observation can only reach a lo
sensitivity of ~ 0.2 mJy in an 8-hour exposure

, a single epoch of observation would not be able to re-
veal the periodic emission. However, the intrinsic variability of

+ Due to the effect of point spread function, we avoid sampling pixels
too close (< 6”) to the sky location of J1019+65 and of random pixels
already sampled. However, we also exclusively sample pixels in a 5’
radius region centred at J1019+65 to ensure that the local RMS noise
around the sampled pixels is similar to that around J1019+65.

More importantly, it appears that this emission was detected
mainly within a certain phase ¢ range. For example, as shown in
Fig.} J1019+65 has significantly more negative Stokes V emis-
sion, both on average (with a weighted mean Sy = —0.136 +
0.029 mJy) and when ¢, takes a value between 0.3 and 0.8 ap-
proximately, reaching its peak at ¢; ~ 0.55. We see the same
phenomena in Fig. [6] However, note that the quasi-sinusoidal
profile of the data in Figs. [5] and [6] should be interpreted with
caution, as the LS algorithm specifically finds periods that yield
a sinusoidal phase-folded light curve. In other words, it may be

standard deviation (0 ~ 0.5”) in the absolute radio astrometry
of LOFAR (Shimwell et al.J2022). As such, we are confident of
the association between J1019+65 and the radio source in the
stacked image.

Comparing the stacked image in Stokes V (Fig. 7) with that
in Stokes I (Fig. B we can see that the source is 100% circu-
larly polarised, which is consistent with ECM emission.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Handedness and emission geometry

As seen in Figures[5]and [6] the emission of J1019+65 occurs in
specific phases and has a preferred Stokes V handedness. Note
that we define the sign of circularly polarised emission as left-
hand circularly polarised emission minus right-hand circularly
polarised emission (Callingham et al.|/2023). The bright burst
arrives at a phase corresponding to the peak in the rotationally
modulated emission. A preference in both the emission polarisa-
tion and the rotational phase of the radio source is also observed
in Jupiter (Marques et al-/2017). In Jupiter, right-hand circular
polarised emission (stemming from the northern hemisphere) is
more frequent than its left-hand southern counterpart due to the
stronger magnetic field amplitude in the northern hemisphere
(Zarka et al. 1996} Bonfond et al. 2013). The preferential de-
tection of Jovian radio emission at certain rotational phase is
due to ECM beaming, as discussed in Sect. Therefore, the
phenomenology of rotational modulated emission in J1019+65
shares several similarities with the Jovian case, suggesting a
Jupiter-like radio engine operating in J1019+65.

The origin of the persistent emission of J1019+65 can there-
fore be interpreted as follows: The magnetic field lines of
J1019+65 host ECM emission in a large region covering all az-
imuthal sectors. As the magnetosphere of J1019+65 rotates, the
ECM emission beams from different azimuthal sectors come into
and out of our line of sight. The rotationally modulated emis-
sion of J1019+65 detected within a particular phase is simply
the collective ECM emission from all the visible beams during
said time frame, and its maximum magnitude occurs when the
maximum range of sectors is visible to the observer. Typically,
magnetic obliquity restricts the visible period to a small fraction
of the rotation period and could make the emission from both
magnetic poles visible at some fraction of the rotation period
(Williams et al.[2017). In contrast, J1019+65 shows a persistent
emission of the same handedness. This could indicate that the
magnetic obliquity is smaller than the angular thickness of the
emission cone, thereby keeping the source from a single mag-
netic pole in view for most of its rotation.

The detected radio burst of J1019+65 occurred near the peak
of the phase-folded light curves as seen in Figs. and {6} The lo-
cation of the burst is also consistent with a Jupiter-like engine be-
cause we have the highest chance of seeing anomalously bright
ECM-induced radio bursts when the persistent emission is de-
tected at the highest significance, which should correspond to the
rotational phase at which the maximum amount of ECM conical
beams are towards our line of sight. We also note that the flux
density of the burst of J1019+65 is around several mJy, which
is ~ 1 order of magnitude brighter than its persistent emission.
This is consistent with what was seen in Jupiter as well

007).

3.2. The true nature of f2

Finding two distinct frequencies in the periodogram is unusual
and requires an explanation. There are four possibilities for the
secondary peak at f): (i) a spurious frequency caused by aliasing,
(ii) some harmonic of f\, (iii) a true frequency corresponding to
the rotation period of the other brown dwarf, or (iv) a true fre-
quency due to satellite interaction. Let us tackle each possibility
individually in this order.

Aliasing: Like any other method based on Fourier transform,
the LS periodograms can have aliased power. In general, for an
observation whose window function has a strong power at of,
one can expect an observed peak fpeax to be an alias if there exist
peaks at | fpeak + df, where n € N* is small (n ~ 1). With that
in mind, we inspected the window function for our cross-epoch
analysis (plotted in[A5) and identified the different prominent
peaks. For example, our “sampling” rate of 4 minutes corre-
sponds to 6f = 15hour', so clearly this cannot be responsible
for creating aliases of f| at f2. We were unable to identify a peak
that could explain the value of f; and f, based on aliasing.

Harmonic: If the signal is periodic but not sinusoidal, its power
in the periodogram will be present at the fundamental frequency
f also at higher harmonics nf, where n € {2,3,4,...}. This is
especially relevant for Jupiter-like radio-loud objects such as
J1019+65, since (i) we anticipate a light curve that resembles
an on-off function, and (ii) there exist certain magnetic configu-
rations that allow a brown dwarf to pulsate more than once per
rotation; Jupiter typically emits 2 pulses for every rotation. As
fo/ fi = 3.91, the closest harmonic number is n = 4. This results
in a residual of 4f, — fo = 0.029 + 0.025 hour™!. In comparison,
the frequency uncertainty of f| in the original LoTSS DR2 data
shown in Fig. [A-3]has a value > 3 times smaller than this resid-
ual. Moreover, there are no signs of a significant harmonic peak
at 2f; or 3f; in the LS periodogram (recall Fig.|2), which is con-
trary to what was expected if f; is indeed the fourth harmonic.
Furthermore, the LS power at f) can exceed that at f; in some
spectral bands as seen in Fig. If f2 were to be a harmonic
of fi, f2 should not have any LS power in the 136-168 MHz
band, and yet it does. For the above reasons, f> is unlikely to be
a higher harmonic of f.

Rotation of the second brown dwarf: Since J1019+65 is a
brown dwarf binary, f: may correspond to the rotation rate of the
“second” brown dwarf, given that f; corresponds to the “first”
brown dwarf. In this scenario, both brown dwarfs in J1019+65
emit persistent ECM emissions in the LOFAR band; since LO-
FAR does not have sufficient angular resolution, the emissions of
both brown dwarfs were superposed, thus creating a light curve
with two periodic signatures P; = 3.07h and P2 = 0.79h. Us-
ing the estimation of J1019+65’s physical parameters by
tham et al.}2023), we calculated the rotation break-up period to
be 0.45 h for the more massive T5.5 brown dwarf and 0.51 h for
the lighter T7.0 brown dwarf in J1019+65, so a 0.79h period
is physically possible. If true, the second brown dwarf would
be the fastest rotating brown dwarf ever detected (cf. [Tannock]

2021). However, interpreting P2 as the rotation period can

be fraught (see for e.g. {Williams et al.]2017) without indepen-
dent confirmation from infrared photometry. For instance, it is

also plausible that the radio period is a harmonic of the true
rotation period. Regardless, for this scenario to work, both ra-

dio emitting objects must have comparable radio luminosities,
which is somewhat contrived. Follow-up infrared observations
on J1019+65 may be the key to determining the nature of fh; a
detection of these (P; and P2) periodicities in the infrared light
curve of J1019+65 due to the anticipated rotational modulation
would definitively confirm the authenticity of f. Moreover, us-
ing adaptive optics, the two components of J1019+65 were eas-
ily resolved (Vedantham et al.[2023). Therefore, further infrared
observations could also help determine which brown dwarf has
the longer or shorter period.

Satellite interaction: Based on the Jovian analogy, an intrigu-
ing possibility is that the two periodicities come from two emis-
sion components: one modulated by the rotation of the emitter
(0.79 h) and another modulated by the orbital period of a com-
panion satellite (3.07h). Are such short rotation periods even
feasible? To answer this, we first checked the Roche limit by
computing the net force on a test particle at the surface of the
satellite. To avoid disintegration, the centrifugal force plus the
gravitational force due to the satellite’s mass must exceed the
gravitational force of the brown dwarf at the surface of the satel-
lite. The calculations show that if the brown dwarf mass is 30 My,
then disintegration of the satellite can only be prevented if the
mean density of the satellite exceeds » 4gcm™>. Such a high
density is unlikely for a rocky planet, but possible for a mas-
sive gas-giant planet or another brown dwarf. Next, we con-
sidered the tidal evolution of the orbit. The putative satellite is
beyond the co-rotation radius, which means its orbital distance
will increase due to tidal forces. Equations for the approximate

timescale for such an evolution have been derived by [Bolmont]

(2011). We used their Eq. 2 with an eccentricity of 0, pri-
and

mary secondary masses of 30 My and 5 My; respectively, pri-
mary and secondary radii equal to the Jovian radius and an or-
bital period of 3h as characteristic values. We find that the or-
bital evolution timescale is under 10° yr even if we assume that
the putative planet is perfectly tidally locked to the brown dwarf.
Because we have no indication of J1019+65 being a very young
system, the short tidal evolution timescale is a serious problem
for the existence of a planet in such a short orbit.

3.3. Radio-loud fraction and duty ratio of brown dwarfs

J1019+65 was the only brown dwarf system within 25 pe de-
tected in LoTSS DR2 among hundreds of catalogued brown
dwarfs and within the survey footprint. Therefore, prior to our
follow-up radio observations, it was reasonable to assume that
J1019+65 has some atypical property (e.g. binarity, spectral
type, and rotation rate) that led to a detectable level of radio
emission. Our follow-up exposures combined with the 8h-long
LoTSS exposure amount to 52 hours over two years, in which
we only detected one radio burst lasting for several minutes. Be-
cause J1019+65 was identified due to its bright 4-minute burst,
we are led to an interesting question: Was J1019+65 discovered
because it is atypical, or is J1019+65 typical and it happened to
be in a high-flux-density state during the LoTSS DR2 observa-
tions? In other words, are radio-emitting brown dwarfs rare or is
radio emission common among brown dwarfs, but a flux-limited
surveys only picks out the small numbers of brown dwarfs that
happen to be in a high-activity state?

3.3.1. Rarity vs Activity

We shall first explain the “rarity” and “activity” of J1019+65
within a mathematical context: Let Fyagio = Neadio/Mtotat and
(D)pgp be the fraction of brown dwarfs that are “radio-loud”
and the expected (average) duty ratio of a “radio-loud” brown
dwarf respectively. In this context, we define a “radio-loud”
brown dwarf as one that is capable of emitting ECM emission
detectable in a typical 8h LoTSS DR2 exposure, which has a
median continuum noise of 95 wy in the 120 — 168 MHz band.
For our 4h observations, this corresponds to a median contin-
uum noise of around 134 yJy. indicate at what phase relative to
the phase folded light curves it corresponds to Therefore, the ra-
dio detectability of a brown dwarf mainly hinges on whether said
brown dwarf can generate such ECM emissions in the first place,
and if so, how often we expect the brown dwarf to generate them.
Fyadio encapsulates the former, while (D)gp the latter.

Intuitively, one can see that the two quantities of Fyadio and
(D)pp correspond to the “rarity” and “activity” of a radio-loud
brown dwarf respectively: a small value of Fragio implies that
radio-loud brown dwarfs are rare, while a small value of (D)gp
implies that radio-loud brown dwarfs are mostly inactive, thus
leading to a small number of detections in a survey.

Mathematically, the duty ratio of a radio-loud brown dwarf
is defined as D = Pon/Pgp, where Pon is the length of time for
which the brown dwarf’s radio signal is “on” in a single rota-
tion period Pgp = Pon + Po of said brown dwarf. In the context
of this analysis, the radio signal of J1019+65 at time ¢ can be
considered “on” when its ECM emission exceeds a certain de-
tection threshold during said time f. This definition is equivalent
to the following statement: Dy1o19 represents the probability of
detecting significant (i.e. above detection threshold) radio emis-
sion from J1019+65 at any given time (ignoring beaming for
now). We shall revisit this statement in later analysis.

3.3.2. Constraints on (D)gp and Fradio

With the concept of “rarity” and “activity” mathematically de-
fined, we now proceed to explain how constraining the duty ra-
tio of J1019+65 can ultimately lead to constraints on Fradio and
(D)pp. Recall from Sect.|1|that by the virtue of an untargeted ra-
dio sky survey, the radio detection of J1019+65 in LoTSS does
not suffer from selection bias that is inherent to targeted ob-
servations (where most other radio-loud methane dwarfs were
found). Moreover, as highlighted in Sect. the radio emis-
sion from J1019+65 matches the characteristics of the canoni-
cal Jovian periodic pulsed emission profile previously seen from
brown dwarfs and ultracool dwarfs (e.g. [Hallinan et al.|[2007|
{2008} 2015), meaning J1019+65 should be a typical radio-loud
brown dwarf in this regard. Both reasons are crucial if one were
to justify any estimation of Fyagj. and (D)gp using the statis-
tics of J1019+65. Therefore, we assume that the magnetic field
strength of J1019+65 is not atypical for the underlying brown
dwarf population.

Now, because J1019+65 is at d = 23.3 pc, we take all known
brown dwarfs within 25 pc as our parent sample. This gives us
a total of 106 brown dwarfs (spectral types LO-Y2) within the
LoTSS DR2 footprint based on the volume-complete sample by
[Best et al.](2024). Therefore, this naturally leads to the follow-
ing question: Given that the total number of brown dwarfs in
LoTSS DR2 is Nporss = 106, what is the probability of de-
tecting only | radio-loud brown dwarf (i.e. J1019+65)? Even if
all brown dwarfs were to be radio-loud, only a fraction would
be visible from the Earth due to beaming. And since we can-

data. The 2D distribution have contours indicating the regions contain-
ing 68 % and 95 %.

not differentiate between a brown dwarf that is not radio-loud
and a radio-loud brown dwarf that is not beaming towards us,
the observed fraction of radio-loud brown dwarfs is therefore
a dio = FtadioX Fheam, Where Feam is the fraction of (radio-loud)
brown dwarfs that beam towards us (and thus visible to us).

Finally, under these assumptions, we can proceed with de-
termining the probability of detecting only k = 1 brown dwarf
in LoTSS DR2, which should follow a Poisson process with the
rate parameter 2:

P(A,k = 1) = Ae, A= Mots X (D) pp X Fracio: (1)

Already, computing P(A) gives us the joint probability distri-
bution function (PDF) of (D)gp and F ig* The singular LoTSS
DR2 detection can only constrain the product of (D)gp and
F aio? meaning J1019+65 could have been the singular radio-
loud object, or it could be just a typical brown dwarf that hap-
pened to be in a bright state during the LoTSS DR2 exposure.
This is clearly illustrated in red in Fig. [9] where we computed
the covariance of the posterior distribution of (D)gp and F tio
based on Eq. [I]

To break this degeneracy between (D)gp and F iagign WE NOW
consider the non-detections of radio pulsation in our follow-up
observational campaign of J1019+65. As explained in Sect.
we observed J1019+65 with LOFAR for a total of 52 hours,
which corresponds to n ~ 17 rotations of the radio emitter in
J1019+65 based on the radio-derived period P; = 3.0742 hour.

We ignore P» in this analysis} Recall that the phenomenon of
radio pulsations is the consequence of rotational modulation due
to beaming; intuitively, we expect to detect 1 pulse per rotatior{|
for a brown dwarf with D = 1. Therefore, the probability of de-
tecting only x = 1 bursts given that the LOFAR observations
covered n rotations of J1019+65 is given by:

P(p,n=17,x= 1) = ( p'(i-p)"* = 17p-p)'®,  p = Dios.
(2)

where (@) = aT is the binomial coefficient. As explained ear-
lier in this section, we can interpret J1019+65 as an accurate
representation of a radio-loud brown dwarf in this sample owing
to the virtue of untargeted survey. This is a powerful statement

> Even if P2 really is the period of the radio emitter rather than P,, it
would have provided a tighter constraint anyway since we would have
covered more than 68 rotations of the radio emitter.

© For certain magnetic configurations, it is possible to have more than
1 pulse per rotation. For example, Jupiter typically produces 2 pulses
per rotation at about 40° and 190° longitude.

as it implies Dy\o19 = (D)gp, hence we can constrain (D)gp sim-
ply by estimating the duty ratio of J1019+65. As we can see in
Eq.[2] the binomial distribution depends solely on the duty ratio,
unlike Eq. [I]

The likelihood of our LoTSS DR2 and follow-up observa-
tions is thus given by the product of Eq. [I]and Eq. [2] The re-
sult is shown in blue in Fig. |9} compared to the data in red
that only contains the LoTSS data, the extra restriction pro-

vided by Eq. [2] greatly improve the constraints on (D)gp and
consequently Fyaio- one a detailed version of the

marginal PDFs presented in Fig. [)] Both curves in Fig. [TO] are
unimodal. Therefore, using the method of maximum likelihood

estimation (MLE), we obtained (D)gp = 0.030*°.%4 and F’

0.030 radio ~
0.088*0-568. Moreover, we can reject any value of (D)gp > 0.177

and F tio > 0.959 with > 95% confidence. The rejection of
a large (D)pp implies that in order to capture the moment of a
radio burst from a brown dwarf, one must either (i) observe a
radio-loud brown dwarf for many rotations, or (ii) observe many
brown dwarfs at the same time (e.g. a sky survey). Therefore, if
LoTSS were to be repeated, we would expect to find new radio-
loud brown dwarfs with detected burst. Furthermore, we can es-
timate Fream = Q/4a ~ 12.7 % based on the instantaneous solid
angle of the measured Jovian emission beam Q = 1.6 sr
et al.[2004). Note that this value serves as a lower limit of Fyeam;
for brown dwarfs with magnetic obliquity, their beaming pattern
would thus sweep across the sky, as the magnetic pole wobbles
around when observing over a whole rotation period. This esti-
mate gives uS Fradio = F tio/ F beam < 0.691, meaning that brown
dwarfs such as J1019+65 cannot be too rare. In comparison, our
estimation of Fyadio is consistent with the work by[Kao & Pineda]
(2024), which showed that the fraction of ultracool dwarf binary
systems that emit persistent radio emission is 0.56*?-{. Note that
the focus of their work is on the incoherent (gyro)synchrotron
emission stemming from radiation belts of brown dwarfs rather
than coherent ECM emission.

4. Conclusions and outlook

Our follow-up observational campaign of J1019+65 with LO-
FAR led to 52 hours of observations that span around six years.
We only detected a periodic signal at 120-136 MHz in one out
of ten individual LOFAR epochs using LS periodogram, while
the rest of the epochs were all non-detection. Moreover, we did
not detect any radio burst from J1019+65 similar to the original
pulse by [Vedantham et al-| (2023) in any of our follow-up obser-
vations.

Despite the lack of radio bursts, we found that J1019+65
shows persistent circularly polarised emission that is periodi-
cally modulated. We find two distinct periodicities: a new pe-
riodic signature of Py = 0.79h and the 3h period initially iden-
tified by |Vedantham et al] We find that the periodogram
peak corresponding to the new period in the LS periodogram
is not a spurious signal due to aliasing, harmonic structure, or
the window function. If fy is indeed the rotation rate of the sec-
ond brown dwarf in J1019+65, it would have the shortest rota-
tion period of any brown dwarf to date, although an association
of the two peaks to the two objects of the binary must await
independent conformation, possibly from IR band photometry.
Moreover, the ratio between the two inferred periods is about
4; we don’t have systematic samples of T dwarf binary periods
for comparison but in low-mass stellar binaries, the two compo-

nents tend to have similar rotation periods (see e.g.|Harding et al.

Article number, page 10 of 16

[2013} [Stauffer et al-[2016). If the same trend continues for cold

brown dwarfs, then this period ratio would be unusual.

Based on the non-detection of bursts in most of our LO-
FAR observations, we computed the posterior distribution for
the fraction of radio-loud brown dwarfs and the radio duty cy-
cle of a typical brown dwarf, allowing us to constrain the rarity
of a radio-loud brown dwarf and the average activity of a radio-
loud brown dwarf. As such, we were able to statistically deter-
mine that radio-loud brown dwarfs in the LOFAR band should
not be too rare (Fradio S 0.691); we just need to stare at brown

dwarfs for long enough due to their low duty ratio on _aver-
age ((D) = 0.030*0-0%4). In comparison Kao & Pineda (2024)
showed that the fraction of ultracool dwarf binary systems that
emit persistent radio emission is 0.56*®!!, which is consistent

—O.11?
with our estimation, although it should be noted that the persis-

Fig. A.3. LOFAR observation of J1019+65 carried out on 2017-03-08 (i.e. LoTSS DR2 epoch). Top panel: Stokes V light curves with a cadence of
4 minutes at different frequencies. The shaded region represents +1o uncertainty. The negative ~ 10mJy burst at 120-136 MHz (enclosed in red)
has a signal-to-noise ratio of > 7. The light curve at 152-168 MHz is omitted for the sake of clarity. The top axis represents the time of observation
in Modified Julian Dates (MJD). The black dashed line at 0 mJy is drawn for clarity. Bottom panel: Lomb-Scargle periodogram of the radio light
curves. The three red dashed lines represent the necessary LS power (i.e. peak height) to achieve a false-alarm probability (FAP) of 5 %, 1%, and
0.3 %. The grey curve represents the (negative) LS periodogram of the window function, which is a light curve with the same timestamps as the

original curve, but the flux density of each data point is replaced with unity (i.e. a flat light curve).
