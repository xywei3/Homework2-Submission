QUANTUM DYNAMICAL BOUNDS FOR QUASI-PERIODIC
OPERATORS WITH LIOUVILLE FREQUENCIES

ABSTRACT. We establish quantum dynamical upper bounds for quasi-periodic
Schrédinger operators with Liouville frequencies. Our approach combines
semi-algebraic discrepancy estimates for the Kronecker sequence {na} with
quantitative Green’s function estimates adapted to the Liouville setting.

1. INTRODUCTION

In this paper, we study the quantum dynamics of one-dimensional discrete
Schrodinger operators H. It is well-known that the solution of the time-
dependent Schrédinger equation 10,7) = Hw is given by v(t) = e~*#u(0).
For simplicity, we assume that the initial condition ~(0) = ¢ has compact
support. The position operator X is defined as

(XW)n = Un.
To describe the evolution of ¢(t), we focus on the time-averaged p'" moment
of the position operator defined via
2 f? _.
(Xulg)CE) = ze [COL XPOOae (1)
Thus the growth of T ++ (|Xxy|§)(T) reflects the speed of which the particles
spread out.

In particular, we consider the quasi-periodic Schrodinger operators H = Hy
on (?(Z),

(Hov)n = Uns + Un-1 + V(O+ na) bn, (2)
where V € C%(T,R) is the potential, 9 € T is the phase, and a € R\ Q
is the frequency. The quantum dynamical behavior of Hg depends heavily
on the arithmetic property of the frequency a [Las96, GSB99, JZ22, LP22].
We say a is Diophantine if |/nal|¢ > n\n|~7 for some 7 > 0,y > 1 where
|| - || := dist(-,Z). We say a is Liouville if it is not Diophantine.
It has been shown that in the regime of large potential V and Diophantine
frequency a, the quantity (|Xu,|%)(T) remains finite for almost every @ €

T, and we achieve the so-called dynamical localization, see [Bou05, GYZ23,
BJ00, JKL20]. However, dynamical localization fails to hold for generic 6 € T
[JS94, JL24, JLM24].

For Diophantine frequency a, the growth behavior of (|X1,|5)(T) has been
investigated through various methods. In [Liu23], Liu established quantum
dynamical upper bounds for long-range operators on Z4(d > 1) based on the
sublinear bounds for the semi-algebraic discrepancy:

#{ |n| << N:0+namodZeEO}< NI, (3)

where 9 is a semi-algebraic set with suitable complexity. In [LPT*25, LPW24],
the authors further developed this approach by applying tools from analytic
number theory to analyze the discrepancy of semi-algebraic sets in the setting
of quasi-periodic operators with multi-frequency shift and skew-shift poten-
tials. More recently, Shamis-Sodin [SS23] developed a method applicable to
operators on Z7, using quantitative Green’s function estimates from [Liu22].
The arguments in [Liu23, $S23] both require that the bad boxes are sufficiently
rare so that they cannot fill any line of a large scale box (i.e., a sublinear bound

All known results establishing power-logarithmic upper bounds of the form
(log T)© crucially rely on the Diophantine condition for a. This naturally leads
to the question: What is the growth behavior of (|Xy,|)(T) when a is Liou-
ville? For Liouville frequencies, sublinear discrepancy bounds fail, rendering
the methods of [Liu23, LPT*25, LPW24] inapplicable.

Our proof is inspired by Jitomirskaya—Liu [JL21], which established a T*
bound under the existence of a single suitably chosen box of the Green’s func-
tion. A key observation in the present work is that a similar one-box assump-
tion already suffices to obtain a power—logarithmic bound of the form (log T)°.
The argument in [JL21] relied on the monotonicity of the transport exponent
with respect to p, which, however, led to the loss of a sharper estimate for
(|Xi|G)(7). In our approach, we decompose the estimate of (|X|) (7) across
different scales, which allows us to achieve an improved bound.

In this paper, we first prove a general criterion (Theorem 3.1) for deriving
quantum dynamical upper bounds. Notably, this criterion applies even to
long-range operators without underlying dynamical systems. The criterion is
based solely on the existence of a single suitably chosen box of the Green’s
function.

We then turn to discrepancy estimates for shift dynamics {na} on semi-
algebraic sets in the case of Liouville frequencies. As a consequence, we verify
the existence of a box of the desired Green’s function, extending the sublinear
bounds known in the Diophantine case to a weaker, yet still effective, setting.

Denote by L(F) the Lyapunov exponent, see Section 2 for the definition.
As applications to quasi-periodic operators, we obtain the following results:

Theorem 1.1. Let V € C*(T,R) be non-constant and assume L(E) > A >0
forall EER. Letn>0,y7 > 1. Suppose that a € R satisfies

||Ina||r = n|n|~7 for alln € Z\ {0}.
Then there exists Cy > 0 such that for any p > 0,¢ > 0 and 6 € C(Z)
compactly supported, there exists Ti(a,V,A,¢,p,€) > 0 such that for T >T,,

sup(|Xnlg)(7) < (log Tee,

Theorem 1.2. Let V € C¥(T,R) be non-constant and assume L(E) > A >0
forall EER. Letn>0,K >0,y7 > 1. Suppose that a € R satisfies

|nalla > nee)” for all n € Z\ {0}.

Then there exists Cy) > 0 such that for any p > 0,¢ > 0 and 6 € F(Z)
compactly supported, there exists To(a,V,A,¢,p,€) > 0 such that for T > To,

sup\IXin[2)(T) < exp (pa(Co +e)"(oglogT)),
6eT

Theorem 1.3. Let V € C¥(T,R) be non-constant and assume L(E) > A >0
foralE ER. Letn>0,K>0,0<7< ae Suppose that a € R satisfies

Inala > ne" for alln € Z\ {0}.

Then for any p > 0,¢ > 0 and d € @(Z) compactly supported, there exists
T3(a,V,A,¢,p,€) > 0 such that for T > T3,

sup(|Ximl2)(T) < exp (nto now),
6ET

Remark 1.4. In Theorem 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3, the constant Co = 5C’, where
C > 1 is the constant C(d) from Lemma 2.2 when d = 1.

Theorem 1.1 is not new; it was previously established in [JL21, Liu23, JP22,
LPT*25]. In fact, those works provide stronger versions with explicit esti-
mates on the constants, which our approach does not yield. However, we
include the result here to demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our
method. Theorems 1.2 and 1.3 are new. In the same setting, we note that
Damanik—Tcheremchantsev [DT07, DT08] proved an upper bound T*. Theo-
rems 1.2 and 1.3 thus provide quantitative estimates for this T* in the case of
Liouville frequencies.

The existence of a good box is ensured by the discrepancy estimates for
semi-algebraic sets in Section 4. To derive the Green’s function estimates
on the good box, we apply the large deviation theorem for transfer matrices
established in [HZ22], which remains valid in the Liouville setting.

2. PRELIMINARIES

2.1. Transfer matrix and Lyapunov exponent. Denote by Ci(T,R) the
space of real-valued bounded analytic functions on the strip {@ : |S0| < h}.
For any V € C#(T,R), define

[Vln = sup |V(8)].

|S0|<h

Let C*(T,R) := Uns C#(T, R).
Let EF € R. Denote

For any finite interval A = [21, v2] C Z with x, < £2, define the transfer matrix
from x; to v2 as

- TI SV (0+ ka).

k=a2-1

For Hp» defined in (2), we let Ha(@) := Ha(V,0) := RaHpRa, where Ry is
the projection onto A. In particular, for A = [0,N — 1], denote Hy(@) :=
It is straightforward to verify that

Mee ,x2] (0) = Myy—«,41(0 F 21Q).

For N > 1, it is well-known (see [Bou05]) that

det Ay(@ -—£# — det Ayn_\(@+a -£L
My(9) = (ar ake - 5 - ee + ’ - a ’

with the convention det(Ho(@) — £) := 1 and det(H_,(@) — E) :=—1.
Define the Lyapunov exponent as

L(E) = gin. [108 MoO) a
By the unique ergodicity, one has

L(£) = lim sup

Jog || Ma(0 MI. (5)
[Alco ger |Al

According to the Thouless formula, the positivity of L(£) for all E € R yields
that L(z) > 0 for all z € C.

2.2. Green’s Function. Denote by o(H) the spectrum of H. For z ¢ o(H),
the Green’s function of H at z is defined by
G(z):= (H-zI)",
and for a finite interval A, define
Ga(z) = (RyHRy — 2D)".
In particular, for Hg defined in (2) with A = [a1, x9] with a, < x2 and 2, <
m <n <x, by Cramer’s rule we have
det (Him—x,(@ + a1) — z) - det(Hy,~-n(@ + (n+ 1)a) — 2)
det(H,(@) — z) ,

Ga(z,9)(m,n) =

Using (4), it follows that

|| Mei m—1] 9)|| . | Min+1,c2](9)]| (6)

2.3. Semi-algebraic sets.

Definition 2.1 ([Bou05]). We say S C R?@ is a semi-algebraic set if it is
a finite union of sets defined by a finite number of polynomial inequalities.
More precisely, let {P;, P2,--- ,P;} be a family of real polynomials to the
variables « = (21, %2,+++ , Ua) with deg(P;) < q for i = 1,2,--- ,s. A (closed)
semi-algebraic set S is given by the expression

S=U fire": Pla) sie 0}, (7)

j tel;

where £; € {1,2,--- ,s} and je € {>, <,=}. Then we say that the degree of
S, denoted by deg(S), is at most sq. In fact, deg(S) means the smallest sq
overall representation as in (7).

Lemma 2.2 ([Bou05, Gro87, Yom87, BN19]). Let S C [0,1]? be a semi-
algebraic set of degree B. Let € > 0 be a small number and Leb(S) < «4. Then
S can be covered by a family of €-balls with total number less than BCe-4,

2.4. Discrepancy.

Definition 2.3 ([DT97]). Let {x,}*_, be a sequence in T“. The discrepancy
of x, is defined as

l<n<N:a,€l
Dy(tt,) = sup |#ULS™ SN it €
TER N

where R denotes the family of all axis-aligned rectangles in T?.

Leb(J)|,

In particular, for 7, = 6+na mod Z4, we denote by Dy (a) the discrepancy
for short (which is independent of 6 by Definition 2.3).
The Erdés—-Turén—Koksma inequality provides an upper bound for Dy (an).
6 QUANTUM DYNAMICS WITH LIOUVILLE DISCREPANCIES

3. CRITERION FOR QUANTUM DYNAMICS

In this section, we establish a criterion for quantum dynamical upper bounds
based on Green’s function estimates on suitable scales. The following criterion
works for bounded self-adjoint long-range operators on (?(Z).

Theorem 3.1. Let {V,,} € €°(Z) be a real sequence, and consider the long-
range operator

(AW)n = > Am¥n—m Tr VaUns
where Am = Am and |Am| < Cye~%!'| for allm € Z. Assume that o(H) C
[-K +1, -1] for some K > 3.

Let ¢ € €(Z) be compactly supported. Suppose that for every |N| > No,
there exists an interval I C RL — Wh NZorlC pM, I) NZ satisfying the
following conditions:

(1) There exists a monotone increasing function U : Rt — R* such that
|Z| > W(IN|) > (log |N|), (8)
for some constant Cy > 1.
(2) There exists 0 < co < c, such that for any z = E + ie with |E| < K
and0 <€<&,
I
IGr(z)(m,n)| < e@!|_— for all lm —n| > vr (9)

Then for any p > 0, there exists Ty = To(¢, K, C1, C2, C1, 2, €0,p) such that

for all T > To,

(Xul)(T) < Ir (= ws)

where [ : Rt + Rt is the inverse function of WV.

Proof. Let z= E+ 4 where |E| < K and T > x Recall the following lemma

This finishes the proof.

In particular, we are interested in the following V(-).
Corollary 3.3. Under the assumptions of Theorem 3.1, if V(-) takes the form
U(N) = N°

that for all T > T3,

We first prove a few fundamental results regarding discrepancy estimates
for the Kronecker sequence {na} on Té.

Define A = ®(2"). We need the following result:

Lemma 4.2. For alll < | AJ, there are at most 24+ points m in T,. satisfying
the inequality
IA < ||(m,a)|lv < (1+ I)A™.

Proof. Otherwise if there exist (241 + 1) points, then by the pigeonhole prin-
ciple, either there will be (24 +1) points satisfying

[owen = hema
or there will be (24 +1) points satisfying
I|(m, o) |x = 1 — {(m, a).

In either case, there exists a hyperoctant of Z? such that at least two points
m,m! among (24 + 1) points are located in this hyperoctant, which means

mym >0 forall j =1,--- ,d.
It would follow that

and

5. LARGE DEVIATION THEOREM FOR LIOUVILLE FREQUENCIES

Since we are interested in quantum dynamics with Liouville frequencies, we
will need the following large deviation theorem for transfer matrices, which
holds in the Liouville setting.

Theorem 5.1 ({HZ22]). Let a € R\ Q and V € C(T,R). There exist
constants &(V, h),2(V,h) € (0,1) such that, if!

0< Bla) <A inf L(E),

then there exists Ny = Ni (a, infgejay) L(E),V,h) > 0 such that for any N >
N,, the following large deviation estimates hold uniformly in E € [a,b]:
(1) If0 < L(E) <1, then

N 100
(2) If L(E) > 1, then

Leb {0 | Flow iMy(O)l ~ Ex(E)] > pgblE)} < eam

1 P 2
2 | _ a —@2,L(E)°N
Leb {0 : | olla( Lx(B) > mo) <e .
Remark 5.2. In fact, ww in Theorem 5.1 can be replaced by any 0 < k < 1.
See Remark 1.2 in [HZ22].

The conclusion of Theorem 5.1 remains valid for complex energies EF + ie,
where E € [a, 6] and |e] < eo for some sufficiently small ¢9 > 0 because the proof
of Theorem 5.1 only involves the subharmonicity of the Lyapunov exponent.
More precisely, we have the following:

Corollary 5.3. Under the same assumptions as in Theorem 5.1, there exist
N, = Ni(a,V,a,b) > 0 and €9 = e9(a, V,a,b) > 0 such that for any N > Ny,
the following holds uniformly for z = E + ie where E € [a,b] and |e| < €:

Leb {0 |= togliav(ll — Lye)

Ss 700 co} <e

With Theorem 5.1 and Corollary 5.3 in hand, we deduce the following large
deviation theorem for Green’s function in the Liouville setting.

Theorem 5.4. Let a € R\ Q and V € C¥(T,R). There exist constants

there exist No = No(a,V,a,b) > 0 and 69 = e(a,V,a,b) > 0 such that for
any N > No, and z= E+ ie with E € [a,b] and |e| < e, the following holds.
There exists a subset On C T (depending on z) with

Leb(Oy) < e~22OON+)  deg(On) Sp L(z)2N®,
such that for any 0 ¢ On, one of the intervals
A= [-N,N);[-N,N — 1];[-N+1,N];[-N+1,N -]]

will satisfy

IGa(z)(m,n)| < en 2tOm—"| for any |m—n| > 7

Proof. By Corollary 5.3, for any N > Ni(a, V,a, 6), there exists a subset Oy C
T with Leb(Qy) < e~2@4@@N+Y such that for any 6 ¢ Oy,

Then it follows from (4) that for one of the intervals

we have for any 0 ¢ On,

It follows from (6),(19) and (20) that for any 0 ¢ Ow, we have

In particular, for any 6 ¢ Oy and m,n € A with |m — n| > |A|/20,
IG4(6)(m,n)| < ew 22Ohr,
In the following, we estimate the complexity. Consider the property

Since V € CP(T,R), we write V(@) = Ypez V.e2"*8, Consider its Fourier

which implies for any 0 ¢ Oy,

Thus we may substitute V by V; in (21), that is,

eh)" det (Hy(Vi, 0) — E)mnl < Sone ela det(H,(Vi, 9) — z)|, (22)

where M,,, denotes the (m,n)-minor of matrix M. Using the Hilbert-Schmidt

Clearly, (23) is of the form
P,(cos 270, sin 270) > 0, (24)
where P, is a polynomial with degree at most C”N*. One further truncates
“cos” and “sin” by a Taylor polynomial of degree at most N, and get a tighter
inequality of the form
P,(8) 2 0, (25)
where the degree of P» is at most C’N®. It is obvious that (25) implies (24),
which further implies (21).
Denote 04, = {8 € [0,1] : P2(@) < O}. By the definition of the degree of
semi-algebraic sets (see Definition 2.1), we have deg(O4,) < C?.N°.
For any 0 ¢ Ow, it is easy to check that P,(0) > 0 (with ¢ replaced as 2c).
Thus 04, C Oy and

Finally one may replace Oy by On. This finishes the proof.

6. PROOF OF MAIN RESULTS

We are now ready to prove our main results by combining the tools developed
in Sections 3, 4 and 5.

6.1. Proof of Theorem 1.1.

Proof. Fix a small ¢ > 0 and take N sufficiently large. Let C > 1 be the

constant C'(d) from Lemma 2.2 when d = 1. Define an interval J C Z centered

at 0 and of length |J| = N° with 6 = Be —e. Set J; =I +) for |j| < N.
Recall that for any 6 € T, one has H;,(@) = H;(@+ ja). Then for any

z= E+, with sufficiently large T,

G1,(z,9) = Gy(z,8 + ja). (26)

By Theorem 5.4, there exists a subset @; C T such that Leb(@,;) < e~24(!!!
and deg(97) Sp L(z)?|Z|°, with the property that for any 0 ¢ ©; and |m—n| >
[£|/20,

IGr(z,A)(m,n)| < eB < eo aol,
Applying Theorem 4.6 and Corollary 4.3, for any 0 € T, we obtain
#{|j| < Ns 0+ ja mod Z € 07} Sy, (deg @7)°NN~7 (log Nj?

Soi L(z)?Nni+88C-3 (log Ny

~N

= o(N),

which implies that there exists some |j’| < N such that 6 + j’a mod Z ¢ ©;
for sufficiently large N. Consequently,

IGil2,8 + j’a)(m, n)| < eal,
Moreover, by (26) and |J;/| = |Z], it follows that
|Gr,,(z,8)(m, n)| < en alts,

Finally, applying Corollary 3.3 with &(N) = N® where 6 = mG —€, we

conclude

sup(|Xi9|4)(T) < (log T)**.

This completes the proof.

6.2. Proof of Theorem 1.2.

Proof. We present only the essential steps, as the proof is similar to that of
Theorem 1.1.

Fix a small ¢ > 0 and take N sufficiently large. Let C' > 1 be the constant
C(d) from Lemma 2.2 when d = 1. Define an interval J centered at 0 and of
length

|Z| = exp [d(log N)/7]

Applying Theorem 4.6 together with Corollary 4.4, we obtain that for any
deET,

with

#{|j| < N+ 0+ ja mod Z € O;}

San (deg O7)° N (log N)5 exp — (; log v) ")
Sonn L(2)?ON exp [2 log log N — e(log Ny")
= o(N),
which implies that there exists |7’| < N such that
|Gr,,(z,8)(m,n)| < eal,
Applying Corollary 3.4 with U(N) = exp [6 (log N)!/ 7], we conclude

sup(|Xup|b)() < exp f (< a rota logiog) |

< exp (on1sc + €)7 (log log rT).

6.3. Proof of Theorem 1.3.

Proof. We present only the essential steps, as the proof is similar to that of
Theorem 1.1.

Lippe by C > 1 the constant C(d) from Lemma 2.2 when d = 1. Since
oy < on fix a small é€ > 0 such that 5Cy +e < 1. Let N be sufficiently large,
and define an interval J centered at 0 with length

[I| = (log N)”?,

where
6=5Cy+..
