We propose a stringy description of a system composed of two heavy quarks and two heavy
antiquarks, mimicking that in pure SU(3) gauge theory. We present both analytical and numerical
studies of the string configurations for rectangular geometries. As an application, we analyze the
two lowest Born-Oppenheimer potentials. Our results suggest that the ground state of the QQQQ
system is a mixed state of a hadronic molecule and a tetraquark state. For general geometries, we
derive the asymptotic expression for the energy of the tetraquark configuration in the infrared limit
and extend this result to multiquark configurations. Here we also demonstrate the universality of
the string tension.

I. INTRODUCTION

Since the proposal of the quark model by Gell-Mann [1] and Zweig [2], many exotic hadrons have been discovered
3]. However, the long standing question of how quarks are bound inside exotic hadrons still remains open.

The discovery of the J/y meson, consisting of the charm quark and the charm antiquark, in 1974 marked the
eginning of the modern era of high energy physics [4].! Since then, it has taken almost fifty years to observe two
exotic hadrons Ty2cc(6600) and Tyee-c(6900), composed of four charm quarks and known as fully heavy tetraquark
mesons [5].

One approach to the fully heavy tetraquark system is as follows. Given the large quark masses, it seems reasonable
0 apply the Born-Oppenheimer (B-O) approximation, originally developed for use in atomic and molecular physics
6].? Within this framework, the corresponding B-O potentials are defined as the energies of stationary configurations
of the gluon and light quarks fields in the presence of static heavy quark sources. The hadron spectrum is then
determined by solving the Schrédinger equation with these potentials.

The calculation of the B-O potentials is strongly influenced by non-perturbative effects and therefore cannot be per-
formed within perturbative QCD. Although lattice gauge theory is one of the basic tools for studying nonperturbative
henomena in QCD and has made significant progress in the study of the fully heavy tetraquark systems [8-10], the
imited results and the need to understand the physics behind computational complexity motivate the use of effective
field and string theories. A special class of string models, called AdS/QCD (holographic) models, has received much
attention in the last years. The hope is that the gauge/string duality provides new theoretical tools for studying
strongly couple gauge theories.? In these models the string configurations for tetraquarks were discussed qualitatively
in [12, 13]. Nevertheless, the existing literature notably lacks a comprehensive discussion on such systems. Bridging
these gaps is the main objective of the present paper.

The paper continues our study of the QQ and QQQ heavy quark systems [14-16]. It is organized as follows. In
Sec.II, we briefly review some preliminary results and establish the framework for the reader’s convenience. Then in
Secs.III and IV, we construct and analyze string configurations in five dimensions that provide a dual description of
the lowest B-O potentials in the heavy quark limit. Here, we restrict ourselves to the symmetric case, when the quark
sources are located at the vertices of a rectangular. In Sec.V, we examine the two lowest B-O potentials of the system
and also discuss the length scales that characterize transitions between different configurations. These length scales
are related to various types of string interactions, including string junction annihilation. In Sec.VI, we consider the
IR limit for a special class of multiquark string configurations and explores the asymptotic behavior of their energies.
We conclude in Sec. VII with several comments on the implications of our findings and discussing directions for future
work. Appendix A contains our notation and definitions. To make the paper self-contained, Appendices B and C
provide the necessary results on Nambu-Goto strings in five-dimensional space and on the QQ system. Finally, in
Appendices D and E, we discuss the five-dimensional analogs of the tetraquark string configuration.

II. PRELIMINARIES
A. General procedure

To study the fully heavy tetraquark system, we use an approach based on a correlation matrix.‘ In this approach,
the diagonal elements of the matrix are determined by the energies of stationary string configurations, while the
oft-diagonal elements describe transitions between them. The potentials are determined by the eigenvalues of this
matrix.

We begin by specializing to the case of pure SU(3) gauge theory and a geometry in which the quark sources are
placed at the vertices of a rectangle. There are two possible orderings of these sources: type-A ordering, where the
quarks (antiquarks) occupy adjacent vertices, and type-B ordering (bipartite), where each site is connected only to
one quark and one antiquark. Let us start with string configurations in four dimensions, where the string picture has
long been established [17, 18]. The simplest configurations are disconnected (mesonic) ones, as shown in Figures 1 and
2. Each consists of two quark-antiquark pairs joined by strings. We assume that other configurations are constructed

tetraquark configurations, as their five-dimensional analogs turn out to be relevant for describing the first excited B-O
potential.

Transitions between the configurations arise due to string interactions. In Figure 3, we sketch three types of
interactions that will be discussed in the following sections. These represent only a small part of the broader dynamics
of QCD strings. Later, we will introduce the notion of a critical length, which characterizes a transition between two
configurations. This helps to deepen our understanding of the physics of QCD strings, the structure of B-O potentials,
and, importantly, the nature of multiquark states.

B. A short account of the five-dimensional model

In our study of the fully heavy tetraquark system, we will use the formalism mainly developed in [15]. This formalism
is general and can be adapted to any model of AdS/QCD, although we illustrate it by performing calculations in one

4 For more on this in lattice QCD, see [10].
5 Besides string junctions, other possibilities include excited strings and glueball states, which, however, are not relevant here.

of the simplest models, the so called soft wall model. In this model, the background five-dimensional geometry is
chosen to be a one-parameter deformation of Euclidean AdS; space of radius R

(a? + (dx)? + dr?) . (2.1)

Here r denotes the fifth (radial) coordinate, and s is a deformation parameter. The boundary lies at r = 0, while the
soft wall at r = 1/,/s. The wall effectively prevents strings from penetrating deep into the bulk.
Our analysis relies on two key components. The first is a fundamental string governed by the Nambu-Goto action

where ¥ is an induced metric, a’ is a string parameter, and €' are world-sheet coordinates. The second component
is a high-dimensional analogue of the string junction, commonly referred to as the baryon vertex.® In the context of
AdS/CFT, the vertex is a five brane wrapped on an internal space X [19]. From the five-dimensional viewpoint, this
object looks point-like. As shown in [15], the action for the baryon vertex written in the static gauge

yields the results in very good agreement with lattice QCD calculations of the three-quark potential. Actually, S\ert
represents the worldvolume of the brane, assuming 7, = 7;R vol(X) with J; the brane tension. Unlike AdS/CFT, we
treat T, as a free parameter to account for a’-corrections as well as the possible effects of other background fields.”
At zero baryon chemical potential, it is natural to suggest the same action for the antibaryon vertex, such that
Svar, = Svert-

We also need to specify the model parameters. For the purposes of this paper, it is natural to use those from [15],
which were obtained by fitting lattice QCD data for pure SU(3) gauge theory to the string model under consideration.
Accordingly, we set g = pie = 0.176, s = 0.44 GeV”, and k = 3 = —0.083. These values will be used in all subsequent
estimates unless otherwise specified.

Ill. STRING CONFIGURATIONS IN FIVE DIMENSIONS FOR TYPE-A ORDERING

We focus here on the simplest geometry when the quark sources are at the vertices of a rectangle. Without loss of
generality, we can place the rectangle in the xy-plane with its center at the origin and the z- and y-axes serving as
symmetry axes, as shown in Figure 4.

6 We use this terminology, to distinguish between the four-dimensional string junction and its five-dimensional counterpart.
7 In analogy with AdS/CFT, we expect the presence of Ramond-Ramond background fields on X.

In the following analysis, we keep the ratio of length to width fixed, so that

L= Hw (3.1)
with 7 a positive real number. We refer to Eq.(3.1) as the geometrical constraint. It reduces the number of parameters

by one that significantly simplifies the analysis.

A. The disconnected configurations

We begin with the disconnected configurations, each of which can be interpreted as a hadronic molecule composed
of two heavy mesons QQ. We therefore suppose that the energy equals the sum of the rest energies of the quark-
antiquark pairs.* In five dimensions, the configuration consists of two disconnected parts, each having the form shown
in Figure 22 on the right.

1. Configuration (a)

In this case, the quarks and antiquarks are separated by a distance @, and therefore the energy of configuration (a)
is simply
B®) = 2B,a(0), (3.2)
where Egq and £ are given parametrically by Eq.(C.1).

Using the asymptotics for Egg(¢) from Appendix C, we can easily obtain the behavior of EB for small and large
£. Explicitly,

a)
E® (0) = 7 +4e+ o(1), with a® = 2aga, (3.3)

and
B® (0) = 2ol + 2Cgq + O(1). (3.4)
Here agq and Cgq are given by (C.2) and (C.3), respectively, c is a normalization constant, and o = ges is the string

tension [14].
In Figure 5 we plot E®) as a function of ¢. Notably, this function becomes nearly linear for ¢ > 0.6 fm, as

in the case of the QQ system.

2. Configuration (b)

Configuration (b) can be treated similarly, but there is one difference. The quarks and antiquarks are now separated
by a distance \/1 +772. Therefore, the energy is

E) = 2Eoa(V/1 + 7-20). (3.5)

This implies that its asymptotic expansions can be obtained from those in (3.3) and (3.4) by rescaling > \/1+ 7722.
Thus,

for small ¢, and
EO)(€) = 2/1 + Pol + 2Caq + 0(1) e

for large ¢.

We roniaude with an important remark. At finite 7, configuration (b) always has a higher energy than configuration
(a). The reason is as follows. Both functions £+(0,) and E+(0,2) increase monotonically in the interval [0, 1].
For a given ¢, the value of \°>) must be larger than that of A because \/1+7-? > 1. Hence, €+(0,\")) >
€+(0,\@). Consequently, configuration (b) is irrelevant for the ground state potential and contributes only to higher
B-O potentials. While this is obvious for large @, it is less clear for smaller @.

B. The tetraquark configuration

We now turn to the tetraquark configuration (c) in five dimensions. Its form was already suggested in [12], and
here we make it precise. The detailed construction depends nontrivially on 7. In practice, it is convenient to define
two basic configurations, shown in Figure 6, and to construct the tetraquark configuration from them.

Before proceeding, let us make a few comments.

First, the total action governing the tetraquark configuration is the sum of the Nambu-Goto actions for each of the
five strings and the actions for the two vertices

FIG. 6: The basic tetraquark configurations in five dimensions. The baryon vertices are located at r = ry in the bulk, with
Y and Y'’ being their projections onto the x-axis, and 8 = ZYQiQ2. For the tangent angles (see also Figure 20), we use the
symmetry-based abbreviation: a1 = az = G1 = G2 = a and a3 = @. Left: a > 0. The arrows indicate the forces acting on V,
with the gravitational force f directed downward. Right: a < 0. The strings are labeled by 1,...,5.

In Appendix B, it is shown how to extremize the Nambu-Goto actions to find the solutions that describe the strings.
We will explain how to do so for the vertices shortly.
Second, the following simple but useful relations are:

0=|YY|4+ 2sinBlQiY], w = 2cos B|QiY|, (3.9)

valid for 0 < 6 < arctann.
Third, at 8 = , the points Y and Y coincide with the Steiner points of the rectangle. In this case, the length of
SS|+4|Q1S| = (1+ V3n71)é° For n < Ree the Steiner points collapse to the rectangle center.
Finally, if the vertices coincide, basic configuration (I) doesn’t exist, while configuration (II) reduces to the pinched
tetraquark configuration (d). Moreover, we treat the tetraquark configurations (c) and (d) separately because config-
uration (d) also exists for 7 > we where it differs from configuration (c).

the Steiner tree is

1. Strings joining at a baryon vertex

The string solutions described in Appendix B serve as the building blocks for the basic configurations. These blocks,
however, must satisfy certain gluing conditions, which we now describe.

From the physical viewpoint, the gluing conditions express the requirement that the net force vanishes at any vertex
where strings meet, as illustrated in Figure 6 on the left. Translating this into mathematical terms is straightforward:
extremizing the total action of the Nambu-Goto strings and baryon vertices with respect to the location of the vertex
V yields the force balance equation at that vertex

ey +eg+e3+f=0. (3.10)
The corresponding string tensions can be read off from the expressions (B.7) and (B.24)
e, = —gu(ry) (sin 8 cosa, cos 8 cos a, sin a) » €2 = —gu(Tr) (sin B cosa, —cos 8 cosa, sin a) ;

3.11

° Note that the string configurations are not exactly the classical Steiner trees because quarks must connect only to baryon vertices, while
antiquarks connect only to antibaryon vertices.
Note that @ is always nonnegative, as explained in Appendix B.

The gravitational force acting on the vertex is given by f, = — A eect and therefore has only one non-zero
component
e728"
f= (0, 0, To(1 + 4sr2)—— ). (3.12)
r

v

The force balance equations then take the component form

2sin 8 cosa — cosa = 0, 2sina — sind — 3k(1+4u)e*” =0. (3.13)

Obviously, the same analysis applies to the vertex V, with identical tangent angles.

2. Configuration (I)

We begin with configuration (I), characterized by nonnegative tangent angles. Using (B.8) and (B.25), we get
|Qi1Y| = Get (av) and |YY| = GEO, v).- Here A3 is denoted by \. Thus, the geometrical constraint (3.1) takes
the form

L(A, v) = 2(n cos 8 — sin B)L*(a,v), (3.14)

where the functions £ and £L* are defined in Appendix A, and \ = —ProductLog(—ve~"/ cos @), as follows from
(B.16).

The expression for follows from Eq.(3.9) with the help of (3.1), while the energy is obtained from Eqs.(2.3), (B.11)
and (B.26). As a result, we find

—2uv
7

Here c is the normalization constant. When combined with the geometrical constraint and the force balance equations,
this gives the function E£(¢) in parametric form: (= ¢(v) and E = E(v).

Let us now consider the small-¢ behavior of EB. This limit corresponds to v — 0, as follows from the asymptotic
behavior of €*. In this case, the force balance equation and the geometric constraint become

LO Szrre0s BL* (a0) ; BO= evs(4é* (a, v) +E(A, v) + 6k ) +4c. (3.15)

2sin 6 cosa — cosa = 0, 2sina — sina — 3k=0, (3.16)
Veos a B(sin?&, 4, 3) = (1 cos 8 — sin 8) Vcos & B(cos”a, 3, 4), (3.17)

where B(z;a,b) denotes the incomplete beta function. For a given 7, the three angles can be determined from these
equations. Taking the limit v > 0 in Eqs.(3.15) and using Eqs.(A.2), (A.12), and (A.18), we arrive at

a
EOS ~— +4e+o(1), with a” = —2ncosB LF (a) (464 (a) + €o(@) + 6k) g. (3.18)

Here the coefficients £{, Ej and € are defined in Appendix A. The notation &9(@) is used for Eo(cos@). For our
parameter values, the factor 4éy + €) + 6k is negative, and therefore a“ is positive.

It is also instructive to discuss the large-¢ behavior. If 77 is finite, the first equation in (3.15) implies that a = 0 and
v = 1. In this case, string 3 has @ = 0. However, the second equation in (3.13) has no solution with a = @ = 0 in the
interval 0 < vu < 1. Thus, the large-¢ limit does noot exist for finite 7. If 7 is infinite, the limit exists and coincides
with the diquark limit. The point is that in this case string 3 becomes infinitely long, while the others remain finite.
In practice, it is more convenient to use the geometrical constraint w = const to explore the diquark limit. We will
return to this issue in [20].
3. Configuration (II)

Since this configuration is govern by the same action as configuration (I), the force balance equations (3.13) still
apply. The expressions for the geometrical constraint, the length and the energy can be obtained by replacing Lt
and €+ with £~ and E€~ corresponding to negative a. This gives

L(A, v) = 2(n cos 8 — sin B)L~(A,v), (3.19)
and
ay = ay * eo 4
E™ = gys(48-(A,v) + £(A,0) + ok) +4e. (3.20)

Here, due to symmetry, we set \ = Ay = Ag = \y = Ag. For a given 7, these equations, together with Eqs.(3.13),
provide a parametric representation of E as a function of ¢: = ¢(v) and E = E“(v).

The small-¢€ behavior of E(€) can be analyzed in a straightforward way. For v + 0, the force balance equations
(3.16) apply to this case as well, while the geometrical constraint becomes

cos a (sina, 3, 3) = (ncos B — sin 8) Vcos a(1 +1 (sin2a, 3, 3 ) ; (3.21)

where I denotes the regularized Beta function. Given 7, the three angles can be determined from Eqs.(3.16) and
(3.21). We also replace LF and EF with Lp and €> in (3.18), getting

(iD)

EE =— +4ce+o(1), with a = —2ncos B Lo (a) (485 (a) + €o(a@) + 6k) g. (3.22)

Here the coefficients Lj and €, are defined in Appendix A. For brevity, the argument is written as a instead of cosa.

Now we turn to the case of large 0. There are two subcases to consider: \, — 1, where all the strings become
infinitely long, and \ > 1 with fixed \ < 1, where string 3 remains finite in length.

We begin with the former case, which leads to two distinct Steiner points and, as a result, to the term oLyin in
E, From (B.15) it follows that in this limit cosa = cos@ = ve!~” and therefore a = —@. Using this relation, the
second equation in (3.13) can be readily solved, yielding sina = k(1+4v)e~3”. Combining both expressions for a, we
find 1°

1—k?(1 + 4v)?0~% — yet) = 0, (3.23)

whose solution provides the upper bound on v. We denote it by v,. Importantly, v, is independent of 7 and belongs
to the interval [0,1]. Numerically, v, = 0.978. It is noteworthy that in this large-¢ limit the first equation in (3.13)
yields sin 8 = 57 and thus 6 = %. Hence the points Y and Y’ coincide with the Steiner points of the rectangle.

As \, \ + 1, the strings become infinitely long. The singularities arise from the functions £~ and L, as seen from
Eqs.(A.6) and (A.9). With this in mind, we keep only the singular terms in ¢ and E"). The resulting equations are

then

e= ~\/2ina —A)+0(1), 9 B% = ~geys(4In(1 — A) + In(1 — )) + 0(4). (3.24)

The relation between \ and \ follows from the geometrical constraint. Expressing \ in terms of \, we obtain

1-A\=(1—A)V3-!” (3.25)

10 An important point is that this is a general equation. It holds at any vertex where three infinitely long strings meet. For example, in
the QQQ system it was obtained in [15, 16]. We return to this issue in Sec. VI.
Importantly, this relation makes sense only if 7 > a This implies that the Steiner points do not coincide, as expected
when an infinite long string terminates on them. Eliminating the parameter from Eqs.(3.24) then gives

E = (14 v3n)ol + O(1). (3.26)

This is the desired behavior with the minimal length of the string network (Steiner tree) Lmin = (1+ V3n ye.
To find the next-to-leading term, consider the difference between FE“? and oLmin

Taking the limit \,\ > 1 (v > v,) and using the formulas (A.24) and (A.26), we get

Here the functions Z and J are defined in Appendix A. The last term in (3.27) vanishes because the factor 2—sin 8 —
V/3cos 8 behaves like a power law in 1 — A, whereas £~ like a logarithm. Thus,

E —6Lmin = evs(—Az(v, ) = T(r) + 6k ) +4e. (3.28)

Note that, unlike the linear term, the constant term does not depend on 7.

In studying the latter case, we proceed as follows. The angle a is still given by cosa = ve!~”, but this no longer
holds for the angle @, which is now determined by the geometrical constraint. First, since the left hand side of (3.19)
is finite, the factor (7 cos 6 — sin 8) must vanish in this limit that implies tan 8 = 7. Then, the first equation in (3.13)

ss A ACA — 2 1—v ati rt ¢ ait AC ati i 7 a 3 ¢
gives cos @ = Vina . Substituting a and @ into the second equation in (3.13), one finds that

4
2/1 vert) $471 — eer + 3k(1+ 4v)e"3" = 0, (3.30)

which manifestly depends on 7. Accordingly, its solution is 7-dependent and establishes the upper bound on v. We
denote this solution in the interval [0,1] as v,. The allowed range of 7 is governed by the two conditions \ = 1 and
&@ = 0, as discussed in Appendix D.

Using Eqs.(A.6) and (A.16), we obtain the singular terms in ¢ and E

2 In(1—A)

l= +O(1),  B& = —4geys In(1 — A) + O(1). (3.31)

It follows immediately that

B™ =2/1+7-0l + O(1), (3.32)

with the same string tension as before. In this case the length of the string network is equal to twice the length of

the diagonal d= \/1 + 7720.

To compute the next term in the expansion, consider the difference

The notable feature here is that the constant term depends explicitly on the ratio 7.
We have discussed the basic configurations, from which any tetraquark configuration (c) can be constructed. This
construction, however, is cumbersome due to its 7-dependence, so we describe it explicitly in Appendix D.

C. The pinched tetraquark configuration

In contrast to the tetraquark configuration, the pinched tetraquark configuration exists for all values of 7 and is
generally distinct from it.!' Visually, one may think of the pinched configuration as the tetraquark configuration with

string 3 pinched into a point, see Figure 7. It is governed by the action

The factor 2€ (a) + 3k is negative for our parameter values, so the coefficient a is positive.
Next, let us consider the large-¢ behavior. This corresponds to the limit \ > 1, where the tangent angle is given
by cosa = ve!~”. Combining this with (3.38), we get the equation

1—v2er(1-¥) — re +4v)?e7 = 0, (3.41)

IV. STRING CONFIGURATIONS IN FIVE DIMENSIONS FOR TYPE-B ORDERING

The above analysis can be straightforwardly extended to the string configurations with type- B ordering. As before,
the quarks (antiquarks) are placed at the vertices of the rectangle shown in Figure 4, but with Q2 and Qz interchanged.
Obviously, nothing happens with configurations (a) and (d). The main subtlety arises for the analog of configuration
(c). While it is puzzling in four dimensions, in five dimensions a possible resolution is to align string 3 along the radial
direction.

A. The disconnected configuration (b’)

We start with configuration (b’). Here, the quarks and antiquarks are separated by a distance w, and the energy
is given by
12

E®) = 2Ega(n71 0). (4.1)

The function Egq is defined parametrically by ¢ = 216% (0, A) and Ega = 2gV/s E* (0, A) + 2c.
The asymptotic expansions follow directly from the expressions (3.3) and (3.4) after rescaling ¢ > =A Thus, for
small ¢ one finds

BP) = — 22 + 4e + o(1) (4.2)
and for large ¢
(b’) _ 2 4
EW) (e) = wee + 2Caq + o(1). (4.3)

B. The tetraquark configuration (c’)

The problem of constructing the tetraquark configuration for type-B ordering is slightly tricky. One way to do
so is to imagine cutting” the strings attached to the quarks in configuration (c), while keeping those attached to
the antiquarks intact, and then reconnecting them to the quarks reordered according to type-B ordering. The two
resulting configurations are shown in Figure 8.1? An unusual feature is that string 3 is stretched along the r-axis.
When projected onto the ry-plane, it becomes indistinguishable from configuration (d) in Figure (2). This makes the

FIG. 8: Two basic configurations for type-B ordering in five dimensions. The baryon vertices lie on the r-axis, with Y located
at the origin. Because the configuration is symmetric under a permutation of the quarks (antiquarks), we use the shorthand
1 = a2 = a and Q = G2 = @ for the tangent angles. Left: r, > rs. Right: r, = rz. Shown here is a basic configuration (ii)
where a > 0.

tetraquark configuration difficult to visualize in four dimensions.

The total action is again given by the sums of the Nambu-Goto actions and the vertex contributions, as in (3.8) and
(3.36). This tetraquark configuration may be analyzed along the lines of Sec.III by introducing basic configurations
and then constructing the tetraquark configuration from them.

12 A third configuration is obtained from configuration (ii) by changing the signs of the tangent angles of the strings attached to the
antiquarks.
13
1. Configuration (i)

The first basic configuration is shown on the left of Figure 8. We must extremize the corresponding action with
respect to x(r), which describes the string profiles, and with respect to r, and rz, which specify the position of the
vertices. In Appendix B, we outline how this is done for the strings. Varying r, and rj results in the force balance
equations of the form (3.10) at V and V. Due to symmetry, only the r-component is non-zero. Using (B.7) and (B.24)
together with (3.12), we get

Qsina+1—3k(1+4vje%"=0,  2sina— 1 —3k(1+4a)e*” =0 (4.4)

which allow us to express the tangent angles in terms of v and @, where @ = sr?. For the parameters of Sec.II, a is
negative in the interval [0,1] while a is positive.

The form of the expression for ¢ is the same as that in the case of configuration (d). For the energy, however, one
must take into account string 3 and the different tangent angle of the strings attached to the antiquarks. Putting all
together with the help of (B.13), we find

a —2v —20
a Ee) evs(2€-(A,v) + 2€+ (4,0) + Q(v) — Q(a) + 3k—— + 3k) +4e. (4.5)

This is not the whole story. A geometrical constraint arises from the relation |Q,;Y| = |Q,Y|, which yields

ey

L(A, v) = LT (4,3). (4.6)

Using this, one can express & in terms of v and write the energy in parametric form as E = E)(v) and (= €(v).
A numerical analysis shows that, for any given v (except v = 0), there is no solution to Eqs.(4.4) and (4.6) satisfying
v <v. Thus, the basic configuration (i) does not exist for our parameter values.

2. Configuration (ii)

The second basic configuration is shown on the right of the Figure. It may be viewed as configuration (i) with
string 3 pinched into a point, so that ¢ = v but a 4 a. The latter distinguishes it from configuration (d).
In this case, the geometrical constraint (4.6) simplifies to

L(A, v) = £L*(a,v). (4.7)

The force balance equation takes the form of (3.37), with only the r-component non-zero. A simple way to obtain it
is to add the equations in (4.4) and then to set 0 = v. This gives

sina + sin @ — 3k(1+4u)e"*” = 0. (4.8)

The expression for the length in terms of v is the same as in (4.5), but that for the energy becomes

en 2v

7

For a given v, one may determine the tangent angles from the geometrical constraint and the force balance equation.
Numerics, however, shows that there are no solutions with a 4 @. Thus, the basic configuration (ii) also does not
exist.

B® = 2gys(E-(A,v) + E*(G,v) + 3k) + de. (4.9)

14
3. Configuration (iii)

This basic configuration has the same structure as (ii), but with all the tangent angles negative.!° Hence all the
formulas can be obtained by replacing £+ and €+ with L~ and E~, corresponding to negative a. In this way, from
(4.7) we get

L(A, v) =L7(A,v). (4.10)

Note that 4 4 \ because @ 4 a. The above constraint becomes trivial at @ = a, as in configuration (d). Similarly,
for the energy, we have

—2u
(iii) _ - -/j ar&
BMY = reva(€ (A,v) +E (A, v) +k ag ) +4c. (4.11)

Meanwhile, the force balance equation (4.8) remains unchanged.

In principle, the geometrical constraint and force balance equation allow one to express the tangent angles in terms
of v. A simple numerical analysis, however, show that for a given v the only solution has a = @. In other words,
the result reduces to configuration (d). Thus, the basic configuration (iii) also does not exist. We conclude that for
our parameter set configuration (c’) does not exist either. One might suspect that this conclusion holds for other
geometries as well, but this is not the case: configuration (c’) does exist when the diagonals are unequal. A concrete
example is presented in Appendix E. This marks an important difference between four- and five-dimensional string
models.

We can summarize all this by saying that for our parameter values, only three types of configurations exist in the
case of type-B ordering.

V. THE POTENTIALS OF THE QQQQ SYSTEM

We can gain insight into the lowest Born-Oppenheimer potentials by following the approach used in lattice QCD.
Consider a model Hamiltonian, which in the general case is an n x n matrix

BE, :;
H(t) = ne ; (5.1)
0; En

where the diagonal elements represent the energies of string configurations, and the off-diagonal elements describe the
strength of mixing between them. The lowest B-O potentials are given by the smallest eigenvalues of H. Although
in principle the Hamiltonian can be determined from a correlation matrix in lattice QCD, it remains challenging to
compute the off-diagonal elements within the effective string model. Because of this, it is not possible to visualize
the exact shape of the potentials. Nevertheless, valuable insight can be gained by treating ©;; as free parameters,
for example in terms of the approximate magnitudes of the © values near the transition points. In this case, we may
assume that the O’s are approximately constant, with values of about 40-60 MeV, as in [10, 21].

A. The case of type-A ordering

Once the string configurations are constructed in Sec.IH, we will use them to analyze the two lowest B-O poten-
tials, denoted as Vj and V,. However, the complexity of configuration (c) makes the following analysis somewhat
cumbersome.

13 Tt may be thought of as an asymmetric version of configuration (d) with a # a.
14 Importantly, the binding energies of disconnected configurations are encoded in the @’s.
i 0<n<y%

In this range, the tetraquark configuration (c) does not exist that considerably simplifies the analysis. The ground
state potential is provided by configuration (a) and the first excited one by configuration (d), namely Vo = EB) and
V, = E. Thus, if the @’s are small enough, we expect the ground state to correspond to a hadronic molecule.

As an illustration, Figure 9 shows the results of numerical computations for 7 = 0.4. The plots of EB“) and BE) do

not intersect. Although the linear asymptotics (3.7) and (3.44) have the same slopes, their intercepts differ by about
8 MeV.!°

2. Np <7 < 0.5840

As in Appendix D, we skip the very narrow range Aa <7 < ,, where the construction of configuration (c) is
uzzling, and proceed to the next interval. Here the lower bound 7, is defined by (D.1). The ground state potential is
still provided by configuration (a), while the first excited potential by two configurations (c) and (d). Thus, Vo = E@
and V; = min{ BE), 2}, where configuration (d) dominates at small ¢ and configuration (c) at large.!° This does
not change the physical interpretation compared to the previous range: the ground state may still correspond to a
hadronic molecule, depending on the strength of mixing.

As the next example, consider 7 = 0.58. The results are presented in Figure 10. The plots of E© and E@ are
indistinguishable because the difference between them is extremely small. At small ¢, E) is larger than E®, with
he Coulomb coefficients satisfying a) /a‘ = 1— 1.5 x 1073, whereas at large ¢ the situation is reversed, with the
slope ratio 0.5(V73 + )/,/1 +7? = 1-2 x 10~®. The transition between these configurations can be interpreted as
inching (see Figure 3). To make this more quantitative, we define a critical length by equating the energies

EOE) = HOG), (5.2)

and similarly for other transitions. At sufficiently large @, one may estimate the critical length using the linear
asymptotics (3.29) and (3.44). For 1 = 0.58 this yields @. = 13.6fm. Before proceeding further, we note that the
upper bound of this range corresponds to ¢, = 0, where the Coulomb coefficients become equal.

15 This is true for any 7.
16 In this case, it is convenient to approximate the potential V; by Vi = 3 (BO ep E()) = (BO = E@))? + ©?. This is a special case
of (5.1) at n = 2.

3. 0.5840 <  < 1.17937

This range is easier to analyze. The ground state potential is given by configuration (a) and the first excited
potential by configuration (c). Thus, Vy = E@ and V, = E“). As in the previous ranges, we expect the ground state
to be a hadronic molecule.

To illustrate these statements, let us choose 7 = 1. Figure 11 shows the resulting plots.

At the lower bound of this range, the Coulomb coefficients of E@) and E©) coincide, implying an intersection point
between them at ¢ = 0. The coordinate of the intersection point increases with 7. This implies that a transition
occurs between these configurations, which can be interpreted as the process of string junction annihilation. As before,
we define the critical length by equating the energies, E@) = E©). At the upper bound, the Coulomb coefficients
of E@ and E“ coincide, indicating another intersection at £ = 0. The potentials are therefore described by two
configurations (a) and (c) as Vo = min{B@), ©} and V; = max{E®), E\)}. This suggests that the ground state is
no longer a pure state but a mixed state of a hadronic molecule and a tetraquark state.

As an illustration, Figure 12 shows the results of numerical computations for 7 = 1.3. Here the critical length is
é, = 0.199fm. For larger ¢, configuration (c) has a higher energy, while for smaller ¢ the energy of configuration (a)
is higher.

5. 1.484792 <n < V3

As 7 increases, the intersection points between E@ and E® as well as between E® and E shift to larger
values of ¢. At the upper bound, the slopes of E@ and E© become equal and, as a consequence, their plots no
longer intersect at finite @. This leads to a rather entangled pattern of the energies, as illustrated in Figure 13 on the
left. The ground state potential is described by configurations (a) and (c), while ne first excited potential involves
configurations (a), (c), and (d). Explicitly, Vo = minfB@, BO} and V; = minfB, BO, BO }.17 Hence, the ground
state is expected to be a mixed state, involving both hadronic and tetraquark tie

£. = 0.080 fm, respectively. Both transitions can be interpreted as string junction annihilation.

6. V3<n

In this range, E“ does not intersect with the others, while E@ and E@) intersect with each other. Thus, the
ground state potential is given simply by Vo = E“) and the first excited one by V; = min{E), B®}. Because of
this, we expect the ground state to correspond to a tetraquark state.

17 The minimum in Vo must be taken first.
18

We illustrate this with the example 7 = 2. Figure 14 shows the corresponding numerical results. The transition
between configurations (a) and (d) occurs at ¢_ = 0.156fm and can be interpreted as string junction annihilation.

B. Type-B ordering

As we saw in Sec.IV, the tetraquark configuration does not exist for this ordering of the quark sources. This,
together with an additional symmetry, constitutes a special feature that significantly simplifies the following analysis.
On the other hand, the analog of configuration (b), namely configuration (b’), now becomes relevant for the potential

Vi.

1. 0<n < 0.6969651

A numerical analysis shows that in this range, the ground state potential is described by a single configuration,
(a), whereas the first excited potential involves two configurations, (b’) and (d). In the latter case, the tetraquark
(pinched) configuration dominates at small ¢, while configuration (a) dominates at large ¢. The transition between
them occurs due to string junction annihilation. So, we have Vo = E, and V,; = min{Ey, Ey}, and we expect the
ground state to be a hadronic molecule.

characterizing the transition between configuration (b’) and (d) is given by ¢. = 0.078 fm.

2. 0.6969651 <n <1

As 7 increases, the critical length ¢, decreases and eventually vanishes at 7 = 0.6969651, where the Coulomb
coefficients a?) and a) become equal. This defines the lower bound. For larger values of 7, E“’) and E® no longer
intersect. Hence, Vo = E, and Vi = Ey. In this case, the ground state is also expected to correspond to a hadronic
molecule.

As a typical example, consider 1 = 0.85. Figure 16 shows the resulting plots.

At 7 = 1, the rectangle becomes a square, and hence configurations (a) and (b’) are indistinguishable. The potentials
are then simply given by Vo = Ey and V, = Eq. Thus, the ground state remains a hadronic molecule.

The behavior of the potentials for larger values of 7 can be understood purely on symmetry grounds. The key point
is that for type-B ordering there is an additional symmetry which exchanges the length and the width. It acts on 7
and ¢ as 7 > 71 and @ > n~12, with a fixed point at 7 = 1. In terms of configurations, the symmetry exchanges the
20

meson configurations B® and E>) 18

In this description, the range 0.6969651 < 7 < 1 is mapped to 1 < 7 < 1.43479. The corresponding potentials are
simply Vo = Ey and V; = E,. Therefore, as before, the ground state is expected to be a hadronic molecule. For
illustration, the resulting plots for 7 = 1.2 are shown in Figure 17.

Similarly, the range 7 < 0.6969651 is mapped to the range 1.43479 < n. The potentials are then written as
VY = E®) and Yj = minf{E@), BO}. For V4, the tetraquark configuration dominates at small ¢, as in the range
7 < 0.6969651. The ground state is again expected to correspond to a hadronic molecule. As an example, we choose
7 = 2. The corresponding plots are shown in Figure 18. The transition between configurations (a) and (d) occurs at

VI. THE IR LIMIT OF SOME STRING CONFIGURATIONS AND STEINER TREES

Consider now the general case in which N quark sources are placed at arbitrary points on the boundary of the
five-dimensional space. We impose several restrictions on a string configuration connecting these sources. First, we
assume that the configuration is connected. Second, it is tree, meaning that it contains no string loops. We also
assume that in the IR limit, when the quark sources are infinitely separated, its projection onto the boundary forms
a regular Steiner tree whose Steiner points do not coincide either with each other or with the sources. The physical
meaning of the last assumption is straightforward: in such a limit, all strings become infinitely long, so that baryon
vertices are infinitely separated from one another and from the quark sources.

Within the present model, the asymptotic expansion of the energy can be easily obtained. The leading term comes
from the strings. Summing over them gives

Exg = oLmin + o(1) , (6.1)

where Lyin is the length of the Steiner tree. Importantly, the string tension is universal: it is the same for all the
strings, as follows from the asymptotic formulas (B.23) and (B.27). This is the well-known asymptotic behavior. Our
goal is to determine the leading correction to it.%

Before getting to arbitrary N, recall that for N = 3 the desired correction was computed in [15, 16]. Explicitly,

=2v1

Csq = 3c — ev3(3Z(v.) — 3ko

x ) ; (6.2)

18 In the literature, such an exchange is referred to as a flip-flop of strings [22]. It is, in fact, a special case of string reconnection (see Figure
3). Although the flip-flop is hidden when the constraint £/w = const is imposed, it becomes manifest under the constraint w = const
and has been observed in lattice simulations (see, e.g., [23] and reference therein). We will return to this issue in [20].

19 We will not discuss the leading term in detail here. There exists a vast literature on the Steiner tree problem. See, e.g., the book [24]
and references therein.
21

Here v, is a solution to Eq.(3.23), and c is the normalization constant, as before. Two important remarks are in order.
First, (6.2) is meaningful only if none of the triangle’s angles formed by the quarks exceeds an. In other words, the
Steiner tree is regular.2? Second, the correction is universal in the sense that it does not depend on the triangle’s
angles.

The case N = 4 may be analyzed in a similar way. The corresponding string configuration resembles those of Figure
6, but with the quark sources placed at arbitrary points on the boundary. Consider the force balance equation (3.10)
at V. It is convenient to decompose the vectors e as e = (€,e,), where e, is the radial component, and the remaining
x, y, and z components are grouped into é. Then |é] = gw(r,) cosa and e, = —gw(r,)sina, as follows from (B.7)
and (B.24). The force balance equation can then be written in component form as 74

6 +6+63 =0, sina, + sinag — sinag = 3k(1+ 4v)e78” : (6.3)

As explained in Appendices A and B, string 1 becomes infinitely long as its \ parameter approaches 1. In this IR limit,
its tangent angle at the baryon vertex is negative and given by cosa; = ve!~” (see Eq.(B.15)). The same argument
applies to the two remaining strings, yielding a; = a2 = —a3. Consequently, all the vectors ¢ have the same length.
This implies that the angles between them must be oa to satisfy the first equation in (6.3), and therefore the point
Y coincides with the Steiner point $. Moreover, from the second equation it follows that sina, = k(1 + 4v)e7%".
Combining this with the above expression for cos a leads directly to Eq.(3.23), whose solution is v,. Clearly, the same
argument can be applied to the vertex V to show that its projection Y coincides with the second Steiner point S$. The
important consistency condition is that both vertices are equidistant from the boundary, namely at r = \/v,/s. The
asymptotic expression for the energy of the four external strings (ending on the quark sources) is given by (B.22),
while that for the internal string (ending only on the vertices) is given by (B.27). So after summing over the strings
and adding the vertex contributions, we arrive at

eo 2v1

Wn

which includes the universal constant term. The expression (3.29) obtained in Sec.III for the rectangular geometry is
a special case of (6.4).

Technically, the case N = 5 differs from the previous one only by the numbers of strings and vertices. Using
essentially the same arguments, one can show that in the IR limit the projections of the vertices on the boundary
correspond to the Steiner points, and all the vertices lie at the same distance from the boundary. A typical Steiner
tree is sketched in Figure 19. In this case, summing over the strings and the vertices gives

20 In this case, the Fermat point of the triangle does not coincide with any of its vertices.
21 String 3 is internal, as it is stretched between the baryon vertices. Its tangent angle is always positive (see Appendix B).
22
We are now in a position to write down the formula for arbitrary N:

eo 2y1

Exq = oLmin + Cyqg+0(1), with Cyg=Ne- evs(NZ(v) +(N —3)7(v,) — 3(N —2)k ) , N>2. (66)

Vn

This is the main result of this Section. Note that the above formula applies to the QQ system, where C.q reduces to
Caq defined in (C.3). However, it should be stressed that the result is valid for a specific class of string configurations
rather than for the ground state potentials of the multiquark systems.

We conclude our discussion with a few remarks.

(1) In [15] it was noted that the constant terms appearing in the expansions of the energy of the QQQ system at
small and large quark separations are different. More precisely, the constant term in the IR limit is smaller than that
in the UV. The same feature holds for the string configurations considered above, with Nc being the constant term in
the UV. It is noteworthy that the difference between these constants is well-defined (scheme-independent), and can be
straightforwardly estimated using (6.6). For a few small values of N, we get 3c—C3q = 267 MeV, 4c— Cig = 359 MeV,
and 5¢ — Cyq = 450 MeV.

(2) If the normalization constant c is chosen to be sufficiently large so that the first term dominates in Cyg, then

Ca ~const, N>2. (6.7)

For N < 5, such a relation has been observed on the lattice [23]. Since the parameter values used here were
obtained by fitting the lattice data for the three-quark potential [15], it is worth making some estimates. We obtain

90 — 0.535 GeV, G2 = S19 — 2 — 0.533 GeV, and 2 = 0.531 GeV as N 00.

(3) Another special choice is to set c= g/SsIo. In this case, the following relations hold ??

With our parameter values, we find c = 88 MeV and Cyq = —4 MeV.

(4) There are other IR limits in which some of the strings remain of finite length or even shrink to points. In such
limits, the corresponding Steiner points coincide with each other or with given points (quark positions), as discussed
in Sec.II and in [16]. These limits are more complex and generally do not yield universal constant terms.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We conclude our discussion of the fully tetraquark system with several remarks.

(1) The results of Sec.V suggest that the ground state of the QQQQ system is a mixed state of a hadron molecule
and a tetraquark state, although for type-B ordering they indicate to a purely hadronic molecule state.

(2) In general, the tetraquark and pinched tetraquark configurations are distinct and may coexist. In terms of
string interactions in ten dimensions, a transition between them can be interpreted as the creation or decay of a
brane-antibrane bound state. For the type-B ordering, configurations (c’) and (d’) are indistinguishable in four
dimensions but become distinguishable in five dimensions, as explained in Appendix E. This is puzzling and warrants
further study. Hopefully, this will shed light on the five-dimensional origin of QCD strings [25].

(3) For the class of the string configurations discussed in Sec. VI, we can deduce from (6.6) that

3 : 7 N>3 (7.1)

Coe Guy NAB, Guy
N 2 N J

This is a general relation which is well-defined (ie., scheme independent). It is obviously satisfied if Exa = const,

and (6.8) is its special case. It will be interesting to test this prediction through high precision computer simulations.

22 The relation Cig = 2C3q was suggested by Z. Komargodski.
23

(4) In general, for the rectangular geometry the potentials are complicated functions of both length and width. In
this work we imposed the constraint ¢ = nw to simplify the analysis. Another option, used in lattice QCD, is to fix
w = const. This is convenient for studying the diquark limit (7 — oo) but is less suitable for exploring the UV and
IR limits. We plan to return to this issue in future work [20].

(5) In the light of the recent discovery of the Tezcz(6600) and Tyzcz(6900) mesons at the LHC, understanding the
properties of the tetraquark systems has become a matter of primary importance. The QQQQ system exhibits a
rich and complex landscape of physics, with many open questions yet to be answered. Advancing our theoretical
understanding and connecting it to hadron spectroscopy will require a concerted effort from the high-energy physics
community. We hope this study provides useful insights and motivation for future research.

Appendix A: Notation and useful formulas

Throughout this paper, we denote heavy quarks (antiquarks) by Q(Q) and baryon (antibaryon) vertices by V(V).
Heavy quark sources are always located on the boundary of the five-dimensional space at r = 0, while vertices are
located in its interior at r =r, (rz). For convenience, we introduce the dimensionless variables v = sr? and 0 = sr?,
which take values in the interval [0,1] and quantify the proximity of these objects to the soft wall, located at 1 in
such units.

To present the resulting formulas in a compact form, we make use of the basic functions introduced in [26], together
with several newly defined ones:

(i) The function £+ is defined as

is

Here B(z;a,b) = B(a,b) + B(z;a,b). At y = 1 it exhibits a logarithmic singularity

Lo (y,%) =—In(l—y)+O(1), at fixed x. (A.6)

Appendix B: Static Nambu-Goto strings with fixed endpoints

The aim here is to describe some facts about static Nambu-Goto strings in the curved geometry (2.1), which are
essential for constructing the string configurations discussed in Secs.III and IV. Some of this material is not new and
can be found in [15], whose notation we largely adopt.
26

1. A static string with one endpoint on the boundary

Consider a static string stretched between two fixed points in the xr-plane, as shown in Figure 20.

FIG. 20: A string stretched between two points, Q(0,0) and V(é,r,), where r, < 1/\/s. The tangent angle at V is denoted
by a, and the arrows indicate the forces acting on this point. The left and right panels show the cases for a > 0 and a < 0,
respectively.

In static gauge, where €! = t and €? = z, the boundary conditions for r(x) describing the string profile are

r(0)=0,  r()=re. (B.1)

The Nambu-Goto action (2.2) takes the form

sr?

e
S=Tg [ dx w(r)/1+ (Orr)? , w(r) = = F (B.2)

For convenience, we use the shorthand notation g = se. ££ = ifs dt, and 0,r = or, Since the integrand does not

depend explicitly on x, the equation of motion admits the first integral

fo) _ (B.3)

Jit (ur?

At point V, it can be written as

I=w/(ry) cosa, (B.4)

where tana = 0,r|,=¢ and a € [a5 a
In this paper, point Q is associated with an infinitely heavy quark, while point V with a baryon vertex. It is
therefore natural to consider the forces acting on V in order to maintain equilibrium. The force balance equation is

simply

e+f=0, (B.5)
where e is the string tension and f is an external force (see the Figure). It is straightforward to compute the r-

component of e, which arises from the boundary term in the variation of the action. Indeed, with dr|,-¢ = dry, we
find that

Ory (B.6)
27

which implies e, = —T~165/dr, = —gw(r,) sina. Similarly, in static gauge £1 = t and €? = r, the boundary term
provides the x-component: e, = —gw(r,) cosa.?? Putting both components together, we have
e = —gw(ry)(cosa, sina) . (B.7)

A simple but important observation is that the magnitude of the tension is determined by a radial coordinate,
specifically |e] = gw(r).

In general, the tangent angle a may be positive or negative. For a > 0, the function r(x) describing a string profile
monotonically increases on the interval (0, 4]. Conversely, for a < 0, the situation is more intricate: r(x) increases on
(0, zo] and decreases on [2o, 4], reaching a local maximum at x = zy. Both cases are depicted in Figure 20.

Let us examine these cases more systematically, starting with a > 0. First, we express J in terms of a and ry.
This yields the differential equation w(r,,) cosa = w(r)/\/1 + (0,r)?, which can be integrated over x and r. Using
the boundary conditions (B.1), we obtain

where v = sr?, and the function £* is defined in Appendix A.
To compute the string energy, we reduce the integral over x in S to an integral over r using the differential equation.
Since the resulting expression diverges at r = 0, we regularize it by imposing a short-distance cutoff €. This gives

Here €+ is defined in (A.11), and c is a normalization constant.
It is worth noting that for a = 5, the above expressions simplify to

£=0; E=gvVsQ(v) +c, (B.12)

where Q is defined in Appendix A. In this case, the string is stretched entirely along the radial direction. If both
endpoints lie in the bulk, the second expression becomes

E = gy5(Q(v) — Q@)). (B.13)

Here 0 = sr2 such that r, > rz.

The above analysis extends straightforwardly to the case a < 0. A key point, relevant for all formulas below, is that
the string configuration involves two segments: one over the interval [0,2], where r(a) increases, and another over
the interval [x,, |, where r(x) decreases (see Figure 20). First, we define the first integral at r = r, so that I = w(r,),
and then integrate the differential equation over both intervals. This yields

23 Alternatively, one can choose a gauge in which the boundary terms provide both components [15].

Here \ = sr?, and L~ is defined in (A.4). Importantly, 4, v, and @ are not independent. From the first integral it
follows that

v

— = — cosa (B.15)
v

which allows us to express \ in terms of v and a as

A = —ProductLog(—ve~"/ cosa) . (B.16)
Here ProductLog(z) is the principal solution for w in the equation z = we" [27].

As before, the string energy is computed by first rewriting the integral over x in S' as an integral over r and imposing
the short-distance cutoff on r. A direct calculation gives

To obtain a finite result, we subtract the + term and take « — 0, yielding

(B.18)
where c is the same normalization constant introduced earlier. The function €~ is defined in Appendix A.

Finally, let us discuss the large-¢ behavior. In doing so, it is convenient to start with a < 0. In this case the
large-£ limit corresponds to A + 1. From this, it follows that v and @ are not independent but subject to the
constraint ve!~” = cosa. Explicitly, for a given a, the corresponding v is vq = —ProductLog(—cosa/e). The leading
contributions to ¢ and E arise from the logarithmic terms. From Eqs.(A.6) and (A.16), we immediately find

This leads to the standard result

E=o0l+0(1), with o = ges. (B.20)

Here oc is the string tension. To extract the subleading term, consider the difference

-—ol= gVs(E~ (A,v) — eL7(A, v)) + (B.21)

Taking \ > 1 (v > vq) and using (A.24), we obtain

E=ol+c—gysZ(vo) + 0(1). (B.22)
For a > 0, the only way to reach infinite string length is to take v > 1 at a = 0. This implies vq = 1, so (B.22)
reduces to
E=ol+c-—gVsly+0(1). (B.23)
Here we used the fact that Z(1) = Ip.
29
2. A static string with endpoints in the bulk

Now consider a static string stretched between two points in the bulk at the same radial coordinate, as shown in
Figure 21. In this case the string profile is symmetric about « = ¢/2. Clearly, external forces are required to keep the

string in equilibrium. On symmetry grounds, we indicate only the forces acting at V. The force balance equation
takes the same form as Eq.(B.5), with the string tension given by

e = gu(r,) (cosa, sina) (B.24)

This expression for e follows from Eq.(B.7), with e replaced by —e.

The length of the string can be obtained in the standard way, by integrating the differential equation with respect
to x and r, subject to the boundary conditions r(x,) = r(zs) = ry. Alternatively, it can be derived by considering
two strings with upper endpoints at V and V, and lower endpoints on the boundary. Subtracting the length of the
first string from that of the second yields

1 a
C= 15 -ty race £*(a,v)) 2/2 f git — ut er-)) 4 ele): (B.25)

The energy can be computed in a similar way, giving

E=gVs(€(A,v) — Et (a,0)) = rs [ - ew (1 —u exa-w))F = gVsE(r,v), (B.26)

where the incomplete £ and € functions are defined in Appendix A. In our derivation, we used the relation cosa =
ger”, Note that no regularization is needed in (B.26), as the integral is finite.

Finally, let us discuss the large-¢ limit, which corresponds to \ > 1. As before, we consider two strings but now
with upper endpoints at V and at the turning point (xo,ro). From (B.22) and (B.23), it follows immediately that

E=ol-gvVsJ (va) +0(1), (B.27)

where in the last step we used (A.25). Note that o is the same as in (B.23). This is an important feature of the soft
wall model. Its physical meaning is clear: the physical string tension is determined by the expression (B.7) or (B.24)
evaluated precisely at the soft wall’s position, r = 1/,/s. The wall effectively prevents strings from penetrating deeper
into the bulk.

Appendix C: Some details on the QQ system

This Appendix provides a brief summary of key results concerning the heavy quark-antiquark potential, which
represents the ground state energy of a static quark-antiquark pair. These results are relevant to the discussions in
Secs.III and IV. For standard explanations, see [14], whose conventions we follow unless otherwise stated.

configuration for mesons [17]. In five dimensions, this configuration transforms into the one shown on the right. It

involves a string attached to the heavy quark sources on the boundary of five-dimensional space, but in this case a
gravitational force pulls the string into the interior [28].

For a Nambu-Goto string in the background geometry (2.1), the relation between the string energy and the quark
separation distance is given parametrically as

while the large-¢ behavior is

Here o is the string tension, and Jp is defined in Appendix A. It is worth noting that the coefficients ogq and a are
different, with their ratio given numerically by oqq/o0 = 0.805. Furthermore, the difference between the constant
terms in the small- and large-¢ expansions is 2c — Cgq = 175 MeV, showing that the constant term in the small-
expansion is larger.

Appendix D: A detailed description of configuration (c)

For a given 7, configuration (c) can be constructed from the basic configurations of Sec.III. However, the construction
becomes intricate when it involves multiple transitions between these basic configurations. In this Appendix, we

describe configuration (c) and some of its properties, under the assumption that 7 is not very close to won

1. The limiting values of v

As explained in Sec.III, the limiting values of the parameter v, denoted as v,, vj, and v,, are the solutions to
Eqs.(3.23), (3.30), and (3.41). Here we examine how these solutions behave as functions of 7.

A quick way to proceed is by numerical analysis. The results are shown in Figure 23. The solutions v, and v,, exist
for all 7 and take values in the interval [0,1]. A simple calculation yields v, = 0.978 and v, = 0.967. In contrast,
the solution v,, exists only in the very narrow interval Wa <1 </7,.74 These bounds can be better understood by

considering configuration (c). The lower bound corresponds to \ = 1, where string 3 becomes infinitely long and the
second large ¢ limit reduces to the first one. The upper bound corresponds to @ = 0, where string 3 collapses to a
point, transforming configuration (c) into configuration (d). It can be expressed in terms of v, as

yp = (D.1)

4v2
P

2. Some preliminary comments

As we saw in Sec.III, the large-¢ limit of configuration (c) does not exist if 7 < 1/3. The same is also true for the
small-¢ limit. A numerical analysis shows that the geometrical constraints (3.17) and (3.21), together with the force
balance equations (3.16), have no solutions unless @ = 0, which corresponds to configuration (d). Because of these
issues, no physically meaningful tetraquark configuration exists for 7 < He

A useful tool for studying transitions between the basic configurations of Sec.III is the function

fn(v) = 1 = 2(n cos 8 — si 8) a) ‘ (D.2)

whose zeros are the solutions of the equation a(v) = 0 if \(v) and B(v) are defined by

Lt (0,v)

sin@ = —3k(1 + 4v)e"3”, sin B = 50s. (D.3)

Clearly, at zero values, Eq.(D.2) reduces to the geometric constraint (3.14). These zeros play an important role in
analyzing the tetraquark configuration, as they correspond to transitions between configurations (I) and (II).

The interval a <<, is somewhat puzzling. It appears that within this range, there exists two string configura-
tions whose large- expansions correspond to the different limits of configuration (II). In particular, the configuration
with the linear asymptotics (3.29) dominates at very large ¢ (greater than 2000 fm), whereas the configuration with
the linear asymptotics (3.35) dominates at smaller @. Thus suggests that configuration (c) is effectively a superposition
of the two. We will not pursue this issue further, as the interval is very narrow and irrelevant for determining the
ground state potential of the QQQQ system. It matters only for the excited states.

3. The range 7, < 7 < 0.7884

We are interested in the zeros of f,(v) in the interval 0 < v < v,. Numerical analysis shows that this function
has no zeros, except for a single one at 7 = 0.7884. For illustration, we plot fy as a function of v in Figure 24 on
the left. However, this zero has no effect on the form of the tetraquark configuration, which is described entirely by
configuration (II). Its energy is given parametrically by

This is significantly smaller than ¢ > 0.6fm observed for configuration (a), where E@ becomes nearly linear (see
Figure 5).

4. The range 0.7884 < 7 < no

In this range, the function f,(v) has two zeros, as shown by a straightforward numerical analysis. At the upper
bound, however, it has an additional zero at v = 0. The value of 79 can be computed analytically, with the result

As an example, let us take 7 = 0.815. For this value, the zeros are Vo, = 0.0914, vo2 = 0.3084, and vo, = 0.8088.

6. The range 0.8204 < 7

Finally, consider the range 0.8204 < 7. As seen from Figure 27, the function f, has a single zero, except at
n = 0.8404, where it has two. However, this does not affect the tetraquark configuration. So, the energy can be
written in parametric form as

As a concrete example, consider 7 = 1. In this case, the zero is given by v) = 0.9102. The functions f,, and E©)
are plotted in Figure 27. A notable feature is that E‘ becomes near linear for slightly larger values of ¢, namely for
£>0.4fm. This has a natural explanation: as 7 — 00, the function E© tends to Ea, Where such a behavior occurs
for ¢ 2 0.6 fm (see Figure 5).

7. The Coulomb and quark-quark couplings

Assuming that at sufficiently small separations the energy of the tetraquark configuration is due to pairwise quark
interactions, the leading approximation to the energy takes the form

(ce) 1 1 Ags
OQ. "4 on 222 _ (44 a8 4
E 7 tO) = 205 s(44 aa) 7 +O(1). (D.9)

In general, both agg and agg may depend on 7 and differ from their counterparts in the QQ and QQQ systems.”°

Having computed the Coulomb coefficient a), we would like to estimate the quark-quark coupling that appears in
(D.9). This, however, is impossible without making an additional assumption on aq. There are two ways to do so.
The first way is to assume the relation agq = 2aqq.7’ With this, one gets

al?) D
QQq = 7: 10
08 Tone Tas ( )
The second way is to assume that agq is the same as in the QQ (meson) system. This yields
1 1
etn = z (20 - (1 + —)« a) ; D.11

where Qgq is defined in (C.2).

The results of our estimates are summarized in Table I. Importantly, for the considered values of 7, the small-
behavior of the potential Vo is determined by configuration (c) that makes our estimates also applicable to the ground
state potential as well. As seen from the Table, both quark-quark couplings are close to 5 and depend weakly on
n. While the former behavior was observed in lattice QCD using the approximation (D.10) [9], the latter is our
prediction, which will hopefully be testable in future numerical simulations. The expressions (D.10) and (D.11), in
turn, provide reasonable approximations for the 7-dependent Coulomb coefficient a).

26 In the QQQ system, agq is not constant but depends weakly on the angles of a triangle formed by the quarks [15, 16].

Appendix E: The tetraquark configuration (c’) for rhombus geometry

Our goal here is to clarify that the tetraquark configuration exists for type-B ordering. To proceed, instead of a
rectangle, we consider a rhombus in the xy-plane with its center at the origin, as shown in Figure 28. We also impose

FIG. 28: A rhombus of length L. The quarks and antiquarks are placed at its vertices according to type-B ordering, with point
Y at the origin.

the geometrical constraint

IY] =d|Qiy|, (E.1)

which fixes one of the rhombus angles. A simple but useful relation is L = V/1+ d?|QiY|.

The tetraquark configuration (c’) can be analyzed along the lines of Sec.IV, with the only modification arising from
the above constraint. We begin by describing the basic configurations and next illustrate the construction with a
concrete example.

1. Configuration (i)

The basic configuration (i) is similar to that shown in Figure 8. Thus, we have v > 0, a1 = @2 =a, and @ = @2 = 4,
as before. The force balance equations (4.4) remain valid, as does the expression for the energy given by the second
equation in (4.5). The expression for the length is easily obtained using Eq.(B.14) for |QiY]|. So,

y _ VIF i) _ a ) 4 a.v) 4 ) B) + 3k° + 3ko t
19 = Te (A,v), BO = gys(2e (A,v) +2€+(a,0) + Q(v) — Q(v) + 3k a + 3K) tde. (E.2)

Similarly, for the geometric constraint we get

L*(a,0) =dL (A, v), (E.3)
36

which is a light modification of (4.6). The tangent angles and parameter v can be expressed in terms of v using
the force balance equation and the geometrical constraint. As a result, the energy as a function of L can be written
parametrically as L = L(v) and B = BE (v).

It is instructive to consider the behavior of E® at small L, which corresponds to the limit v > 0. Taking this limit

rN
in (E.3), with the help of Eqs.(A.2) and (A.5), one finds 0 = (a=) v. This restricts the allowed values of d to

cos@ 1+ I(sin? a, 3, 3) ;

cosa I (cos? a

as v > U by construction. To make a simple estimate of the upper bound, note that the values of the tangent angles
are determined by Eqs.(4.4) at v = 0 = 0. Using those, we get d < 0.407.78 The energy behaves for L > 0 as

al)

EG =- Z t4eto(l), with al) =— V1 +d? |d Lp (a)(2E5 (a) = 1+ 3k) + £5 (a) (26¢ (@) +1+3k) a, (E.5)

exhibiting the leading Coulomb term.

2. Configuration (ii)

This basic configuration is similar to that shown on the right in Figure 8, with @ > 0. The force balance equation
(4.8) remains unchanged. The expressions for the length and energy follow from (E.2) and (4.9):

-” EVA 2 a —2v
L@ = and L(A,v), EW = 2evs(E-(A, v) +€+(a,v) +3k= 7a ) +4e. (E.6)

The geometrical constraint now reads

Lt(a,v) =dL(A,v), (E.7)
which is obtained from (E.3) by setting ¢ = v. After extracting the tangent angles from the force balance equation
and the geometrical constraint, the energy can again be written in parametric form as L = L“)(v) and BE = BE“) (v).

3. Configuration (iii)

The only difference from configuration (ii) is that @ is negative. Therefore, all the formulas can be obtained from
those of configuration (ii) by replacing £+ and €+ with £~ and €~. In this way, from (E.6) we obtain

e72v

V1+@

pai) =

L-(A,v), BOD = 2gys(E-(A,v) + E-(A,v) + 3k) + de, (E.8)

and from (E.7)

LO (A,v) =d£-(A,v). (E.9)

The force balance equation (4.8) remains valid. Again, the angles can be expressed in terms of v, and the energy can
be written parametrically as L = L“)(v) and BE = EB“) (vy),

Finally, let us briefly discuss the large-L behavior, which corresponds to the limit A,A > 1. It follows then from
Eq.(B.15) that cosa = cos@ = ve!~”, Thus, in this limit configuration (c’) approaches to configuration (d) of Secs.III

37

and IV. This implies that the upper bound on v is v,, defined by (3.41), and the expansions (3.44) can be rewritten
as

l+d
v1l+dé

Here the first term is proportional to the total length of the rhombus diagonals.

ES) = 9 oL+C® + o0(1). (E.10)

4. An example

We now describe a concrete example, namely d = a in which one can explicitly construct the tetraquark configu-

ration from the basic configurations. As it turns out, E©’) is a piecewise function of L, given by

EX), O<v<¥
vite “ SUSY y
pat’ ey, EO al Bw!) F<0K<v, (E.11)

vs EG) (y) » VoSv<y,.

Here V = 0.399 and v, = 0.929. The first value corresponds to the transition between configurations (i) and (ii), which
occurs when the vertices collide, i.e., v = 0. The second value corresponds to the transition between configurations
(ii) and (iii), which occurs at a = 0.

To complete the picture, we also present an analog of the pinched tetraquark configuration, constructed from the
two basic configurations (ii) and (iii). Explicitly,

2 ; (ii) <vu<w.,
Vlsee ), ana fF (ve), OS v<w, (E.12)

vs ies Ev), vo Su Sv.
Note that configuration (d’) is antisymmetric in the sense that a # @ unless v = v,. Clearly, these configurations differ
only for L < L(¥), due to the difference between the basic configurations (i) and (ii). In Figure 29 we plot BE‘) (L)
and B(?)(L). For L < 0.395 fm, the plots corresponding to configurations (i) and (ii) are indistinguishable, as the

respectively. In addition, the dotted blue curve represents configuration (ii) for L < 0.395 fm, which forms part of configuration
(d’) in this interval.

difference between them is extremely small. However, a more detail analysis shows that configuration (c’) has a lower
energy than configuration (d’). Note that configuration (i) transforms into configuration (ii) at L = 0.395 fm when
the baryon vertices collide. From the perspective of ten-dimensional string theory, this corresponds to the creation
38

of a brane-antibrane bound state. A similar pinching effect has also been observed in the doubly heavy tetraquark
systems [29].
