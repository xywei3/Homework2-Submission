(Dated: October 29, 2025)

We demonstrate that frustrated spin textures can generate anisotropic Josephson couplings
between d-vectors that can stabilize spatially varying pairing orders in spin triplet superconductors.
These couplings depend on the relative orientation of d-vectors, analogous to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
and I’-type interactions in magnetism, leading to an effective “pliability” of the pairing order that
competes with superfluid stiffness. Such couplings cannot originate from spin-orbit coupling; rather,
they can arise, for example, when itinerant electrons are coupled to a local exchange field composed
of frustrated spin moments. Using a T-matrix expansion, we show that coupling to a local exchange
field leads to an effective tunneling of itinerant electrons that is dependent on the underlying spin
configurations at the barrier between superconducting grains. Furthermore, Josephson tunneling
through frustrated spin textures can produce a Josephson diode effect. The diode effect originates
either from nonvanishing spin chirality in the barrier, or from antisymmetric Josephson coupling

between noncollinear d-vectors, both of which

I. INTRODUCTION

The interplay between frustrated magnetism and
unconventional superconductivity is an emerging
andscape in investigating strongly correlated systems.
Frustrated magnetic systems host noncollinear or
noncoplanar spin textures which can lead to nove
henomena, including, for example, skyrmion
excitations or anomalous Hall effects.~7 Spin

superconductivity where Cooper pairs are characterized

frustrated magnetic textures, opening new avenues to
studying the interplay between frustrated spin textures
and unconventional superconductivity.!!-“

Recently, several systems hosting frustrated
spin textures have been shown to demonstrate
unconventional superconductivity. For example,

spin triplet superconductivity has been shown to arise
in proximitized kagome Weyl semimetal Mn3Ge,'> '®
a system hosting 120° ordered chiral antiferromagnetic
spin configuration with an anomalous Hall effect in its
normal state. The helical spin texture resulting from
coupling to local frustrated spins can lead to spin-
valley locking, promoting spin triplet superconducting
pairing correlations. In proximity to superconducting
Nb, the system shows long range coherent Josephson
supercurrents,!?° and under an out-of-plane magnetic
field, the system produces hysteretic Josephson
supercurrents, attributed to the finite spin chirality
of the underlying noncoplanar spin texture.?!

Additionally, there has been suggested interplay
between frustrated spin textures and unconventional
superconductivity in alternate stacking transition-metal

and noncentrosymmetric superconducting 1H-TaS2.
The material exhibits chiral superconducting states,
spontaneous vortices, and the “magnetic memory” effect
in addition to spin triplet pairing.??-?4 Recent work
proposes that frustrated magnetic textures underlie the
observed phenomena.?° 2° However, the role of frustrated
spin textures and how they can couple or interact with
unconventional pairing order remains an open avenue to
explore.

It has recently been proposed that frustrated spin
textures can give rise to anisotropic Josephson couplings
avoring spatially inhomogeneous spin triplet pairing
order.!? In this work, we expand upon this theoretical
approach, considering a momentum-dependent d-vector
and incorporating the effects of spin-orbit coupling and
a frustrated local exchange field. In Sec. II, we propose
che free energy for a spatially varying spin triplet pairing
order and demonstrate how it microscopically originates
from the Josephson coupling. The anisotropic Josephson
coupling terms cannot emerge from spin-orbit coupling
but rather arise when itinerant electrons are coupled to
frustrated local spin moments. To illustrate, we analyze
a three-sublattice system on geometrically frustrated
lattices in Sec. II, in which s-d exchange gives rise
o an effective tunneling dependent on the underlying
spin structure. In Sec. IV, we analyze the spin triplet
pairing correlations for an isolated superconducting grain
arising from s-d exchange or spin-orbit coupling. Next,
accounting for the effective tunneling in the presence of
a frustrated local exchange field, we derive the effective
Josephson couplings for the three-sublattice system in
Sec. V. The emergence of anisotropic Josephson coupling
leads to a “pliability” of the pairing order that competes
with the superfluid stiffness and can promote a spatially
varying spin triplet pairing order. Lastly, in Sec. VI,
we demonstrate that when the underlying spin structure
has finite spin chirality, or when there is antisymmetric
Josephson coupling between noncollinear d-vectors, the
system exhibits a Josephson diode effect.

II. FREE ENERGY CONTRIBUTION FROM
SPATIALLY VARYING PAIRING ORDER

Generally, a system will adjust the superconducting
pairing order to minimize the total free energy, which
can be decomposed into two principal contributions,

F = Fhomogeneous + Fvariation- (1)

The first term describes the bulk pairing order for a
single isolated homogeneous superconducting grain and
is associated with the pairing condensation energy, while
the latter term describes the contribution from a spatially
varying pairing order, which can either promote or
penalize spatial inhomogeneity. In this work, we focus
on the contribution to the free energy from a spatially
varying pairing order for a spin triplet superconductor,
deriving anisotropic Josephson couplings which can favor
a spatially inhomogeneous spin triplet pairing order. We
consider sufficiently large superconducting grains, or an
emergent networks of Josephson junctions in a single-
crystal,°°3! in which the Coulumb charging energy is
negligible.
We first review the kinetic energy contribution to
he free energy, which, in the discrete limit, can
e related to the Josephson coupling. Consider a
superconductor with a spatially varying pairing order.
For a conventional s-wave superconductor with complex
scalar pairing order parameter w(r), the energy cost
from a spatially varying order in the absence of an
external field is given by Fyariation = fdr WVer)/?,
with y related to the superfluid stiffness. In
he discrete limit, the gradient term corresponds
o the Josephson coupling between superconducting
grains,“49?°8 Frariation = Lo (nm) InmPnYm + ¢.c. Here,
neighboring superconducting grains n and m described
y pairing order parameters w, and ~w , interact via
Josephson coupling at their interface, with the amplitude
of the Josephson coupling given by Jnm, as shown
in Fig. 1. Physically, this coarse-grained picture
corresponds to weakly-coupled superconducting grains,
where, within each superconducting grain, on the order
of the coherence length of the Cooper pair, the local
pairing order can be treated as uniform. In the absence
of external fields or disorder, the lattice version of the
superfluid stiffness Jnm is typically negative valued. As
such, the free energy is minimized when 7, and wm, have
the same U(1) phase, leading to a phase-coherent and
spatially homogeneous pairing order for sufficiently large
grains.

A. Free energy contribution for spin triplet pairing
order

We now consider spin triplet superconductors, in
which, in addition to a U(1) phase, the orbital angular
momentum and spin of the Cooper pair are also degrees
of freedom that contribute to the free energy. For

system consisting of multiple weakly-linked superconducting

defined locally for the nth superconducting grain is given by
wn. The discretized superfluid stiffness Jnm describes the
Josephson coupling between grains n and m.

superconducting grain n, the pairing order is described
by its overall phase ¢, and d-vector d,,(k).°°37 In
general, the d-vector can be momentum-dependent, with
k describing the relative momentum of the Cooper pair.
The first order Josephson coupling between grains n
and m includes all allowed quadratic couplings of the
d-vectors and takes the following form,

Fam (I,K) = ef") { Jnm(K, W’)dn (Ie) + a(R’)
+ Dam(k,k’) - (dy (x) x di, (k’))

a,b=1,2,3

Above, d,,(k) and ¢, are the d-vector and overall U(1)
phase of the pairing order of the nth grain. The
three terms in the above free energy can be understood
in analogy to super exchange®*“? in classical spin
systems as follows. The first term Jnm corresponds
to a Heisenberg-like symmetric coupling which favors
collinear alignment of d-vectors, whereas the second term
Dim (k,k’) is an antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
(DM)-like coupling that favors noncollinear textures.
The third term TP, (k,k’) is a symmetric traceless
matrix corresponding to “T-type” exchange.*?

Minimization of the free energy in Eq. (2) with
respect to the three types of Josephson couplings can
lead to a spatially inhomogeneous d-vector texture.
The total contribution to the free energy Fyariation =
Vick’ Le(nmy Fnm(k,k’) is given by summing over the
relative momenta k and k’ of all neighboring grains n
and m, respectively. In the continuum limit, the free
energy is given by Fyariation = f d?r fiatistion (r), in which

Above, we have absorbed the U(1) phase into the
definition of the d-vector and integrated out the k-

and KeP(r) are the continuum analogues of Jam, Dnm,
and Dian, respectively. Jnm(k,k’) favors collinear d-

vector textures, and when it is negative-valued, it
can stabilize phase-coherent and spatially homogeneous
d-vector textures. However, the presence of finite
Dnm(k, k’) and Pnm(k, k’) can favor spatially frustrated
d-vector textures, leading to, for example, the formation
of vortices even in the absence of external fields.!° This
leads to an effective “pliability” of the pairing order
that competes with the discrete superfluid stiffness Jnm
and homogeneous contribution Fhomogeneous, Such that
the system tends towards spatially nonuniform d-vector
textures.

B. Microscopic derivation of Josephson couplings

The Josephson free energy in Eq. (2) can be derived
from the Ambegaokar-Baratoff formalism of the first
order Josephson coupling. Consider two superconducting

grains connected by a weak link. Restricting to the
orbital and spin degrees of freedom, the effective single-
particle tunneling across the barrier between grains n and
m is given by** 46

in which Cy. is the annihilation operator for an electron
in grain n with momentum k and spin a = t,|. The
effective tunneling matrix element between grains n and
m generally takes the form Tm (k, k’) = Trm;o(k, k’)o°+
Tam(k,k’) - 0, in which o = (0%,0%,07)" are the
Pauli matrices. Tunneling amplitudes Tym;o(k,k’) and
Tnm(k,k’) correspond to spin-independent and spin-
dependent tunneling processes at the grain boundary,
respectively. The latter can arise from, for example,
spin-orbit coupling or time-reversal breaking fields at the
interface between superconducting grains.

The contribution to the Josephson free energy between
neighboring grains n and m is

Above, the trace is taken over internal degrees of
freedom of the Cooper pair (e.g. spin, sublattice, etc.),
and the summation is taken over fermionic Matsubara
frequencies iw, = (2n + 1)r/ for integers n. Here,
(Finlap (Kes iw) = — f dre” (TeCm,k,a(T)Cm,ka(0)) is
the anomalous Green’s function of grain m that describes
the pairing correlations. The anomalous Green’s function
can be decomposed into its spin singlet and spin triplet
parts as

Fr(k; in) = (Fn.o(s itn) + fn (k; iwn) - 2) io", (7)

with f,,(k;iw,) playing the role of a d-vector describing
spin triplet correlations. Substituting into Eq. (6)
yields three distinct contributions corresponding to the
Josephson tunneling between spin singlet components,
between spin triplet components, and between mixed
spin singlet and spin triplet components, given in
Appendix A.

Here, we focus on the Josephson form factor describing
the couplings between spin triplet pairing orders of grains

given by

Above, the Heisenberg-like Josephson coupling 7,7,
can be realized for purely spin-independent tunneling;
however, the DM-like and I[-type interactions are
respectively linear and quadratic in spin-dependent
unneling amplitude. To realize the DM-like
antisymmetric term JP, it is necessary and sufficient
for the effective tunneling to satisfy

Trmjo(k, kK!) Pum(—k, —k’) #

(10)
Hence, it is sufficient for the spin-independent and
spin-dependent tunneling Thmo(k,k’) and Tym(k,k’)
o be even functions of k and k’ for the DM-
ike Josephson coupling to be nonvanishing. The
antisymmetric Josephson coupling cannot arise, for
example, through spin-orbit coupling alone, under which
Tam(k,k’) = —Trm(—k, —k’) for real-valued Tym (k, k’)
due to time reversal symmetry. For example, for Rashba-
type spin-orbit coupling at the barrier, T,,,,(k,k’) =
[Tove Orne (. & k), with n the vector normal to the
interface,#*-°° the DM-like Josephson is vanishing.
Rather, the tunneling requires, for example, the presence
of a local exchange field or impurities at the interface
that break time reversal symmetry.

1. System with decoupled spin and orbital degrees of
freedom

We first consider the case where spin and orbital
degrees of freedom are decoupled, such as in a generalized
°He-A type pairing. Suppose the pairing correlator takes
the form

in which din is momentum-independent, and gm(k)

of the form Thm(k,k’) = Trmh(k,k’), with the
dimensionless function h(k,k’) describing the
momentum-dependence, with h(k,k) = h(—k,—k).

Up to a factor from the overlap integral of g,(k) and
gm(k), the weighting factor scales approximately as
Wnam ~ —Ao/W?, in which W is the bandwidth, as shown
in Appendix B.

2. System with coupled spin and orbital degrees of freedom

We next consider the case in which the spin and orbital
degrees are coupled in the pairing order. For simplicity,
suppose that the anomalous Green’s function for the mth
grain takes the form

din (k) is a momentum-dependent d-vector satisfying

on

din(k) = —dn(—k).

For a two-dimensional system, the Heisenberg-like,
DM-like, and T-type couplings contributing to the
Josephson form factor can respectively be expressed as

For example, when h(k,k’) is maximally weighted when
k = k’, though d(k) is an odd function of k, the integrals
in Eq. (17) can be nonvanishing.

Ill. MICROSCOPIC MODELS AND EFFECTIVE
TUNNELING IN PRESENCE OF FRUSTRATED
SPIN TEXTURES

From the microscopic model of the Josephson coupling,
two essential ingredients emerge for realizing the general
Josephson free energy in Eq. (8): spin-dependent
Josephson tunneling processes satisfying Eq. (10) and
nonvanishing triplet pairing correlations. These two
conditions are naturally realized in, for example, a system
with itinerant electrons coupled to a frustrated local
exchange field. In this section, we focus on the first
condition and demonstrate that the s-d exchange can
give rise to an effective spin-dependent tunneling that
is sensitive to the frustration of the underlying local spin
moments. Later, in Sec. IV, we demonstrate the spin
triplet pairing correlations.

A. Three-sublattice s-d model on geometrically
frustrated lattice

We consider a minimal s-d model on a geometrically
frustrated system, such as a three-sublattice model on
a kagome or triangular lattice. The system consists of
itinerant s electrons coupled to frustrated localized spins,
which act as a local exchange field. The Hamiltonian for

mean-field level, is given by?! 5?

Aga = Isa S Cree [Paar * Sj]Cr; a's (22)

with J,q being the amplitude of the s-d coupling. The
local exchange field is described by the spin moment
a3 = (dh, a Pa,a/dr;,')/2, with ha being the creation
operator for d electrons. In this work, we treat the local
spins as static classical fields.

The three magnetic sublattices are labelled a, b, and
c, as shown in Fig. 3. The local spin moment at site
j is given by sj; = Sa, Sp, Or Sc, depending on the
corresponding magnetic sublattice, and the geometrically
frustrated lattice leads to a noncollinear spin texture. We
consider the three spins comprising the three-sublattice
system being in a 120° ordered state with out-of-plane
canting,

Sq = (cos Og Cos Yo, COS Mg Sin Yo, Sin My),

Sp = (cos 9 cos(vo + ve), cos 8p sin(yo + vy) sin 00),

three-sublattice systems for the (a) kagome and (b) triangular

the boundaries of superconducting grains n and m consist
of nearest neighbor hopping and effective tunneling from the

tunneling processes mediated by third spin s,.

Here, yo is a constant, 0) describes the out-of-plane
canting, and v = +1 is the sign of the vector chirality for
the local spins. In the ground state, the spins form a 120°
antiferromagnetic order (89 = 0). When the local spins
form a noncoplanar configuration (89 # 0), the scalar
spin chirality, sq - (sy x S<), is finite.

1. Kagome lattice

Consider the system on the kagome lattice, shown
schematically in Fig. 3(a). Nearest neighbor vectors are
£(1,0)7, d2 = £(4,¥8)7, and 63 =
62 — 61, and primitive lattice vectors are a; = a(1,0)7

given by 6; =

lattice vectors satisfying aj -b; = 276;; are given by
b, = 08, —4)7 and by = 1(0,1)7, with b = 4n/v3a.
In the (Cak, Cd,k, Cok)? basis, the Hamiltonian describing

spin-independent nearest neighbor hopping is

in which a; = k- 6;, with i = 1,2,3. Here, chi =

(Ck,it;Ck,i,,) 18 the annihilation operator for electron
spinor with momentum k and sublattice index i = a, b,c.
For only nearest neighbor hopping, the system features
two dispersive bands and a flat band from the destructive
interference, characteristic of the kagome geometry. The
s-d exchange is local and diagonal in sublattice space,

Sa:o 0 0
Hea = Jea 0 sy-o 0 . (25)
0 0 s.:o

The system breaks time reversal symmetry, yet respects
inversion symmetry with respect to the hexagon center
or a lattice site.

Fermi surfaces for the s-d model on the kagome lattice
are shown in Fig. 4(a). For coplanar spin configuration,
the spins of the itinerant electrons are in-plane. For the
given system parameters, there are two Fermi surfaces
centered about the kK points, each displaying a helical
spin texture from the s-d coupling. The winding numbers
of Fermi surfaces about the K points are +1 and —1. The
system can be viewed as displaying spin-valley locking
arising from s-d exchange.'+

2. Triangular lattice

Next, we consider the system on a triangular lattice, as
shown in Fig. 3(b). Nearest neighbor vectors are given by
1 wg (1,0)", 62 aad 3 V3)T , and 63 = 62—6,. Due
to the three-sublattice magnetic ordering, the wa el is

in which A(k) = (e~**' 4 4 et 42 4 e~** 4s). Lastly, the s-

d term is the same as that in Eq. (25), which is diagonal
in sublattice space. The system breaks both inversion
and time reversal symmetries.

Furthermore, we also account for Ising-type spin-

in which Ago is the strength of the spin-orbit coupling.
Ising spin-orbit coupling has been shown to lead to spin-
valley polarization in transition metal dichalcogenides.
We show the Fermi surface for the s-d model with Ising
in-orbit coupling in Fig. 4(b). With s-d exchange,
sing spin-orbit coupling, or a combination of the two,
here are spin-polarized Fermi surfaces, with the spin of
inerant electrons polarized in the z-direction. Even for
oplanar spin configuration, the s-d exchange can lead to
pins of the itinerant electrons polarized out-of-plane due
o the geometric frustration, in contrast to the system
nm the kagome lattice, in which the spins lie in-plane.
Consequently, the s-d coupling can enhance the spin-
valley locking in an Ising superconductor, depending on
the sign of the vector chirality of the underlying spin
configuration.

B. Effective tunneling in presence of s-d exchange

We next derive the effective tunneling of itinerant
electrons in the presence of a local exchange field
comprised of frustrated spin moments. Consider the
Hamiltonian H = Ho + H. Here, Ho denotes the
Hamiltonian of the unperturbed system and_ refers
to nearest neighbor hopping Hxin, and © is the
perturbation, corresponding to s-d exchange Hsq in the
context of this work. The corresponding Green’s function

7

is given by G(iw) = (iw—H)~1. Let Go(iw) = (iw—Ho)7!
be the Green’s function of the unperturbed Hamiltonian.
From Dyson’s equation, it follows that G(iw) = (iw—Ho—
d)7! = Go(iw) + Go(iw)EG(iw), or equivalently,°?°°

G (iw) = Go (iw) + Go (iw) 5(iw) Go (iw), (28)
with 3 serving as the T-matrix, defined recursively as
¥(iw) = D + Go (iw) E(iw). (29)

In this work, we treat s-d exchange Hsq perturbatively
and retain terms up to third order in Jgq to capture
any nonvanishing spin chirality of the three-sublattice
magnetic ordering. From the above expansion, the
effective s-d exchange is given by

Der (iw) © Hsa + HsaGuin(iw)Hsa
+ HsaGrin (iw) H sd Guin (tw) Hsa- (30)

Above, Gxin(iw) = (iw — Hxin)~! is the free Green’s
function in the absence of s-d exchange, which includes
only spin-independent nearest neighbor hopping.

Now, we consider the off-diagonal matrix elements
describing the effective tunneling processes between
nearest neighboring sites. Considering the spin-
independent nearest neighbor hopping and the T-
matrix expansion of the s-d exchange in Eq. (30), the
effective tunneling in the spin-1/2 basis between nearest
neighboring sites 7 and j is given by

Tyy (iw) = (i|(Ho + Serr) i)

= 190" + Pea( (8-2) Grin( i) (85 -@))

+335 > (si +) (Guin(iw)]i,g (Sk 7) [Grin (iw) ] 5 (85° @)).
‘ (31)

Above, s; is the local spin moment at site i, and
the summation is taken over sites k which are nearest
neighbors to both sites i and j. In Figs. 3(a) and (b), we
show schematically the effective tunneling in the presence
of the local spin moments for the kagome and triangular
lattices, respectively.

Using the fact that Gii,(iw) is spin-independent and
that the s-d exchange is on-site, the effective tunneling
matrix reduces to

Above, we have defined the factors
Bi; = 8; X 83;
— (85° 8;)Sx + (Sj ° Sk)Si,

which are dependent on the underlying local exchange
field. For the three-sublattice system, spins s;, s;, and
s, correspond to the three spins s,, s,, and s,. The
first term, a,j, is even under time reversal symmetry
and under inversion with respect to the center of the
ond between sites i and j, and it is maximized for
a collinear spin configuration. ;; is likewise even
under time reversal symmetry, but it is odd under the
inversion above and maximized for noncollinear spin
configurations. The scalar spin chirality jj, breaks
oth inversion and time reversal symmetries. Lastly, the
higher order term 7;;;, breaks time reversal symmetry
ut preserves inversion symmetry. The three terms ;;,
Yijr: and Xij~ Can be nonvanishing for noncollinear spin
extures.

In principle, finite scalar spin chirality can also induce
an emergent gauge field via Peierls substitution, which
would enter into the free Green’s function Gyn. °°? This
mechanism has been shown, for example, to generate
an anomalous Hall effect! in addition to stabilizing
superconductivity when pairing occurs between bands
with opposite gauge charges.®* In this work, we neglect
the Peierls phase as we are primarily interested in
the spin-dependent tunneling factors arising in the
presence of a local exchange field. Moreover, the
formalism in this work, namely the anisotropic Josephson
couplings in Eq. (2), can persist in coplanar spin
configurations without scalar spin chirality. Lastly, we
discuss the effective tunneling in the limit of strong Jsq
in Appendix C.

IV. SPIN TRIPLET PAIRING CORRELATIONS
ARISING FROM s-d EXCHANGE OR
SPIN-ORBIT COUPLING

We now discuss the spin triplet correlations in the
three-sublattice systems. We consider two representative
cases: the case of only s-d exchange without spin-orbit
coupling, and the case of spin-orbit coupling. In general,
spin-orbit coupling can give rise to an admixture of spin
singlet and spin triplet pairing correlations due to broken
inversion symmetry,°* °° and here, we focus on the role
of Ising spin orbit coupling as a representative example.
The following analysis of the bulk pairing order neglects
the effects of Josephson coupling, which are discussed in
Sec. V.

The BdG Hamiltonian kernel in the Nambu basis
(Gigs ci)? takes the form

in which cy = (€a,k,Cb,k,€c,k). Above, H(k) is the

kernel of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (20), and A(k) is
the pairing gap function, which can be either intrinsic
or proximitized. The anomalous Green’s function,
Fig p(kiiw) = —f dre (Tpc-1j,8(7)Aci,a(0)),

encodes the superconducting pairing correlations and

corresponds to the off-diagonal component of the BdG
Green’s function Ggac(k;iw) = (iw — Hpac(k))~1.59:6"
The anomalous Green’s function is given by

F(k; iw) = —G(k; iw) A(k) D(k; iw)GT (—k; iw), (35)

in which G(k;iw) = (iw — H(k))~! is the normal
single-particle Green’s function, including s-d exchange
and spin-orbit coupling, and D(k;iw) = [1 +
G™ (—k; —iw) At (k)G(k; iw)A(k)|-!. In the following,
we consider the case of momentum-independent,
intrasublattice proximitized s-wave pairing, A(k) =
Aol3x3 ® (io¥), with Ao being the pairing amplitude.

A. Pairing correlations in s-d model

We first analyze pairing correlations arising solely from
spin-independent hopping and s-d exchange. Coupling
to the exchange field formed by local spin moments
naturally generates spin triplet components in the pairing
correlations. To demonstrate this effect, we expand
perturbatively in the s-d coupling Jsq. The single-
particle Green’s function can be expressed via a Dyson
series as

G(k; iw) = Qrin(ks iw) S>[HsaPin (ki iw)]”, (36)

n>0

with Giin(k; iw) = (iw—Hxin(k))~+ being the free Green’s
function in the absence of the s-d exchange. In the
linearized gap regime, with Ag < Jgq and Ap < to,
the anomalous Green’s function can be systematically
expanded in orders of Jsaq as F(k;iw) = > y O(JN), in
which the Nth order contribution is given by

N
O(TSi) = Ao SOD Grin (I; iw) [#saGxin(k iw)]
n=0

N-n
x Giin(—k; —iw) [Peau Gitin(—K; —iw)| (13x3 @ io”).
(37)

Above,  Gxin(k;iw) has off-diagonal components
corresponding to intersublattice hopping while Hsq
introduces spin-sublattice coupling via the local
exchange field. For noncollinear spin texture, this
leads to emergence of mixed-parity superconducting
correlations in both spin singlet and spin triplet channels.

To demonstrate explicitly, we decompose the
anomalous Green’s function between sublattices i

Fi; (k; iw) = [ fos ( iw) + £;; (Ik; iw) - o| (io”), (38)

in which fo,;; and f,; denote the singlet and triplet pairing
correlations respectively. The vector fj; plays the role
of the d-vector, corresponding to induced spin triplet
correlations, and its direction and magnitude depend
on the underlying spin texture, lattice geometry, and
relative strength of s-d coupling.

For the system on the kagome lattice, the noncollinear
spin texture discussed in Sec. III breaks time reversal
but preserves inversion symmetry with respect to the
hexagon center. As illustrated in Fig. 4(a), the spins of
the itinerant electrons at the Fermi surface are polarized
in-plane with helical spin textures. Due to the inversion
symmetry, the spin of electrons at k and —k participating
in the zero center-of-mass momentum pairing have the
same spin. Consequently, in the weak coupling regime,
pairing correlations for states at the Fermi surface can
be present, but are generally weak and do not open a
gap, as shown in Fig. 5(a) and discussed in Appendix D.
To realize stronger pairing correlations for states at
the Fermi surface, one can consider a different pairing
interaction channel or introduce additional symmetry-
breaking terms. For example, near the interface with
an s-wave superconductor, inversion symmetry breaking
at the junction interface can lead to spin triplet pairing
correlations.‘

In contrast, for the system on the triangular lattice,
s-d exchange breaks both time reversal and inversion
symmetries for noncollinear spin textures, allowing for
an admixture of spin singlet and triplet superconducting
pairing correlations for states at the Fermi level. As
shown in Fig. 4(b), the s-d coupling results in spin-
valley polarization, with the spins of itinerant electrons
with momentum k and —k being antiparallel, which
is compatible with the s-wave pairing gap function.
This results in a mixture of spin singlet pairing and
spin triplet equal-spin pairing correlations, analogous to
an Ising superconductor.°® The pairing correlations are
confirmed in Fig. 5(b), where both spin singlet and spin
triplet pairing correlations for states at the Fermi surface
are of similar order of magnitude. While the relative
magnitude and direction of fj;(k) is largely dependent
on the system parameters, including the underlying
local exchange field and relative strength of Jsa, the
general features—namely the coexistence of spin singlet
and spin triplet superconducting pair correlations—are
robust over a wide range of parameters.

B. Pairing correlations in an Ising superconductor

In systems with strong Ising spin-orbit coupling,
pairing correlations in the isolated bulk superconductor
can primarily be driven by the spin-orbit coupling, as
in the case of an Ising superconductor.*® While the
magnitude of the s-d exchange and the Ising spin-orbit
coupling can be on the same energy scale, we focus
exclusively on the role of the Ising spin-orbit coupling in
the following for simplicity. The addition of s-d exchange
can further enhance the spin-valley locking, as described
in Sec. HIA 2.

We consider the band Hamiltonian Hpana(k)
accounting for the nearest neighbor hopping and

0 i |max(|F iw)

FIG. 5. BdG excitation spectra and spin triplet pairing
correlations for systems on the (a) kagome lattice and
(b) triangular lattice. The spectrum is colored on a continuum
according to the magnitude of the total spin triplet pairing
correlations, including inter- and intrasublattice pairing.
Parameters for the system are the same as those in Fig. 4, and
the magnitude of the pairing gap function is Ap = 0.05|to|.

Ising spin-orbit coupling. The band Hamiltonian for the
riangular lattice is given by

Hbana(k) = Hxin(k) + Hso(k) (39)

in which Hin in Eq. (26) describes the hopping and
on-site chemical energy, and Hgo in Eq. (27) describes
the Ising spin-orbit coupling. Following Ref. 58, which
studies Ising superconductivity for a two-band model, we
consider proximitizing the three-sublattice system with
s-wave superconductivity, with the pairing gap function
taking the form A(k) = Ap13x3 @ io”.

Because the band Hamiltonian in Eq. (39) is diagonal
in spin-space, the Green’s function Gpana(k;iw) = (tw —
Hpana(k))~+ can be decomposed as

Goana(k; iw) = g(k; iw) @ 0° + g.(k;iw) @ 07. (40)

Here, g(k;iw) and gz(k;iw) are 3 x 3 matrices in
sublattice space. In the linearized gap regime,
the anomalous Green’s function takes the form
F(k;iw) © —Gpana(k; iw)A(k)Gi,q(—k; -iw) and can
be decomposed into spin singlet and spin triplet
components, F(k;iw) = (fo(k; iw) + f£(k; iw) - )(io¥),
in which

fo © Ao[g0(k; iw) go(—k; —iw) — gz(k; iw)g2(—k; —iw)]
f = Ao[9o(—k; —iw)9.(k; iw) — go(k; tw)g.(—k; ae
Here, f = f(k;iw) and fo = fo(k;iw) detail the
intrasublattice and intersublattice pairing correlations,
satisfying [fo(k iw)]ij = [fo(—: iw] and [E(k t))iy =
—[f(—k; iw)],;, with i and j being the sublattice indices.
It follows that the spin triplet pairing components arise
from the Ising spin-orbit coupling, with the d-vector
polarized along the z direction, corresponding to equal-
spin pairing.

V. EFFECTIVE JOSEPHSON COUPLING IN
THE PRESENCE OF FRUSTRATED SPIN
TEXTURES

In Sec. IH, we demonstrated that coupling to a local
exchange field can give rise to an effective spin-dependent
unneling of itinerant electrons, and in Sec. IV, we
showed that either s-d exchange or spin-orbit coupling
can induce spin triplet pairing correlations for the
hree-sublattice system. In the following, we consider
a system composed of many superconducting grains
and demonstrate that the effective tunneling from s-d
exchange can generate anisotropic Josephson couplings
etween the spin triplet pairing correlations. These
couplings, in turn, can stabilize spatially varying d-vector
extures.

Consider the Josephson coupling between two adjacent
superconducting grains n and m, for which the spin
riplet pairing correlations are described by d-vectors
d,,(k) and d,,(k), as shown in Fig. 6. We assume
hat states at the grain boundary primarily contribute
o the Josephson tunneling. As such, the tunneling
rocess will depend on the local spin configuration
at the interface between two superconducting grains,
with the total Josephson coupling obtained by summing
over all microscopic tunneling processes along the grain
oundary. For simplicity, we consider tunneling of the
orm Thm (k,k’) = Tnmdk,k’. From the nearest neighbor
effective tunneling in Eq. (32), the spin-independent and
spin-dependent tunneling of itinerant electrons across the
grain boundary are given by Thm:o = icky JX Tij;0
and Thm ied, jem T,;. Here, summation of
nearest neighboring sites i and j is taken over the grain
boundaries ©, and ¥,,, of grains n and m respectively,
and Tj; is the effective tunneling in Eq. (32), which arises
from s-d exchange at the interface.

As an illustrative example, we examine the model on
a triangular lattice, shown schematically in Fig. 3(b).
For the three-sublattice system, nearest neighbors
correspond to sublattices with spins s; and s,;, and the
summation in the third order terms corresponds to the
third sublattice, which we label as s,. The effective
spin-independent and spin-dependent tunneling between

For simplicity, let us consider a d-vector which is valley-
polarized in momentum space, corresponding to the case
in Sec. IIB1. As an example, we take gm(k) in Eq. (11)
to have f-wave symmetry, as depicted in Fig. 6. From the
form of the tunneling in Eq. (42), the effective Josephson
couplings between d-vectors d, and d,, in Eq. (13) are

up to an overall factor. Above, we approximate the
weighting function as Wmn ~ —Ao/W?, in which Ag is
the magnitude of the pairing gap function and W is the
bandwidth.

In the limit of vanishing coupling to the exchange
field, the Heisenberg-like J,,,, term dominates, promoting
collinear d-vectors at adjacent superconducting grains.
For Jnm <0, minimization of the free energy leads to a
homogeneous order parameter, with any spatial variation
of the d-vector being penalized. For finite J,q, it follows
that DM-like coupling Dnm can play a significant role
and compete with Jnm. This competition promotes
noncollinear configurations of d-vectors at adjacent
grains and can stabilize spatially inhomogeneous d-
vector textures, such as skyrmion-like configurations.
The T-type coupling represents a higher order tunneling
process and can further reinforce noncollinear d-vector
configurations.
For frustrated magnetic textures, the dominant
contributions stem from the Heisenberg-like and DM-
like Josephson coupling, leading to noncollinear d-vectors
at adjacent superconducting grains. The relative angle
between d-vectors is given by

6 = arctan(D1/Jnm); (44)

in which Dp = Dnm - (dn x d*,)/|dn x d%,| is the

component of Dy, normal to the plane spanned by

d, and d*,. In Fig. 6, we show the nonuniform d-
vector texture in a hybrid picture of momentum space
describing the d-vectors for the superconducting grains,
and the real-space Josephson coupling. Finite DM-
ike Josephson coupling favors a spatially inhomogeneous
airing order, which can lead to nontrivial contributions
o the superfluid velocity.!°

Both the relative strength of the s-d exchange and
the noncollinearity of the underlying spin texture can
determine the characteristic length scale of the d-vector
textures. Namely, the ratio of DM-like to Heisenberg-
ike Josephson couplings is given by Dym/Jnm
View,,jeu,, JsaGijz, to leading order in Ja. In, for
example, 4Hb-TaS2, the s-d exchange has been shown
o be on the order of 10 meV.°* Below, we analyze three
representative cases illustrating how different underlying
spin configurations affect the Josephson coupling in the
imit of Jsa < W. When the s-d coupling is comparable
o the bandwidth (Jsa 2 to), the perturbative expansion
of the tunneling in Eq. (32) is not valid; rather, it
is necessary to employ a new form of the Josephson
couplings in Eq. (13), as discussed in Appendix C.
Collinear spin configuration — We first consider a
system in which the local spins are in a ferromagnetic
or collinear antiferromagnetic configuration. In this

case, the magnitude of ajj = s;-s; is maximized,
while the measure of noncollinearity B;; = s; x 8;
and spin chirality yij, = si - (sj x Se) vanish. The

nigher order term, jj, is finite for collinear spin
configuration, but contributes weakly to the Josephson
free energy. The vector D,,, does not vary in space and
is uniformly aligned in the local direction of the Néel
vector. However, because the DM-like term originates
from a higher order tunneling process, its effect is weak.
Consequently, for collinear spin configurations with weak
s-d exchange, the Heisenberg-like Josephson coupling
Jnm GAominates, promoting a collinear d-vector texture.
Depending on the sign of Jnm, this will either favor
a homogeneous superconducting order (Jnm < 0) or a
spatially modulating U(1) phase (Jnm > 0).

Coplanar spin configuration — Next, we turn to the
classical 120° coplanar ordering of the three-sublattice
antiferromagnet. Here, the scalar spin chirality vanishes,

Xijk = 0, whereas aj; and {;; are both finite. To lowest
order in Jsa, the nonvanishing terms in Josephson free
energy in Eq. (43) are given by

where ajj = cos2m/3 = —1/2 and B;; = (V3/2) e452

for the 120° ordered spin configuration, with ¢;,; being
the antisymmetric tensor. The discrete superfluid
stiffness J, competes with the DM-like Josephson
coupling Dym, favoring noncollinear d-vectors at
adjacent grains and leading to a spatially inhomogeneous
superconducting pairing order. For example, when
Jsa/to ~ 1/10, it follows that the relative magnitudes
of Josephson couplings are of order |Dym|/JInm ~
(Jsa/t2) ~ 107%. Consequently, the relative angle
between d-vectors at adjacent grains is of order 6 ~ 1077.
The characteristic length of the d-vector textures is \ =
(27/0)E, in which € is the size of the superconducting
grain. The superconducting grain size is generally set by
the superconducting coherence length, which is on the
order of tens of nanometers.!9:?? The resulting d-vector
texture has a characteristic length scale on the order of
tens of microns. Hence, even in the absence of scalar spin
chirality, noncollinear spin configurations can promote
frustrated d-vector textures.
Noncoplanar spin configuration — Lastly, we consider
the case where the three 120° ordered spins in the ground
state are canted out-of-plane by angle 6) in Eq. (23).
Finite 0 leads to nonvanishing scalar spin chirality,

3V3
Lape = WS cos? @ sin 49, (46)
which is dependent on the sign of the canting angle and
the vector spin chirality, v. The corresponding spin-
dependent factor 3. jj acquires an in-plane component and
is dependent on the intersublattice tunneling at the grain
boundary, with

As a result, Dym in Eq. (43) changes sign and direction
in real-space and is sensitive to the geometry of the
superconducting grains. Nonetheless, minimization of
the Josephson free energy requires the d-vector to develop
a spatially inhomogeneous texture, with characteristic
length scale on the order of tens of microns, similar to
when there is a coplanar spin configuration.

VI. JOSEPHSON DIODE EFFECT ARISING
FROM FRUSTRATED SPIN TEXTURES

Lastly, we demonstrate that the presence of finite
spin chirality in the underlying local exchange field
or antisymmetric coupling of noncollinear d-vectors
can lead to a Josephson diode effect. Consider
a superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS)
Josephson junction between superconductors n and m,
as shown schematically in Fig. 7, in which the barrier
region hosts a frustrated spin texture. Considering up
to second order Josephson tunneling, the Josephson
current can be expressed as

1 (g) = Ty sin($ — ¢1) + Ip sin(2¢— do) (48)

in which ¢ = ¢n — dm is the difference in U(1) phases,
J; and Ig are the magnitudes of the first and second
order Josephson currents, respectively, and ¢, and $2
are constant phase shifts. We take the approximation
hat the Josephson current is primarily dominated by the
first order contribution. As such, the Josephson critical
current reaches extrema at ¢4 © 1/24 ¢1, and ¢_ =
3n/2+ ¢, yielding critical current [.4 ~% I — Iz sin(2¢) —
g2) and [.. © —I, — Insin(2¢, — ¢2) respectively. It
follows that the Josephson diode efficiency is given by

Deel Be

Below, we demonstrate that when there is nonvanishing
spin chirality or noncollinear d-vector configuration, this
can lead to a Josephson diode effect.

From the Ambegaokar-Baratoff formalism, the first
order Josephson current between grains n and m is given

12

by 2:#7549:69

I(¢) = _ (JInm — €.€.) , (50)

with Jnm being the Josephson form factor in Eq. (6).
For simplicity, we consider a Josephson junction between
two unitary spin triplet superconductors, with pairing
order of the nth grain described by elfnd,,, in which ¢,
is the U(1) superconducting phase and d,, is the real
dimensionless d-vector.

In addition to the difference in U(1) phases, the
Josephson form factor is given by the relative orientation
of d-vectors, as shown in Eq. (6). The first order
Josephson current can be expressed as

I,(¢) = I sin(¢ — ¢1), (51)

in which I) = (e/A)|Tnml and
—Im(Jnm) /Re(JInm). Here, we define

tan ¢1 =

Tam = InmAn Ain +Dam* (din X din) +4nE nmin, (52)

which is independent of the U(1) phase difference and
encodes the relative alignment of d-vectors. From the
Josephson couplings in Eq. (43), it follows that

Here, we have taken the leading order terms in the s-d
coupling, which comprise the Heisenberg-like and DM-
like Josephson couplings. The imaginary component,
cubic in Jsq and corresponding to second order tunneling
processes, produces a finite phase shift, resulting in a ¢o
junction with I)(¢) 4 —h(-¢).
The second order Josephson effect corresponds to
a term that is fourth order in the single-particle
unneling described by tunneling matrix T),,,. Under the
assumption that the spin-independent nearest-neighbor
unneling tp is most heavily weighted in the tunneling
process, it follows that the second order Josephson
critical current is given by I2(¢) * Iz sin(2¢), in which

For collinear d-vectors in grains n and m, the diode
efficiency scales linearly with the spin chirality in the
barrier region. For noncollinear d-vectors, the diode
efficiency is additionally dependent on the time-reversal
breaking factor y;;, in Eq. (33) and relative orientation
of d-vectors.

The Josephson diode effect arises from the effective
tunneling in the presence of a frustrated local spin
texture locally breaking time reversal and inversion
symmetries, which are both necessary to produce a
finite diode effect.””! Here, the scalar spin chirality
is antisymmetric, with §; - (8; x 8) = —S; - (8; x Sj),
corresponding to local inversion symmetry breaking for
noncoplanar spin configurations. However, unlike the
spin factor B;; in Eq. (33), the spin chirality is a
scalar term and hence enters into the spin-independent
tunneling of electrons, as shown in Eq. (42). As such,
the tunneling of itinerant electrons in the presence
of nonvanishing spin chirality breaks time reversal
symmetry in addition to local inversion symmetry. For
the latter term in Eq. (56), ¥;;, is odd under time-
reversal but invariant under inversion, ix "Vik.
However, it is coupled to d, x Gh which, for noncollinear
d-vector configuration, breaks inversion, d, x din =
—din Ke dy. Hence, the Josephson diode effect can arise
from noncoplanar spin structure in the barrier region, or
from a noncollinear d-vector configuration.

Moreover, when the underlying spin configuration
has nonvanishing spin chirality, this is also applicable
to, for example, junctions between two spin singlet
superconductors. For spin singlet superconductors, there
is only a U(1) degree of freedom, and as such, the scalar
Josephson coupling, in analogy to the Heisenberg-like
coupling Jnm, will persist. For the same symmetry
reasons outlined above, the effective tunneling in the
presence of a frustrated spin texture in the barrier region
will lead to a Josephson diode effect with efficiency
proportional to the scalar spin chirality of the underlying
magnetic texture.

In the nonperturbative regime, when J,q is comparable
to to, the Josephson diode effect persists. Considering
higher order terms in Jsq in the Josephson couplings in
Eq. (43), there will be additional contributions to the
critical current which are dependent on the underlying

texture. Finite spin chirality in the barrier region, xij, 4 0,
leads to direction-dependent critical currents J., and I._,
resulting in a Josephson diode effect.

spin configuration. Consequently, the imaginary and real
parts of the Josephson form factor can be of comparable
magnitude, which can impact both the first and second
order critical currents. While the Josephson diode
efficiency can differ in the nonperturbative regime, the
essential features remain: specifically, terms that break
both time-reversal and inversion symmetry will give rise
to a finite diode effect.

Lastly, we comment on the effects of Majorana edge
states. In systems that admit spin triplet pairing
correlations, the pairing order transforms according to a
nontrivial representation of orbital angular momentum.
For a system with only spin and orbital degrees of
freedom, spin triplet pairing order has odd integer partial
wave symmetry in momentum space. This can lead
to Majorana states, which can contribute, for example,
4x-periodic Josephson current when fermion parity is
conserved at the junction barrier.’?-” In this case, the

Josephson current can be expressed as [ (mm) (g) ~]
Ip sin(¢/2 — 9) +L; sin(¢— $1) + Jp sin(2¢— ¢2) to lowest
order. The magnitude of 47-periodic Josephson current,
Zo, can be obtained, for example, by projecting to the
Majorana states localized at the junction barrier. The
contribution from the 47-periodic Josephson current can
modify the critical currents I. and I, and is sensitive
to the relative magnitude of Jg and [,. Nonetheless, the
discrepancy in I,; and [,_ arises from the admixture of
different order Josephson currents. The salient features
of the Josephson diode effect, which arise in the presence
of broken parity and time reversal symmetry at the
junction interface, persist.

VII. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

We have demonstrated that coupling itinerant
electrons in a spin triplet superconductor to a local
exchange field consisting of frustrated spins can generate
anisotropic Josephson couplings between d-vectors.
These anisotropic Josephson couplings, analogous
to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and I-type interactions in
magnetism, endow a “pliability” to the pairing order that
competes with the superfluid stiffness and can stabilize a
spatially varying d-vector texture.

Such terms correspond microscopically to Josephson
coupling of superconducting grains and can be realized
when itinerant electrons in a spin triplet superconductor
are coupled to a frustrated spin texture. Local spins
in an s-d model on a geometrically frustrated lattice
ead to an effective tunneling of itinerant electrons that
is dependent on the underlying magnetic configuration.
Moreover, spin triplet pairing correlations can arise
either from s-d exchange or spin-orbit coupling. The
presence of a noncollinear frustrated spin texture
or the three-sublattice system leads to anisotropic
DM-like and [-type Josephson couplings, which can
romote spatially varying d-vector textures. Lastly,
a Josephson diode effect can arise when the junction
barrier hosts noncoplanar spins with finite spin chirality,
or when there is antisymmetric Josephson coupling
etween noncollinear d-vectors, breaking both time-
reversal and inversion symmetry at the interface between
superconducting grains.

The results are relevant to recent experiments
suggesting the coexistence of frustrated magnetism and
unconventional superconductivity. For example, in
kagome noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Ge, where
unconventional superconductivity emerges in proximity
o Nb, spins of Mn serve as a local exchange field that
can mediate DM-like and T-type Josephson couplings,
even for coplanar spin configurations. For SIS junctions
consisting of Mn3X (X = Sn, Ge) in the junction barrier
region between two s-wave superconductors, this can
ead to a Josephson diode effect for noncoplanar spin
configurations.
Additionally, the results are pertinent to
superconducting 4Hb-TaS». The frustrated spin
extures in the 1T-TaS2 layers can serve as a local
exchange field for the Ising superconducting 1H-TaS»
ayers. Here, Ising spin-orbit coupling, in addition to the
coupling to frustrated magnetic textures, can generate
spin triplet superconducting pairing correlations. The
competition of Ising spin-orbit coupling and the local
spin textures can lead to spatially varying d-vector
textures in absence of external field.

The results of this work, demonstrating the existence
of anisotropic Josephson couplings arising from interplay
with frustrated spin configurations, open new avenues
to understanding the origin of nontrivial spatial textures
in unconventional superconductors. While the present

work treats the local spins as a static classical exchange
field, the effects of quantum fluctuations and dynamic
spin textures, for example, remain an open question to
be explored. Moreover, other forms of spin-dependent
tunneling between superconducting grains can serve as
a basis for realizing the proposed anisotropic Josephson
couplings.

Appendix A: Josephson form factor and free energy

Focusing on the spin degrees of freedom, the anomalous

Substituting into Eq. (A1), the trace can be expressed as
three distinct contributions,

which correspond to the Josephson tunneling between
spin singlet components, between spin _ triplet

For systems that admit a mixture of spin singlet an

pin triplet correlations from broken parity symmetry,
oth Cying-trip and Cirip—trip can contribute to the d-
vector textures. n the present work, we focus on
ne effective Josephson coupling between spin triple
correlations and thus analyze the last contribution.
Nonetheless, the coupling of spin singlet and spin
riplet correlations, which arise in the presence o:
ffective spin-depedent tunneling of itinerant electrons,
can further promote spatially inhomogeneous spin triple
airing order. Namely, the d-vector can couple to the
spin-dependent tunneling Tym(k,k’), or to the vector
product) Trm(k,k’) x Tnm(—k,—k’). For example,
consider the tunneling in the presence of a frustrated
local exchange field, given in Eq. (42). The coupling
to Thm is sensitive to the tunneling at the junction
interface but nonetheless can further stabilize spatially
inhomogeneous d-vector textures.

Appendix B: Magnitude of Josephson coupling

In this section, we provide an estimate of the
magnitude of the Josephson coupling. Consider the
factor Wnm(8) in Eq. (14), which determines the
weighting of the Josephson couplings. For simplicity,

suppose that the band structure of the normal metal is
the same for grains n and m. Replacing the sum over
momenta k and k’ to an integral over the energy of the
normal states, it follows that

Wnm(B) = I dede’ D(e)D(E") (v(k, "eg, (BL)

in which D(€) is the single-particle density of states, and
at zero-temperature,

_ AG dn lk) gin (k’)h(k, k')h(—k, —k’)
2 EnEm,«’ (En,k + Em’)

u(k, k’)

(B2)

Above, (u(k,k’))¢,¢, denotes the average of v(k,k’) over
the constant-energy surfaces of € and €’ for momenta k
and k’ respectively.

In the weak-coupling regime, states at the Fermi
surface primarily contribute to Josephson tunneling, with
D(é) © D(0) ~ 1/W, in which W is the bandwidth.
Suppose that the BdG quasiparticle energy for grain n is

Enx = V€(k) + |Aogn(k)|?. It follows that

with « = €/Ao and x’ = €'/Ao. Given nonvanishing
overlap of gn (k) and gm(k’), the integral Ij» is of order
unity, and as such, the weighting factor scales as

Wnm ~ —D?(0)Ao ~ — 5. (B5)

Consequently, provided that the tunneling matrices T;;

aah

are comparable to the hopping amplitude, the Josephson
coupling amplitudes in Eq. (13) are on the order of the
pairing amplitude Ao.
Appendix C: Effective tunneling in the limit of
strong s-d exchange

In this section, we describe the effective tunneling in
the presence of s-d exchange in the Jsq >> to limit.

Considering the summation of tunneling processes at
the boundary between two superconducting grains, the
effective tunneling matrices in Eq. (C9) correspond to
the tunneling matrices in Eq. (6).

Notably, a frustrated magnetic texture is not necessary
to achieve the anisotropic Josephson couplings in Eq. (2)
in the limit of strong s-d coupling. For example, for a
collinear ferromagnetic spin configuration, in which local
spins at sites 7 and 7 are given by 8; = 8; = —sgn(Jsa)io,
the effective tunneling reduces to

To! = 2 (00 + fig - o). (C10)
The effective tunneling satisfies the condition in Eq. (10),
which can give rise to a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-like
Josephson coupling. In contrast to the cases discussed
in Sec. V which consider J.q < to, strong s-d exchange
can give rise to comparable amplitudes of the Josephson
couplings Jnm, Drm, and Pym and can further promote
a spatially inhomogeneous d-vector texture. This regime
can be pertinent to systems such as proximitized Mng3Ge,
in which the s-d coupling can be comparable to the
hopping amplitude.°°*!

Appendix D: Interband pairing correlations for s-d
model on kagome lattice

We analyze the superconducting pairing correlations
in the s-d model on the kagome lattice. As discussed
in Sec. IV A, superconducting pairing correlations for
states at the Fermi surface are suppressed due to
inversion symmetry. Namely, eigenstate w¢(k, £) with
momentum k, energy E, and spin o are related
by inversion to state wo(—k,E). This results in
an even-parity spin texture over the Fermi surface,
as shown in Fig. 4(a). Consequently, states at
the Fermi surface are incompatible with proximitized
zero center-of-mass momentum singlet gap function,
Asing(k) = Asing()(ITU)CN| — Ht), and as seen
in Fig. 5(a), do not open a gap. Rather, finite pairing
correlations for states at the Fermi surface can arise
from spin triplet pairing channels, for example, Atrip =
Atsip(k) oe) (oo.

In the presence of proximitized spin singlet gap
function, zero center-of-mass pairing correlations

correspond to interband pairing at higher energies. In
Fig. 8 we plot the spin texture of eigenstates for the
s-d system in Eq. (20) on the kagome lattice along the
I-K symmetry line. States we(k, E) and wo/(—k, —E)
for finite E can have different spins, 6 4 6’, as the
system breaks particle-hole symmetry. As such, higher
energy states admit an admixture of spin singlet and
spin triplet pairing correlations from a proximitized spin
singlet superconducting gap function.
