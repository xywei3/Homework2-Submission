Abstract—Quantum tomography is a fundamental technique
for characterizing, benchmarking, and verifying quantum states
and devices. It plays a crucial role in advancing quantum
technologies and deepening our understanding of quantum me-
chanics. Collective quantum state tomography, which estimates
an unknown state p through joint measurements on multiple
copies p ®---@p of the unknown state, offers superior informa-
tion extraction efficiency. Here we extend this framework to a
generalized setting where the target becomes S| ®---®@S,, with
each 5; representing identical or distinct quantum states, detec-
tors, or processes from the same category. We formulate these
tasks as optimization problems and develop three algorithms
for collective quantum state, detector and process tomography,
respectively, each accompanied by an analytical characterization
of the computational complexity and mean squared error (MSE)
scaling. Furthermore, we develop optimal solutions of these
optimization problems using sum of squares (SOS) techniques
with semi-algebraic constraints. The effectiveness of our proposed
methods is demonstrated through numerical examples. Addition-
ally, we experimentally demonstrate the algorithms using two-
copy collective measurements, where entangled measurements
directly provide information about the state purity. Compared
to existing methods, our algorithms achieve lower MSEs and
approach the collective MSE bound by effectively leveraging
purity information.

I. INTRODUCTION

Quantum system identification [I], [2] and quantum tomog-
raphy [3], are essential for obtaining comprehensive infor-
mation of quantum systems. This endeavor is critical for the
thorough exploration and effective management of quantum
systems [5], [6], [7J. Acquiring complete models facilitates
advancements in various quantum science applications, such
as quantum computing [3], quantum sensing [8], and quantum
control [9}, There are three primary tasks in quantum
tomography: (i) quantum state tomography (QST), which aims
to estimate unknown quantum states [II], (12), (13), (14),
; (ii) quantum detector tomography (QDT), which focuses
on identifying and calibrating quantum measurement devices
[16], [19]; and (iii) quantum process tomography
(QPT), designed to determine the parameters characterizing
unknown quantum processes [20], (21), (22), (231, (24, (25).
State, process, and detector tomography, closely connected
in both mathematical and physical senses, together form an
essential triad necessary to fully characterize typical quantum
measurement experiments

For QST, various algorithms have beem employed, such
as Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Linear
Regression Estimation [1 . For low-rank quantum states,
innovative approaches such as the application of compressed
sensing in QST have been proposed [27], [28]. Additionally,
regularization techniques to enhance the accuracy of QST were
introduced in . To predict properties of quantum states with
only a few measurements, shadow tomography methods have
been proposed in (30}, (BI. For QDT, the pioneering solution
method was Maximum Likelihood Estimation [17]. Subse-
quent methodologies include linear regression [16] and convex
optimization A recent advance in this field is a two-stage
estimation method characterized by analytical computational
complexity and an upper bound for the mean squared error
(MSE) [19]. Building upon this two-stage approach, Ref.
introduced an optimization of the probe states, while Ref.
examined regularization techniques in QDT. For QPT, three
main approaches are typically used, depending on the system
architecture: Standard Quantum Process Tomography [3], [34],
, Ancilla-Assisted Process Tomography , and
Direct Characterization of Quantum Dynamics

One appealing approach to quantum tomography is col-
lective tomography, although its applications have so far

been largely restricted to QST. Collective measurements on
multiple identically prepared state copies can extract more
information than individual measurements (each performed on
a single copy of the state), thereby enhancing information-
processing efficiency [39], [40]. Refs. [41], [42] demonstrated
an enhancement in fidelity using collective measurements
over separable methods in estimating mixed qubit states, and
Ref. showed that, in quantum state tomography, collective
measurements can achieve up to a d-fold improvement over
separable ones, where d is the system dimension. Furthermore,
collective symmetric informationally complete measurements
were investigated in [39], and experimentally demonstrated
in optics using two-copy collective measurements in [44],
. Ref. proposed genuine collective measurements for
QST, which was realized in an optical system through a
three-copy experiment [47]. More recently, Ref. demon-
strated provably optimal individual and two-copy collective
measurements on superconducting, trapped-ion, and photonic
platforms. Additionally, Ref. [49] explored a collective mea-
surement scheme for estimating the amount of coherence in
quantum states. Moreover, collective tomography can help
reduce the back action of quantum measurement [50], which
has been demonstrated in optical systems 4

Despite the above progress, existing research on collective
QST has largely been restricted to scenarios where multiple
copies of the quantum states are identical as p ®---®p, while
collective tomography approaches to QDT and QPT remain
relatively unexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a
generalized collective tomography uniting QST, QDT, and
QPT into a general framework considering S| ®--:@ Sp, with
each S$; representing identical or distinct states, detectors, or
processes from the same category. When S; 4 S; holds for
iF j, we refer to the task as D-QST, D-QDT, or D-QPT where
D implies distinct, and when S, = --- = S,, we refer to it as
I-QST, I-QDT, or I-QPT where I stands for identical.

We formulate these tasks as optimization problems with a
natural tensor structure for the unknown parameters, which
exhibit non-convexity and bilinearity. Building on this struc-
ture, we derive closed-form solutions tailored to each case,
and analyze both their computational complexities and MSE
scalings, which generalizes the previous result on QST
to all three classes of quantum tomography tasks. The com-
plexities are shown to be comparable to those of conventional
algorithms for individual QST, QDT, and QPT.

A limitation of the closed-form method is that it may yield
suboptimal solutions. To address this issue, we reformulate
the problems as sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization problems
with semi-algebraic constraints and solve them using SOS-
TOOLS [52]. This framework provides a rigorous lower bound
on the cost function. If the optimizer achieves the lower bound,
the bound corresponds to the global minimum. Otherwise, only
the bound is returned. To the best of our knowledge, this work
represents the first application of SOS optimization techniques
in collective tomography, marking a significant methodological
advance.

As benchmark cases, we apply our tomography methods
to estimate special cases including pure states, projective
measurements, and unitary processes. Numerical experiments

confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods: the closed-
form approach is computationally efficient but less accurate,
whereas SOS optimization achieves significantly higher accu-
racy at the expense of increased computational demand.

In addition, we validate our algorithms using experimental
data from [44], which demonstrated two-copy collective mea-
surements in QST via photonic quantum walks. The entangled
measurements in this setup yield information about the purity
of the quantum state, consistent with earlier theoretical
and experimental results for qubit systems. In contrast,
individual measurements cannot directly capture nonlinear
properties such as purity. Compared to the modified acceler-
ated projected-gradient algorithm of , our methods achieve
lower MSEs and approach the theoretical collective MSE
bound by exploiting this purity information.

The main contributions of this paper are summarized as
follows:

(i) We extend collective QST to a generalized collective

tomography framework that unifies QST, QDT, and
QPT, formulating all of these tasks as tensor-structured
optimization problems.

(ii) We derive closed-form solutions, analyze their computa-
tional complexities and MSE scalings, and also propose
SOS formulations that yield optimal solutions under
semi-algebraic constraints.

We provide illustrative examples, including pure states,
projective measurements, and unitary processes, and
verify the theoretical error analysis through numerical
simulations.

We validate the proposed methods using experimental
two-copy collective QST data from [44], demonstrating
that our algorithms achieve lower MSEs than existing
approaches and approach the collective MSE bound by
exploiting purity information.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion |I| formulates the problem of implementing generalized
collective QST, QDT, and QPT. Section[IM]presents the closed-
form algorithms and presents their computational complexities
and MSE scalings. Section[IV]introduces the SOS optimization
framework for collective QST, QDT and QPT, and Section [V]
provides both conceptual demonstrations and numerical sim-
ulations. Section validates the proposed methods using
experimental data. Finally, Section [VII] concludes the paper.

IJ. PROBLEM FORMULATION
A. Preliminary knowledge
For a matrix Amn, we introduce the vectorization function:
vec(Amxn) “[(A)11,(A)21,-++ ,(A)mt,(A)12,°++ ,(A)mas
++ 5(A)ins-*+ (A) mn)”

Similarly, vec! (.) maps a d? x 1 vector into a d x d square
matrix. One common property of vec(-) is :

()

vec(ABC) = (C’ @A) vec(B). (2)

A quantum state p € C4*@ must satisfy p =p’, p > 0 and
Tr(p) =1. When p =|w)(w| where |y) € C4 is a unit vector,
p is called a pure state. Otherwise, p is a mixed state. Here, we
define the following set to characterize all physical quantum
states in a d-dimensional Hilbert space:

Sa = {p eC’ :p =p',p >0,Tr(p) = i}. (3)

In quantum physics, measurement is ubiquitous, and the
measurement device is called a detector, which can be charac-
terized by a set of measurement operators denoted as {P;}4_,.
These L operators form a Positive-Operator-Valued Measure
(POVM), where each POVM element P, € C¢*@ adheres to
the conditions P; = Pt and P; > 0. Furthermore, they satisfy
the completeness constraint yh P = 14. Here, we define
the following set to characterize all physical d-dimensional
detectors:

Da= {{hh he Ch. =P), >0 Rath. @)
I

When a measurement operator P; is applied to a quantum
state p, the probability of obtaining the corresponding result
is governed by Born’s rule [3]:

pi=Tr(Pip). (5)

From the completeness constraint, we have yep =1.In
practical experiments, suppose that N identical copies of p
are consumed, and the /-th operator occurs N; times. Then
pi = N,/N serves as the experimental estimate of the true
value p;, with the associated measurement error denoted by
e: = pi — p: [19]. According to the central limit theorem,
the distribution of e; converges to a normal distribution with
mean zero and variance (p; — p7)/N {12}, [29]. Based on the
measurement data {p;}, the target of QST (QDT) is to identify
the unknown state (detector) using known POVM (measured
states, also called probe/input states).

For a d-dimensional quantum system, its dynamics can be
described by a completely-positive (CP) linear map € and QPT
aims to identify the unknown €. If we input a quantum state
p" € C4*4, using Kraus operator-sum representation [3], the
output state p™' is given by

We also call d the dimension of €. Choosing {E}“, as the
natural basis {| j)(k|}i<jx<a Bl. where i = (j—l)d+k
and {li Ho represents the standard basis in C4’. Conse-
quently, the natural basis {|j)(k|}i<jx<q is also a standard

basis in C¢%4. We expand {ajo as
a
Aji = ¥ cijEj- (8)
j=l

Define matrix (C);; 4 cjj, and in fact we have
C= [vec(Al),-- svec(AZ,)]", (9)

Also define the matrix X as X 4 C'C*, which is called
process matrix [3], and X € C#*4" ig in one-to-one
correspondence with €. In addition, it satisfies X¥ = X +x >
0,Tr; (X) < Jag. When the equality in holds, we have
Tr (X) =a Bi, and the process € or X is trace-preserving
(TP). Otherwise, the process is non-trace-preserving (non-TP)
which has indeed been demonstrated in experiment [23]. We
further define two sets to characterize all TP and non-TP
process matrices of dimension d:

pir {x ec’x? .y = xt x > 0,7 (X) =u} , (10)
and
Py? = {x ec’x x = xt x > 0,71 (X) <a} dab

The target for QPT is to identify the unknown process matrix

X using the known input states {p;? M_, and the measurement
operators {P}L where M and L are the numbers of different
kinds of input states and measurement operators, respectively.

State, process, and detector tomography constitute a com-
plete triad needed to fully define an experiment. Since p,
{P)}i_, and X are all Hermitian matrices, we introduce a
complete basis set of orthonormal operators {Q; He , in the

dimension d, satisfying Tr (ojo y= 6);. Each operator Q,; is

Hermitian, and Tr(Q;) =0 for all j except Q; =1/Vd. This
basis is employed in QST and QDT. For QPT, we utilize the
natural basis {| j)(k|}i<jk<a-

In the following subsections, we propose generalized col-
lective tomography for quantum states, detectors and quantum
processes.

B. Generalized collective QST

As illustrated in Fig. [I] we consider a two-copy generalized
collective QST, which includes two different scenarios. Case
(a) involves distinct unknown states, labeled as p} € Sg, and
p2 € Sa, collectively measured by {Py}, € Daya, on the
large space, and is referred to as D-QST in this paper. Case
(b) considers two identical copies of a state po, referred to
here as I-QST, which corresponds to the more commonly
studied setting in the collective QST literature [44], [48]. Since
we consider both cases, we term the approach generalized
collective QST.

For D-QST, we assume their dimensions 4 and d> cat sbe

different. Let the complete basis set be {Q; a 1) and {a}
respectively. Then we expand fp}, P2 into these bases as

from 6; to p; (i= 1,2) as hi(-) : R& 4 C4*4, Let the POVM

and the problem to identify p; and p2 with two-copy collective

and define /o(-) : R? > c4*4, where ho(@) = po. We can

also parameterize {P;}/_; € Dp to obtain &. Therefore, we
can formulate I-QST as the following problem.

Problem 2: Given the matrix ® and experimental data ?,

can also be extended to n-copy where the cost functions
for Problems |1| and [2] become ||Y — (6; @---@ @,) ||? and
\|Y —® (@,"") |F, respectively.

C. Generalized collective QDT

We then consider two-copy generalized collective QDT as
Fig. where we also consider two scenarios. In Case (a),
referred to as D-QDT, the unknown detectors are distinct as
{Pi} € Da, and {OVE € Da, which can be expanded in

and thus

Therefore, the problem to identify {P;}4_, and {Q,}&_, using
quantum states can be formulated as follows:

Problem 3: Given the matrix © and experimental data

where {h1($))}4_, € Da,, {ho(M)}_, € Da,-

Case (b), referred to as I-QDT, is also feasible in optical
experiments because a fiber delay line can be introduced [57],
, allowing us to use the same detector {P;}/_, € Dp twice
sequentially in time by switching between the two paths, as
shown in Fig. Pfc). A fiber delay line may introduce losses
and imperfections in practice. While our approach is capable
of modeling these effects, for simplicity, we assume them to
be negligible in this work.

Consequently, we can derive the following optimization
problem for I-QDT.

Problem 4: Given the matrix © and experimental data
{fix}, solve

Remark 2: Two-copy generalized collective QDT can also
be extended to n-copy collective QDT. For example, for I-
QDT, let oF be the parameterization vector for the k-th gubit of
the j-th POVM element and the measurement result is Yj, docealfus
The cost ney of Problem [4] becomes ified Pisjonin —

D. Generalized collective QPT
We consider generalized collective QPT as illustrated in Fig.
where the problem formulation is based on the natural basis
{|j)(kl}i<je<a rather than the basis {ase . We also analyze
two cases: in Case (a), referred to as D-QPT, the processes
are distinct with dimensions of €; and € being d, and do,
respectively. Let the Kraus operators for €),€ be falye,

B(Ka,a, ® Kaa) Kee (vec(X)) @ vee(X2)) = ¥. (26)

Let BS B(Kaya, ® Ka,a,)K 22. Therefore, the problem of
two-copy generalized collective QPT can be formulated as

Case (b) can be realized via, e.g., two delay lines and two
switches as shown in Fig. Bic). Moreover, we can also extend
the two-copy collective QPT to multiple-copy collective QPT,
as in Remarks [I] and 2]

Remark 3: For Case (a) in Fig. B] if & = Za, (identity
process), the framework reduces to Ancilla-Assisted Process
Tomography (AAPT) 3], 4], (35). A key advantage of
AAPT is that only a single input state with a full Schmidt
number is required to reconstruct the unknown process €.
However, in our case, we assume both €; and € are unknown
and distinct, making the framework more general than AAPT.
The price of this generalization is that it requires a larger set
of input states.

E. Weakly informational-complete scenario

In QST, measurements are informationally complete if their
outcome statistics uniquely determine the quantum state [59],
(60). This property can be verified by checking the rank of the
parameterization matrix of the measurement operators [29],
[59]. In collective tomography problems, we generalize this
notion as informationally complete scenarios, where the mea-
surement outcome statistics uniquely determine the unknown
quantum states, detectors, or processes. Since a rigorous
definition is challenging, tied to the uniqueness of solutions
to a nonconvex problem, we adopt a relaxed criterion for our
generalized collective tomography as follows.

Definition 1: The corresponding scenario is weakly
informational-complete if rank(®) = d?d3 in Problem
rank(®) = d* in Problem |2| rank(@) = d7d3 in Problem
rank(@) = d* in Problem |4{ rank(B) = did} in Problem|5], or
rank(B) = d® for I-QPT.

Note that for QPT, we have rank(B) = rank(B) because
(Kaya, ORaa) Kew is full-rank. Conversely, when the rank
of the linear map is smaller than the corresponding limit
in Definition we denote it as the weakly informational-
incomplete scenario. These rank-based criteria are easy to
verify, and weakly informational-completeness guarantees a
unique closed-form solution, though it is only a sufficient
condition for informational completeness and may be more

conservative than those in prior works on single-copy quantum

tomography (12}, (19), (221, (42).

III]. CLOSED-FORM SOLUTIONS

In this section, we present closed-form solutions for all
two-copy generalized collective quantum tomography. We will
describe the design of the algorithms and provide an analysis
of the computational complexities and MSE scalings. Addi-
tionally, we demonstrate how the algorithms can be extended
to three or more-copy scenarios while maintaining the same
MSE scalings.

A. Algorithm design

1) D-QST and I-QST: For the two-copy generalized collec-
tive QST in Problem [I] of D-QST, we decompose it into two
subproblems. The first subproblem is formulated as follows:

Problem 1.1: Given the matrix ® and experimental data
Y, solve min, ||¥ — @x||? where x € Rua,

For Problem[I.T]when ® is full-rank, we can obtain a unique

optimal estimate X using the least squares method

F=(0'0)'o’Y. (27)
When @ is rank-deficient, the data is insufficient to uniquely
determine the unknown. One possible reconstruction is given
by
F=f, (28)
where &+ denotes the Moore—Penrose (MP) inverse of ® [61].
Alternatively, we can incorporate a regularization term in the
cost function as ||? — ®x||? +x" Dx where D > 0 is a regular-
ization matrix. The closed-form estimate with regularization
is given by
F=(6'b+D)'o’y, (29)
The question of designing the regularization matrix D and cor-
responding hyperparameters in D has been discussed in 4

After obtaining %, the corresponding / is

Similar to (29), we can also obtain a closed-form solution with
a regularization term. Using 83). we reconstruct Pp as

We then consider the second sub-problem using p.
Problem 1.2: Let p € C%%2*4i42 be given. Solve
ming, p, ||6 — P1 ® P2|| where 61 € Sy,, P2 € Sa).
We can rearrange the elements of 6 and define a permuted
version as R(p) € C44 such that R(p; ® p2) =
vec((;) vec(62)". We thus know

|| — Bi ® Po|| = ||R(B) — vec (61) vec (A2)" ||. 5)

Problem|I.2]is a nearest Kronecker product problem [55], (66).
Using Co} Problem lean be solved efficiently by using the
singular value decomposition (SVD) because it is equivalent
to finding the nearest rank-1 matrix to a given matrix [55],
(66). If 6; and p> are the solutions, then a; and abo for
arbitrary @ € C also denotes a solution. Thus, we can choose
a proper @ € C such that Tr(f;) = 1. Further considering the
Hermitian constraints on (;,$2 and the unit trace constraint
on f2, we take

= at P at

~ Pith; ~ 1/ fo Po
, = at aa | i 36
Pi q > Pe 5 (fy is | (36)

where Tr(p;) = mlb Fe) =1 because Tr(6) = Tr(6}) = 1.
However, P,$2 may not satisfy the positive semidefinite con-
straint. To address this, we apply the fast correction algorithm
from [13] to the eigenvalues of 6 and obtain the final estimate
P1,P2 > 0 for Problem [I]

For Problem [of I-QST, after the same procedure as solving
Problem |[I.1] and Problem [1.2] we let

fo= Pi 7, (37)
which is a physical estimate because 6), 62 > 0 and Tr(p1) =

Tr(62) = 1.
Overall, the procedures in our closed-form algorithm consist
of four steps, as outlined in Fig. Al The pseudo-code for the

closed-form algorithm for D-QST is provided in Algorithm [I]
Similar to [12], we can derive the total online computational
complexity as O (Ld?d3 + dd} min(d?,d3)) for D-QST, and
O(Ld* +d°) for I-QST. The complexity is dominated by the
least-squares method in Step 2 and the SVD in Step 3 of Fig.
for generalized collective QST. These computational complex-
ities are of the same order as those of typical individual QST
with dimension djd) or d* {12}.

Remark 4: In Problem we adopt the Frobenius norm.
Alternatively, one may consider other metrics such as the
quantum relative entropy D(-||-), as discussed in [67]. In this
case, the minimization problem takes the form

min D(p||p1 © p2) , (38)
Pi-P2

where the optimal solution is given by the marginals 6; =

Tr2(P) and 62 = Tr (6). The corresponding minimum value of

quantum relative entropy coincides with the quantum mutual

information between the two subsystems in 6 [67].

2) D-QDT and I-QDT: We then consider a closed-form so-
lution for generalized collective QDT. We also split Problem3]
into to two subproblems. The first subproblem is similar to
Problem where the least squares estimate in the weakly
informational-complete scenario is

by. = (970) 10" Fy. (39)

We can also utilize MP inverse or regularization in the weakly
informational-incomplete scenario, which is similar to (28) and
(29). Then we reconstruct Rj, as

aids
Ru = Yi Gu )i-1a34j(Qi ®E)).-

ij=l

(40)

We ultimately derive a total of KL distinct Rj, because 1 <
ISLASK<K.

We then consider the second subproblem using {Rj,} as
follows:

Problem 3.2: Let Ry € CH2*44 be given. Solve

: zr, 5 Boh 5
mins) (6,3 Liket Rix — FP; ® Oy||? where {Pj} € Dg, and
{Ox} € Day.

Define a matrix collecting all of {R(Rix)} as follows:
R(Ru) R(Ri2) R(Rix)
R=]: Dot, @D
RR) R(Ri2) R(Rix)

where R € C/4i**4, Define the vectors of all By and O; as

vec(P) = [vec(P\)",--- wvee(P,)"]",

- <P erat (42)
vec(Q) = [vec(Q1)",--- ,vec(Qx)"|
and thus
L.K 7 . 7 7 7 oo
Y [Ru —F @ Ox|l? = ||R—vec(P) vec(Q)"||?.. (43)
Lk=1

Therefore, similar to Problem|!.2| this can be solved by using
the SVD. However, note that @P and 10 (for any a@ € C)
are also solutions. Since Tr(Y/_, P;) = di, we can fix @ such
that Tr(YEy P) = d, which then determines the corresponding
OnE

To satisfy the Hermitian constraint, we define
— A+
9° ‘ 2
However, these estimates may not satisfy the completeness and
positive semidefinite constraints. To enforce these, we apply
the Stage-2 algorithm of [19], yielding the final estimates
{Pi}, and {On}.

For I-QDT, we obtain the following optimization problem
using R), for the second subproblem as follows:

Problem 4.2: Let Rix € CHxA be given. Solve

Similarly, we can define R, P, and @ as in and (42),
and obtain

Yi Ru -F @ Py|\? = ||R — vec(P) vec(P)" ||.
Lk=1
This formulation differs from Problem B.2] in that the tensor
terms are identical.
To address this, we first consider a relaxed version in which
the terms are allowed to be distinct:

(45)

Y Ru —F, @ Ox\? = || — vec(P) vec()" ||,

be solved using the SVD [55], [66], yielding F, such that
Tr(Lhy PB) = d. Following the same procedure as in D-QDT,
we then obtain the final estimates {P;}4_,.

Overall, the procedures of our closed-form algorithm in-
volve four steps, as outlined in Fig. 5] The pseudo-code of the
closed-form algorithm for D-QDT is provided in Algorithm P]
Similar to [19], the total online computational complexities
can be derived as O(MKLd7d3 + KLd;d} min(Ld;,Kd3)) for
D-QDT, and O(ML7d* + L3d°) for I-QDT. These complexities
are dominated by the least-squares method in Step 2 and the
SVD in Step 3 of Fig. [5] for generalized collective QDT. The
resulting orders of complexity are comparable to those of
typical individual QDT with KL different POVM elements of
dimension did, or L? different POVM elements of dimension

d? {19}.
3) D-QPT and I-QPT: We finally design a closed-form
solution for two-copy generalized collective QPT in Problem
We first obtain the least squares solution

X = vee"! (BB) 'B'Y). (47)

In the weakly informational-incomplete scenario, we can also
use the MP inverse or regularization, similar to and (29).
We then consider the following problem for D-QPT.

Problem 5.2: Let X € Céidixdid? he given. Solve
ming, x, ||X —X1 @Xo|| where X; € PE /PR.

If € (i= 1,2) is TP, we have Tr(X;) = d;. For example, if
Tr(X;) =}, similar to Problem [1-2] we can obtain a unique
optimal solution X; and X) via SVD, ensuring that Tr(X,) =
d,. To correct the solutions so that they satisfy the Hermitian
constraint, we let

z 2a
If they are both TP, we have Tr(X,) = d,Tr(X2) = do. After
the first equality in (48), we take

~ mf X% xy
X= = = =F :
2 Tr(X2) Tr(X;)
However, if both €; and € are non-TP, the solution to
Problem Ea is not unique because BX; and pe are also

solutions. “To obtain a unique estimation in this case, we
prepare maximally mixed state p = at and implement P = I,

1= (48)

(49)

on the output state €| (H), and then obtain a real positive 0
from measurement result, which is an estimate of Tr(X1)/d1.
To determine B, we rescale X, such that Tr(X;) = dia) and
obtain the corresponding X>. These state and measurement
operators are relatively straightforward to generate in an
experimental setup. Then we obtain the estimates to satisfy
Hermitian constraint

j _Xi+X % = Xe +X

For I-QPT, similar to I-QDT, we can first obtain Xo = za Bis

and in the non-TP case as

Finally, to satisfy the partial trace constraint for TP or non-
TP process, we implement the algorithm in and obtain
the final estimate xX and X for D-QPT or Xo for I-QPT.

Overall, the procedures of our closed-form algorithm have
four steps as outlined in Fig. [6] Similar to [22], we can
derive the overall computational complexity O(d}d3(ML +
dd min(d},d3)) for D-QPT and O(d4(ML+d®)) for I-QPT,
which is dominated by reconstructing theoutput states in Step
1, the least squares method in Step 2 and the SVD in Step 3
in Fig. [6] for generalized collective QPT.

B. Error analysis

Throughout the paper, we use N to denote the number of
input state copies in each generalized collective protocol. In
D/I-QST, N corresponds to the number of state pairs. We
also use E(-) to denote the expectation with respect to all the
possible measurement results. Here we present the following
theorems to describe the analytical MSE scaling using our
closed-form algorithm for all generalized collective tomogra-
phy procedures. First, we propose the following theorem for
generalized collective QST.

Theorem 1: In the weakly informational-complete sce-
nario, the MSE scalings of our algorithm satisfy E||6; —
pi||? = O(1/N) and E||62 — p2||? = O(1/N) for D-QST, and
E||Bo — po||? = O(1/N) for L-QST.

Proof:

1) Error in Steps I and 2: We collect data and utilize the
least squares method. Thus for D-QST, we have

E||t— 61 @ ||

ment result Y [12]. If we implement (33), we also have

Remark 5: If we adopt the quantum relative entropy
D(-||-) as in Remark [4] and apply Lemma in Appendix
the mean-square errors of the optimal solution satisfy E||6; —
p1||? = O(1/N) and E||p2 — p2||? = O(1/N). Furthermore, by
eee piped we obtain E[D((1||pi)] = O(1/N)
and E[D(f2||p2)] = O(1/N) when p; and pz have full rank.
Otherwise, if p; and p2 are rank-deficient, the quantum relative
entropy may be infinite :

We then propose the following theorem for generalized
collective QDT.

Theorem 2: In the weakly informational-complete sce-
nario, the MSE scalings of our algorithm satisfy EYE, ||A —

P| =O(1/N) and ELE, ||Ox— Ox||? = O (1/N) for D-QDT
and EL}; ||P; — P|? = 0 (1/N) for 1-QDT.

Proof: For D-QDT, similar to collective QST, we have

Hence,

Similarly, we can show E||P; — P;||? = O(1/N).

Theorem 3: In the weakly informational-complete sce-

nario, the MSE scalings of our algorithm satisfy E||X -
Xj ||? = O(1/N) and E||X — Xs||? = O(1/N) for D-QPT and
E||Xo — Xo||? = O(1/N) for -QPT.

We omit the proof here because the proofs for D-QPT and
I-QPT are similar to those of Theorems [I] and 2] respectively.

C. Extension to n-copy (n > 3) cases

It is straightforward to extend our closed-form algorithm
to n-copy (n > 3) scenarios. For n-copy (n > 3) collective
QST, a similar procedure can be applied. In D-QST, we first
use the least squares method, and then solve the optimization
problem ming,.....4, ||6 — P1 ®---® Pn||. We start by solving
ming, p>, || — Pi ® P2n||, where Pon € CYax(n—Id and
then proceed with ming, 6,., ||P2:n — 62 @ Ps:n||. This step-by-
step approach allows us to obtain a closed-form solution using
the SVD like Problem For error analysis, similar to (64).
we have

~ 1 ~ 1
E||A1 — pill” O( 5) Blo Poll o(5): (91)

Through step-by-step decoupling of the tensor product, we can
further show

a 1 .
Blp;- pl’ =0( =). I<j<n.

(92)

We then implement the correction algorithms from and
thus E||6;— pill" = O(1/N),1 <j <n. For -QST, we com-

pute po = —= =i) , and similar to (78), we obtain

in 1
E||6o — poll? = O (x) .

For n-copy (n > 3) generalized collective QDT and QPT,
we also begin with the least squares method. In D-QDT and
D-QPT, we can similarly achieve closed-form solutions using
step-by-step SVD decomposition. As with D-QST, we can
prove that the MSE scalings are O(1/N). For I-QDT and I-
QPT, one solution is to first use step-by-step SVD decompo-
sition similar to D-QDT and D-QPT for n > 3, followed by
averaging all the estimates. Similar to I-QST, the MSE still
scales as O(1/N).

(93)

IV. SUM OF SQUARES OPTIMIZATION

The above closed-form solution is computationally efficient,
but it may be suboptimal due to the relaxation introduced by
decomposing the problem into two subproblems. To pursue an
optimal solution that respects the original tensor structure in
collective tomography, we propose a sum of squares (SOS)
optimization approach in this section.

Testing the polynomial nonnegativity condition

PIR) = PO 4%) © 0 (94)

for all x € R” is NP-hard, even when p(x) is of degree
4. However, a more tractable sufficient condition for the
nonnegativity of p(x) is for it to be a sum of squares (SOS)
polynomial. This means that p(x) can be expressed as

=¥ PQ)
i=l

for some polynomials f;(x). Determining whether a polyno-
mial is a sum of squares reduces to solving a semidefinite
program (SDP), a class of convex optimization problems for
which efficient numerical solution methods are available. Since
the cost function of the collective tomography problem is

(95)
a polynomial that is always non-negative, we can use SOS
optimization to solve this problem. The problem of obtaining a
lower bound for the global minimum of a polynomial function
using SOS optimization is discussed in detail in [68].

For collective QST, we need to consider the constraints on
quantum states. The Hermitian and the unit trace constraints
on quantum ers have been epeatvaly satisfied by selecting

the basis {a,}4 i and fone . The positive semidefinite
constraints of quantum states are complicated and can be
characterized by a semi-algebraic set. These constraints have
been extensively addressed in literature [69], [70], and we
can use the following lemma to describe the physical set
characterizing the parameterized vector of a quantum state,
e.g., O.

with Ka = kd = 1. Define the semi-algebraic set
Ka = {0 €R® : k4(h(6)) > 0,p = 2,--- ,d}. (97)

Then A(-) (defined after (72) is an isomorphism between Ky
and Sy.

Thus, we propose to solve Problem |1| by addressing the
following optimization problem:

For collective QDT, the Hermitian constraints on {P)}4_,
and {O.}—_ 1 have also been effectively satisfied by selecting

the bases {Q,}; a and {= ye |- Furthermore, the completeness
constraints on {P;)}!4, and Ok. , can be expressed as

For each POVM element P;, we can also normalize it to
a density matrix and obtain the similar semi-algebraic set.
Hence, P; is positive semidefinite if and only if

and for TP processes, the partial trace constraint becomes
Try (X1) = Ja, ,Tr1 (Xz) = Ia,. For I-QPT, we just need to change
X, and Xp to Xo.

All the above constrained polynomial optimization prob-
lems can be efficiently solved using findbound function
in SOSTOOLS [52]. This function yields a lower bound y
for the cost function. When findbound also returns values
for the optimization variables (e.g., 60), it implies that the
lower bound is attainable, and hence y corresponds to the
global minimum of the cost function. However, in some cases,
findbound may fail to return feasible variable values if the
lower bound is unattainable. In such cases, the obtained lower
bound can still serve as a reference for evaluating candidate
estimates, allowing us to select the one closest to y. Different
regularization matrices, as outlined in (29. can be used to
obtain possible candidates. Nevertheless, when findbound
function does return values for the optimization variables, it
indicates that these values achieve the lower bound. Conse-
quently, this lower bound represents the minimum value of
the cost function in the original problem.

Based on the effectiveness of SOS optimization, we propose
using SOS tests with the property that, even in the weakly
informational-incomplete scenario, SOS can also provide a
unique optimal solution. For collective QST, after preparing
the measurement operators, we can directly implement them
in experiments and use the experimental data to solve the
optimization problems given by or 9. If we obtain a
solution, it is guaranteed to be optimal. Otherwise, additional
measurement operators may be needed to determine a unique
solution. As demonstrated in [44], [47], using two-copy {139)-
and three-copy (141) collective measurement can yield
a unique optimal solution with L = 5,9 different measurement
operators. An interesting open problem is how to choose
further measurement operators when a unique optimal solution
cannot be found through SOS optimization. Addressing this
challenge could lead to more effective strategies for selecting
measurement operators in collective QST. A similar SOS test
can also be applied to collective QDT and collective QPT,
which may require fewer probe states and input states, there-
fore being more practically feasible in experimental settings.

V. EXAMPLES AND NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section, we present illustrative examples and numer-
ical simulations to demonstrate the implementation and per-
formance of our proposed generalized collective tomography.

A. Illustrative examples

In this subsection, we consider several illustrative exam-
ples to demonstrate the implementation of our generalized
collective tomography method. We begin by employing prior
information indicating that the unknown state is pure for
QST, a useful property in quantum technologies, simplifying
the constraints in SOS optimization. Similarly, we consider
that the POVM elements are projective in QDT. Finally,
we consider the problems of collective Hamiltonian/unitary
tomography.

1) Pure state and projective measurement tomography:
Pure states are important quantum resources and widely ap-
plied in experiments. Thus, we may assume prior knowledge
that the unknown states p; = |w;)(w;| (i= 1,2) are pure states.
Using (2), we have

vec(|Wi) (Wil) =|wi)* ® |wi), i= 1,2. (104)

Using {104} and Lemma P2]in Appendix [A] we have

vec(p1 ® p2) = (la, @ Kandy ® Iu) (vec(p1) @ vec(p2))
= (la, ® Kaya ® Lay) (\Wa)* ® |W) ® |W2)* ® |Yo)). 1)
Therefore, we have

Pi = Tr(Pi(p1 ® p2))
= (vec(F)))* vec(p1 ® pa)
= (vee(P))* (La, @ Kaya; @ lay) (\Wi)* @|Wi) @ |o)* @ vay.
Denote v; = (la, @ Kaa, @la)” vec(P;)* and Y = [v1,02,:--,
wl. Hence, Problem|1} becomes as follows:
Problem 6: Given the matrix Y and experimental data Y,
solve

min ||? —Y(|y1)* @|y1) @|y2)* ® Lye) II?
Iva). Y2)
where |y,) € C4", |yo) € C® are unit vectors.

To solve this problem with a closed-form solution, we
can first implement Algorithm [1] in Sec. and ob-
tain 6; and 6). Assuming the spectral decomposition 6; =

0; diag(A,,--- Aa, OF where A, >
of the input pure state is

“> hay , the final estimate

/{ =O; diag(1,0,--- 0). (107)

Similarly, we can obtain the final estimate 65 and prove that
the final MSE scalings of the quantum states are still O(1/N).
Although the algorithm is still closed-form and can achieve
O(1/N) MSE scaling, it does not utilize the pure state prior
information and only satisfies the pure constraint by correction.
Alternatively, we can also formulate it as an SOS problem

min (—7)
s.t. ||? —Y(|yi)* @|y1) @|Y2)* @|y2)) ||? — 7 is SOS,
Ivi) €C%, Jy) €C®, |I|Yi) | = lye) ll = 1,
(108)

which utilizes the pure state prior information in the cost
function and thus does not need to consider the unit trace
and positive semidefinite constraint anymore.
ror collective QDT in Problem} [3] if the POVM is projective,
= |0))(@|, we can correct the eigenvalues of {PF}
as 0 and the MSE still scales as O(1/N). We can also
formulate it as an SOS optimization, where the cost function
becomes

Y lor) (1] = Lars YE 19k) (Gk! = te
I=1 k=1

(|91)* ® |61) ® |x)* ®|gx)) |? — 7 is SOS,

(109)
Hence we do not need to consider the positive semidefinite
constraint on POVM elements anymore.

2) Unitary/Hamiltonian tomography: If the unknown quan-
tum process €, is unitary driven by the Hamiltonian H, we
have X, = vec(G,) vec(G,)*, where G, is a unitary operator
[24]. Thus, using 2), we have

vec(X;) = vec(G1)* ® vec(G1). (110)

Since rank(X;) = 1, we can apply a similar procedure to that
for the pure state case by correcting the eigenvalues of X1.
After this correction, it is not difficult to prove that the MSE
scaling E||G, — G,||? is still O(1/N). Using the Hamiltonian
reconstructing algorithm in [24], the MSE scaling of the
Hamiltonian E||A — Aj ||* is still O(1/N).

Using the SOS optimization, for D-QPT, we have

min (—7)
s.t. ||? — B(vec(G1)* ® vec(G1)

B. Numerical results

In this subsection, we present three numerical examples:
two-copy and three-copy collective QST, two-copy collective
QDT, and two-copy collective phase damping process tomog-
raphy. The simulations were conducted on a laptop with an
Intel i9-13980HX processor and 64 GB of DDRS memory.
For each data point in the figures shown in this section, we
repeated our algorithm 100 times and computed the mean to
obtain the MSE and error bars. The random unitary matrices
and random probe states used in these simulations were
generated using the algorithms in [71], [72].

1) Two-copy and three-copy collective QST: For D-QST,
let the unknown initial quantum states be

p =U diag(0.9,0.1)Uf,

: (113)
po =Urdiag(0.8,0.2)U,

where U, and U) are randomly generated unitary matrices that
are subsequently fixed throughout the process. For this one-
qubit example of SOS optimization, 61,02 € K are equivalent
to Y}5(01)? < 5, Li-o(@)? < 4 because of the Bloch sphere
representation [69], (70). Thus, the SOS optimization can be
reformulated as

min (—7)
s.t. ||P — & (0; @ @) ||? — y is SOS,

(91): = (@)1=—, (114)

i=2 i=2

We utilize mutually unbiased basis (MUB) measurements as
defined in (37 for this case, and the results are presented
in Fig. fl The MSE scalings of both the closed-form (CF)
solution and the SOS optimization are O(1/N), which is
consistent with Theorem [I] Additionally, the MSEs of the CF
solution are slightly smaller than those of the SOS optimiza-
tion. This occurs because minimizing the cost function does
not necessarily minimize the MSE of the parameters.

For I-QST, let the unknown state be

po = Udiag(1,0)Ut (115)

which is a pure state and U is a randomly generated matrix
and then fixed in the simulation. We then implement the
individual symmetric, informationally complete POVM (SIC-
POVM) {138}, the two-copy collective POVM
and the three-copy collective POVM (I41), as detailed in
Appendix B} To ensure that the total number of resources
is consistent across the different POVM implementations, we
set No a shared value among these different schemes while
N = 6M) for individual SIC-POVM, N = 3No for the two-copy
collective POVM and N = 2Np for the three-copy collective
POVM. In this simulation, findbound can always output
values of the optimization variable 0 and thus the lower bound
y is the minimum value of the cost function.

The results obtained via SOS optimization are shown in
Fig. [8] where all MSE scalings follow O(1/N) and the per-
formance differences remain minor. The three-copy collective
POVM exhibits MSE behavior comparable to that of the two-
copy counterpart, indicating that in practical scenarios the two-
copy implementation may already suffice, providing a simpler
alternative while still achieving lower MSE. In contrast, the
experimental results in Ref. demonstrate that the three-
copy collective measurement can attain a higher fidelity.

2) Two-copy collective QDT: Here we focus on I-QDT for
collective QDT, where we consider a three-valued detector
(L = 3) defined as

P, =U; diag (0.4,0.1) Uj,
P> = Up diag (0.5,0.1)U3,
P3=I-P,—P,>0,

(116)

where U; and U2 are randomly generated unitary matrices
and then fixed in the simulation. For this one-qubit example
using SOS optimization, the condition @; € K is equivalent to

We randomly generate M = 20 different probe states that
are weakly informational-complete and M = 4 different probe
states that are weakly informational-incomplete, and then
fix them in the simulation. For a closed-form solution, we
add regularization D = 107 in the weakly informational-
incomplete scenario.

The results are presented in Figs. [9] and [10] In Fig. [9
all MSE scalings follow O(1/N), which is consistent with
Theorem |2} In the weakly informational-incomplete scenario
shown in Fig. |10| the MSE of SOS optimization still scales
as O(1/N), even when using only four random probe states.
For the closed-form solution with regularization, the MSE
decreases for N < 10°, and it is smaller than that of the SOS
optimization when N < 10*. However, as N increases, the
MSE remains nearly constant. This behavior arises because,
for N > 10° in the weakly informational-incomplete scenario,
the estimates Rj in ) deviate from the true values, which
impedes the convergence, as similarly proved in [33].

Table[[jillustrates the consumption time for both the closed-
form solution and SOS optimization corresponding to Figs. 9
and [10] The closed-form solution shows significantly lower
time consumption compared to SOS optimization. While the
closed-form solution is faster, it often sacrifices accuracy.
In contrast, SOS optimization offers higher accuracy but
requires considerably more computational time. Thus, there
is a trade-off between accuracy and consumption time for
these two algorithms. Additionally, the closed-form solution
necessitates a large number of distinct probe states to ensure
weak informational completeness. However, SOS optimization
can achieve high accuracy with a significantly reduced number
of probe states.

Moreover, probing with the last eight MUB states from the
MUB basis of (137. we compare our results against theoretical
precision bounds for QDT proposed in [73]. These theoretical
bounds, stemming from the Cramér-Rao theorem, leverage
quantum-statistical principles to lower-bound the minimum
MSE achievable in unbiased detector estimation. The classical
Cramér-Rao bound captures the minimum MSE for given
probe states, whereas the quantum Cramér-Rao bound captures
the minimum MSE for the optimal probe states. The result of
our comparison is shown in Fig Our SOS solution is close
to the classical Cramér-Rao bound, given by

log 9 MSE = 1.1978 — logi)N.

Interestingly, the SOS solution is observed to be even lower
than the classical bound. This effect may be attributed to bias
in the estimates using our algorithms, which can lead to a
lower MSE. In contrast, there remains a gap between our
results and the quantum Cramér-Rao bound, given by

log;9 MSE = 0.4669 — log) N.

However, it remains an open question as to whether the
quantum bound, which was proven tight for phase-insensitive
measurements, is attainable in this case [73].

3) Two-copy collective bit-phase flip process tomography:
For collective QPT, we consider the bit-phase flip process
which is TP. The corresponding Kraus operators are given by

A= vp| ; |: A= yT=p| ° 0 |: (118)
where | — p denotes the probability that the qubit undergoes
a bit-phase flip error [3].

For D-QPT, we set pi = 0.8 for the process €; and p2 = 0.7
for the process €, and construct the corresponding process
matrices X;, X2. We input 16 randomly generated and then
fixed different quantum states and the measurement is MUB
in (137). In the closed-form solution, we first reconstruct the
full process matrix X and decouple it to give X; and X,
from which we determine the optimal flipping probabilities
P and pz. Subsequently, we reconstruct the estimated process
matrices xX and X using p; and >. In contrast, the SOS
optimization method directly identifies the probability param-
eters p; and pp. The results, presented in Fig. [I] show that
the MSE scalings are O(1/N), in agreement with Theorem
Additionally, the MSE of the SOS optimization is significantly
smaller than that of the closed-form solution. This is because
the closed-form solution does not fully leverage the structural
properties of the process matrix in the optimization.

For I-QPT, we set p = 0.8 and construct the corresponding
process matrix Xo. In this case, we input only one random
state. Under the same conditions as D-QPT, the results are
presented in Fig. The MSE scaling for SOS optimization
remains O(1/N), while the MSE of the closed-form solution
with regularization does not change when N > 103°. Results
indicate that SOS optimization is particularly suitable for
problems with structural properties and a smaller number of
unknown parameters.

we can only obtain linear information about the unknown
parameters. This is because the measurement data can always
be expressed as 6 = Tr(P;p) = yh 1 9;9;. In contrast, collective
measurements allow us to obtain nonlinear information about
the unknown parameters [53], as the purity of the qubit
illustrated in (119) [54]. This analysis highlights the significant
role of entanglement in enhancing the efficiency of quantum
tomography.

Based on this collective measurement, we modify our
closed-form solution and SOS optimization. Using POVM
elements pe?) for 1<1<4, we have

r= Te (3 (ivi) wd) = 2 (vila)?

Therefore, using measurement data {f;}/_, and LRE , we
obtain a unique estimate, expressed as p. Let

ployed our modified closed-form solution together with SOS
optimization techniques. The results, shown in Fig.[14] demon-
strate that both methods outperform the algorithm of [44],
with MSE scalings approximately O(1/N). Furthermore, our
approaches closely follow the collective bound (131). under-
scoring their effectiveness for quantum state reconstruction.

VII. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we extended collective quantum state tomog-
raphy to a generalized collective framework encompassing
quantum state, detector, and process tomography. These tasks
were formulated as optimization problems, and we developed a
closed-form algorithm with explicit computational complexity
and MSE scalings. In addition, we reformulated the problems
as SOS optimization with semi-algebraic constraints, which,
except for the D-QST case, achieve higher accuracy at the cost
of increased computation time. We also investigated several
illustrative examples, including pure quantum states, projective
measurements, and unitary processes.

The proposed methods were validated through numerical
simulations and further tested using experimental data, where
collective measurements provided additional purity informa-
tion about the state. Compared to previous algorithms, our
methods can achieve lower MSEs and approach the collective
MSE bound. Future work will study the adaptivity of the col-
lective tomography algorithms and extend their applicability
to larger-scale and more complex quantum systems.

researcher, working on the development of large-scale higher-order quantum
entanglement using time-domain multiplexing technologies—a circuit that
provided the platform for the demonstration of quantum supremacy. She then
continued her research at the Joint Quantum Institute in a Nobel Prize winning
group, where she investigated quantum information processing and laser phase
locking based on four-wave mixing in rubidium vapours. Her research interests
include quantum optics, quantum metrology, quantum communications, and
optical quantum computing.
