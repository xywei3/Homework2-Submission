Magnetic bimerons, similar to skyrmions, are topologically nontrivial spin textures characterized by topolog-
ical charge Q. Most studies so far have focused on low-Q solitons (|Q| < 1), such as skyrmions, bimerons,
and vortices. Here, we present the first calculations of the lifetimes of high-Q bimerons and demonstrate that
they are fundamentally more stable than high-Q skyrmions over a wide range of temperature. To obtain realistic
results, our chosen system is an experimentally feasible van der Waals interface, Fe3GeTe2/Cr2Ge2Tes. We
show that the lifetimes of high-Q (anti)bimerons can exceed the lifetime of those with |Q| = 1 by 3 orders
of magnitude. Remarkably, this trend remains valid even when extrapolated to room temperature (RT), as the
lifetimes are dominated by entropy rather than energy barriers. This contrasts with high-Q skyrmions, whose
lifetimes fall with |Q| near RT. We attribute this fundamental difference between skyrmions and bimerons to

their distinct magnetic texture symmetries, which lead to different entropy-dominated lifetimes.

Topological magnetic solitons — localized vortex-like spin
structures m : R? — S? with non-trivial topology — show
great promise for spintronic applications . Their spin tex-
tures can be characterized by a topological invariant Q, also
known as topological charge

m* (ex) ar, (1)

While solitons with the same charge can be homotopically
transformed into each other, a transformation with topological
phase transition invokes a singular spin configuration, which
is usually accompanied by a finite energy barrier [3]. This
leads to the concept of topological protection.

Over the past decade, solitons with |Q| < 1, such as
skyrmions, skyrmionium, bimerons, and vortices, have been
comprehensively studied. These solitons are typically stabi-
lized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMJ, and
they can be as small as the nanoscale [4/6], move efficiently
under current [7|{8], allow topological spin switching by op-
tical pulses (i.e., ultrafast control) [OUT], and can be de-
tected all-electrically [[2414]. Recently, the study has pro-
gressed to high-Q solitons (|Q| > 1) such as skyrmion bun-
dles or skyrmion bags [IS¥17]. These high-Q solitons not
only promise rich and novel physics but also offer unique
properties for future spintronic applications, such as higher
topological complexity for information encoding and a
reduced skyrmion Hall angle [19] for efficient information
transmission.

However, the formation mechanisms of high-Q solitons and
their stability remain largely unexplored. In particular, the
average lifetimes 7 of high-Q solitons, usually described by

are unknown. The lifetime calculations are challenging due to
the complexity of identifying the minimum energy path in a
complex energy surface and the need to determine both the en-
ergy barrier AE and the entropic contributions incorporated
in the pre-exponential factor 9. Therefore, even for low-Q
solitons, lifetimes have been investigated by only a very lim-
ited number of groups worldwide [20425]. In particular, the
transition mechanisms and lifetimes of high-Q solitons have
not been reported so far.

In this Letter, we present the first calculations of the
lifetimes of high-Q solitons and demonstrate that high-Q
bimerons are a much more promising platform for spin-
tronic applications than high-Q skyrmions. We demonstrate
the main idea using a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure,
Fe3GeTe2/Cr2Ge2Teg (FGT/CGT). We predict that high-Q
bimerons and antibimerons can coexist at zero field with ar-
bitrary Q. Combining first-principles calculations with transi-
tion state theory, we further demonstrate that their lifetimes
are enhanced by several orders of magnitude compared to
those of low-Q counterparts over a wide temperature range,
even at room temperature (RT). In contrast, the lifetimes
of high-Q skyrmions are shorter than those of their low-Q
counterparts near RT. We argue that this contrast arises from
entropy-driven stability, which is governed by the symmetries
of their magnetic textures.

We consider an all-magnetic vdW heterostructure com-
posed of FGT and CGT (see Fig.[{I{a)), which was recently
synthesized experimentally [26]. In this work, we focus on
solitons in the CGT layer, which exhibit a delicate balance
between exchange frustration and DMI, combined with in-
plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE), as dis-
cussed below. In CGT, the Cr atoms form a two-dimensional
honeycomb lattice comprising two Cr atoms per unit cell (see

Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Material (SM) [27]). To investi-
gate magnetic interactions of the CGT layer, we map our DFT
total energies to the following spin Hamiltonian for Cr atoms:

H=—-S0 Ji (me-mj)— > Djj-(mixmj)—K \_ (m7),
(3)

where m, and m, are unit magnetic moment vectors at lattice
sites i and 7. The three terms denote Heisenberg exchange
(Jij), DMI (Dj;), and MAE (Kx).

Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict
that CGT exhibits exchange frustration, in which short- and
long-range interactions compete with each other (Fig. [ifa),
for computational details, see SM Sec. S1 [27]]). Addition-
ally, the DMI arises from inversion symmetry breaking and
spin-orbit coupling induced by the adjacent FGT layer, which
makes it promising to study the interplay between these two
interactions in stabilizing higher-order topological spin tex-
tures. Finally, the in-plane MAE of CGT favors bimerons as
metastable configurations.

Our spin dynamics simulations with the spin Hamiltonian
parameterized by first-principles predict the emergence of
nanoscale bimerons (Q < 0) and antibimerons (Q > 0) for
arbitrary Q (Fig. [I]b), top). We used 80x80 lattices (2-atom
per unit cell) in this work to obtain well-converged results.
As reported in Ref. [28], bimerons and antibimerons have
long-range spatial profiles. Interestingly, we find that high-

Q bimerons are much more localized, which can be related
to them always forming ring-like structures to minimize
their energy (see SM Sec. $2 (27). For fair comparison with
skyrmions, we switch the MAE to out-of-plane (Fig [I[b), bot-
tom), i.e. changing only the sign of A. In addition, a slight
adjustment to the interactions is required to stabilize Q = 1
antiskyrmions (see SM Sec. $3 [27]), since they are not stabi-
lized by DMI but rely on frustrated exchange instead. Field-
induced bimeron-skyrmion conversion occurs at low Q [28]
but fails at high Q due to large Zeeman penalties (SM Sec. S4
[27)). These bimerons appear symmetric to their antibimeron
counterparts, whereas skyrmions are asymmetric with anti-
skyrmions. As we will demonstrate in the following, one im-
portant aspect of our study is to understand the fundamental
difference between high-Q bimerons and skyrmions.

To understand high-Q soliton formation, we compute the
binding energy Eya = E(Q) — |Q|E(+£1), describing the en-
ergy gain when |Q| primitive solitons with charge +1 com-
bine. Eya is symmetric for bimerons vs. antibimerons but
asymmetric for skyrmions vs. antiskyrmions (Fig. [I{e)), and
its negative sign indicates that high-Q states are favored. Of-
ten, the binding is barrierless (SM Sec. $5 [27]). The inter-
facial DMI density ¢,; = (fi; x2) - (mj; xmy) (arrows show
in-plane m; ||) reveals that skyrmions have uniform <, whereas
antiskyrmions show ¢ < 0 along x and € > 0 along y. Soli-
tons with regions of opposite € can rotate to facilitate barrier-
less binding ] (Animation 1, SM [27}), including high-

Q skyrmions and bimerons. High-Q states thus form sponta-
neously upon close approach, except for repulsive Q = —1
skyrmions.

To quantify the thermal stability of solitons, we com-
pute lifetimes using harmonic transition state theory (HTST)
(see SM Sec. S1 for theory and computational details).
Since the binding process is generally barrierless, lifetimes
are solely determined by collapses. In our case, the collapse
of a high-Q soliton into the ferromagnetic (FM) ground state
typically proceeds through a series of step-by-step transitions
Q > Q' with |Q| — 1 = |Q’|, as shown in Fig. 2a).

Within the harmonic approximation, the Arrhenius law
(Eq. (2) gives the lifetime in terms of the AE and To. The
energy barriers AF’ between neighboring topological charges
(inset of Fig. 2{a)) are shown in Fig. [2{b) for all transitions
Q —> Q'. Here, AE(Q) increases with |Q| and saturates
near |(Q| = 3 for both bimerons and skyrmions. As shown
in Fig. hc), this behavior stems from the exchange interac-
tion, which dominates the stability of all solitons. The Q-
dependent exchange energy contribution can be understood
via two subprocesses (Fig. [2{d)): (1) unbinding a single (anti-
)bimeron from the ring structure and (II) its subsequent col-
lapse. The unbinding costs an equal share of the total bind-
ing energy, AE; = —Epa(Q)/|Q|, while the collapse energy
AEj is shown in Fig. 2b) for Q = +1. Our energy barrier

model AE(Q) © AE(Q) + AEn then simply reads

indicating that the increased energy barriers for high-Q soli-
tons originate from binding energy.

,

This model allows for numerical verification by comparing
the energy barrier differences AE(Q) — AE(+
with the binding energy (Fig. PI). considering only the ex-
change interaction. The remarkable agreement between the
two confirms the effectiveness of Eq. (a) for high-Q energy
barriers. Owing to the invariance of the exchange interac-
tion under global spin rotations, this rule applies equally to
skyrmions and bimerons. Deviations may arise from slightly
different saddle point (SP) structures and from the interplay
with interactions that have been neglected in this model.

Besides the exchange, the DMI specifically stabilizes Q =
—1 skyrmions, while it has little effect on skyrmions with
Q4#-1 (SM Sec. S6 [27]). Consequently, the DMI
raises the barriers for Q = —1 but lowers them for Q = —2
skyrmions, as Q = —1 states have lower DMI energy and
can form via the collapse of Q = —2 skyrmions. Similar but
weaker effects occur for bimerons and antibimerons, which
also feature DMI-favored regions. By contrast, the MAE

for |Q| > 2 solitons (SM Sec. S6 [27]).

In addition to the energy barrier, the soliton lifetime is also
determined by entropic and dynamical aspects of the collapse

exponential factor [ of the Arrhenius law

We plot in Fig. Bla) the dependence of [9 on Q. The
bimeron with Q = +3 exhibits a smaller Io than low-
Q bimerons, indicating enhanced stability, while high-Q
skyrmions remain entropically unfavored, as reflected by
higher ['p. To elucidate the origin of this behavior, we decom-
pose the main contributing terms in Eq. (5) into the dynamical
prefactor, the harmonic mode within the harmonic approxi-
mation, and the zero-mode. Their respective dependences on
Q are displayed in Fig. [3[b-d). The values of A remain nearly
constant across different solitons, suggesting that its impact
on the Q-dependence of lifetimes is minor.

The harmonic contribution J Ha/H:, with Hx =

Tx isks AS and Hy = Te se Ai, generally leads to a
larger I’ for high-Q states (Fig. Blo). The only exception to
this rule is bimeron states with Q = +3. For these states,
we find an exceptionally low eigenvalue for the 3-fold distor-
tion mode, which is responsible for the comparably low values
seen in Fig. BJ). Arising from coinciding lattice- and soliton
geometry, this means that bimerons with Q = +3 are entropi-
cally stabilized by the C3-symmetry of the honeycomb lattice.
However, overall, the harmonic term disfavors high-Q states.

In contrast, the zero-mode contribution Z; /Za, with 44 =
Tk i and Z, = Tr, LA, effectively reduces Io for

i=l “i>
high-Q bimerons, while it shows only a minor Q-dependence
for skyrmions (Fig. Byd)). To clarify this difference, we ana-
lyze the zero mode contribution in the following.

Typically, a 2D soliton possesses two translational zero
modes (tra) and, if rotational symmetry is broken, additional
rotational zero modes (rot) [ . In this regard, the Q =
—1 skyrmion is special, because the rotational mode vanishes
due to its radial symmetry. For skyrmions and antiskyrmions
with Q # —1, the length L,o of a single rotation around the
soliton center, at radial distance p = 0, is directly linked to a
rotation of its helicity with Lye by

Lrot(0) = |Q + 1|Lnei , (6)

as illustrated in the inset of Fig. BU).

However, this relation does not hold at the SP. In this work,
all SP exhibit a Bloch point (BP) [35], a local discontinuity in
the magnetization where the topological charge changes sign.
The motion of the BP incurs a substantial energy cost on the
honeycomb lattice, rendering the translational mode nonzero,
and its contribution LA, appear only in the denominator of
. thereby reducing I'p and enhancing entropic stabiliza-
tion at large Q (Fig. Ble-f). Moreover, high-Q solitons tend
to collapse via a chimera-like pathway (see Anima-
tions 3 and 4, and Sec. S7 of the SM , which breaks
rotational symmetry and thereby makes the helicity mode
nonzero. In this situation, we find that the length L,.,(BP)
of a rotation around the BP, at distance pgp from the soliton
center, always holds (SM Sec. $1 [27])

tion by the contribution of translation modes. For bimerons
however, the fundamental asymmetry from Eq. (3) does not
apply (cf. Fig. Ble», leaving a ratio Li, (BP)/LA, x 1.
Therefore, high-@ bimerons are more entropically favored
than high-Q skyrmions, due to their distinct magnetic texture
symmetries.

ture ([_ ~ 10 K), 7 increases with |Q| for both bimerons
and skyrmions, rising by around 3 orders of magnitude for
bimerons (|Q| = 1 to 3) and up to 4 for antiskyrmions.
This enhancement of the lifetime at low temperatures is gov-
erned by AE. However, entropy becomes the dominant fac-
tor when extrapolated to room temperature (RT). As shown in
Fig. lo. 7 for |Q| = 3 bimerons remains higher than that
of low-Q counterparts near RT, whereas skyrmion lifetimes
decrease significantly with |Q| (Fig. ya). These opposite
trends arise from the fundamental difference between high-
Q bimerons and skyrmions, namely the entropy-dominated
lifetime of high-Q bimerons. For comparison, we also plot
the lifetime of Pd/Fe/Ir(111) [22], an ultrathin-film system
known for hosting nanoscale skyrmions with long lifetimes
(5) (24). Surprisingly, owing to the relatively flat T-T curves,
the |Q| = 1 solitons in our material exhibit even longer life-
times than those in Pd/Fe/Ir(111) at RT. In particular, for high-
Q bimerons, the lifetime can be further enhanced, highlight-
ing their potential for device applications.

In summary, we propose that high-Q bimerons provide
a more promising platform for spintronic applications than
high-Q skyrmions. To obtain realistic results, we chose an
experimentally feasible FGT/CGT interface as our model sys-
tem, in which we demonstrate the coexistence of high-Q
bimerons and antibimerons with arbitrary Q. We further
show that the lifetimes of high-Q bimerons differ fundamen-
tally from those of high-Q skyrmions due to differences in
their distinct rotational symmetries, leading to enhanced en-
tropic stability. In combination with the tendency of high-Q
bimerons to form superstructures — chains or rings — exhibit-
ing a high degree of nonlinear soliton-soliton interactions,
we argue that they hold great potential for neuromorphic and
stochastic spintronic devices [37] or quantum computing [38}.
All of our predictions can be experimentally tested using, for
example, spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy
or magnetic force microscopy [B9J.
