Abstract. We derive a formulation of the First Law of nonequilibrium
thermodynamics for biological information-processing systems by par-
titioning entropy in the Second Law into microscopic and mesoscopic
components and by assuming that natural selection promotes optimal in-
formation processing and transmission. The resulting framework demon-
strates how mesoscopic information-based subsystems can attain non-
equilibrium steady states (NESS) sustained by external energy and en-
tropy fluxes, such as those generated by ATP/ADP imbalances in vivo.
Moreover, mesoscopic systems may reach NESS before microscopic sub-
systems, leading to ordered structures in entropy flow analogous to eddies
in a moving stream.

1 Introduction

The universe is subject to the Second Law of Thermodynamics and is irreversibly
moving toward heat death, a state of maximal disorder in which information and
structure vanish [15]. However, within this trajectory toward uniformity, life has
emerged as a striking counterexample: an organized, information-processing phe-
nomenon inseparably embedded in a turbulent physical environment. To persist,
iving systems must continually adapt, and adaptation depends on the acquisi-
ion, transmission, and transformation of information. In this sense, biology can
be understood as a form of computation.

At the molecular scale, this computation is carried out by regulatory pro-
cesses that function analogously to switches [8, 9, 6]. These mechanisms, fueled
by external energy sources such as sunlight or nutrient-derived metabolites, gov-
ern cellular behavior through precise biochemical reactions. The phosphoryla-
ion/dephosphorylation cycle (PdPC) (see Figure 1) exemplifies this mechanism
14]. These reversible reactions, typically occurring in amino acids within pro-
eins, act as decision points that direct cellular outcomes under a wide range
of conditions. Other classes of molecular switches are widespread, yet share the

defining characteristics of this cycle [14]. Through their collective action, molec-
ular switches dynamically regulate physiological functions, including immune
responses, behavior, and metabolism. Life’s adaptability thus emerges from the
orchestrated interplay of countless such reactions, which continuously compute
and recalibrate biological information.

Typically, energy input is required to phosphorylate an amino acid. ATP imbalance
drives the energy Ep of the dephosphorylated state to the higher energy Ep of the
phosphorylated state. The switch lives in a protein matrix that, through conforma-
tional changes, alter the energy relations between phosphorylated and dephosphory-
lated states. Whether a site is phosphorylated or not can determine intracellular re-
sponse to the switch state.

From a broader perspective, life represents a process by which order is carved
rom thermodynamic chaos. By coarse-graining innumerable microscopic states
into stable functional patterns shaped by natural selection, biological systems
maintain complexity despite entropic pressures. Sustained by external energy
fluxes within an otherwise equilibrating universe, these systems manipulate in-
‘ormation to create mesostates (nanometer length scale) that respond flexibly
o environmental stimuli. In this way, life persists as a transient but resilient is-
and of order, demonstrating how matter and energy can generate computational
architectures capable of resisting the universal drift toward randomness.
Simple molecular switches, such as those illustrated in Figure 1, lend them-
selves to analysis using statistical-physics methods similar to those described in
he monograph by Seifert [16]. Here, we apply statistical physics to a biological
information-processing system immersed in a thermal bath and coupled to a pro-
ein matrix capable of modulating the switch’s energy levels. By incorporating
Shannon’s concept of mutual information [17] into the Second Law of Thermo-
dynamics, we show that such systems can maintain functionality over extended
imescales and operate at an extremum of information processing. This perspec-

tive further suggests a generalization of the First Law of Thermodynamics in
which information itself contributes to the generation of heat.

This study complements a parallel investigation [7] that derives the statisti-
cal ensemble for biological switches powered by dedicated energy sources. That
framework, termed the Biological Ensemble, generalizes the Gibbs ensemble to
describe open biological systems and shows that such switches can occupy qua-
sistable states corresponding to on, off, and inactive configurations.

2 The Model Switch

2.1 Microstates and Mesostates

The model switch considered here, exemplified by the phosphorylation / dephos-
phorylation cycle (PdPC) shown in Figure 1, consists of atoms and molecules
whose precise configuration at any instant defines a microstate « € X, where
X is the set of all possible microstates. The task of statistical mechanics is to
determine the probability of a given microstate x based on mesoscopic knowl-
edge of the system and externally imposed constraints. In equilibrium statistical
mechanics, this is accomplished by the Canonical Ensemble [15], from which the
laws of equilibrium thermodynamics follow. In that case, the average energy of
the microstates defines the temperature as a fundamental mesoscopic variable.
From a functional perspective, the switch is described by a mesostate y,
where y = (1,0) denotes the dephosphorylated form and y = (0,1) denotes the
phosphorylated form. Each mesostate comprises many underlying microstates;
for example, numerous microscopic configurations are consistent with phospho-
rylation. Thus, the space of microstates can be partitioned according to their
associated mesostates, and each mesostate y is assigned a probability Pr(y). A
rigorous treatment of these ideas is given in [11] and [12].
The switch is embedded in a thermal bath of temperature T and within a
protein matrix whose configurations, determined by ligand binding, modulate
the phosphorylation state. Both the bath and the protein matrix can themselves
be described in terms of micro- and mesostates. Together, these components
make up a mesoscopic information system that must be stable, programmable,
and capable of transmitting information to other systems that generate biological
outcomes. The heat bath mediates thermal exchange with this system.
Switches dissipate heat when they cycle through on and off states [10], and
functional information processing requires the input of external energy. The fact

that information generates heat upon its erasure is known as Landauer’s Prin-
ciple [2].

For the PdPC, this energy is supplied by a nonequilibrium chemical flux
J arising from imbalances in ATP and ADP concentrations, though other nu-
cleotides may play similar roles in different systems. Unlike equilibrium sys-
tems, biological information-processing systems are open and constrained by
such fluxes, rendering the Canonical Ensemble of equilibrium thermodynamics
inapplicable. Instead, the recently proposed Biological Ensemble [7] generalizes
4 R. Jones, A. Giacometti, A. Jones

the Canonical Ensemble to these open systems, yielding thermodynamic conse-
quences distinct from those of equilibrium ensembles, including explicit treat-
ment of heat dissipation from information processing [10].

2.2 Natural Selection and Information

We postulate that natural selection favors genetic architectures that enhance the
efficiency of information processing and transformation. This efficiency improves
the ability of organisms to adapt to fluctuating environments, thereby prolonging
survival and increasing the persistence of genetic material across generations.
For single switch, this postulate leads to the observation that the switch can
exist in up to three quasistable states for any specific values of the phosphate
bonding energy [7]. This behavior has been observed in impedance measurements
of photo-active ligands interacting with transmembrane receptors [18].

We adopt Shannon’s mutual information [17] as a natural measure of biolog-
ical information, since it follows from five fundamental axioms: non-negativity,
symmetry, chain rule, data processing inequality, and additivity [3]. Relaxing one
or more of these axioms produces alternative measures, but Shannon’s formula-
tion remains the most widely applicable. For a mesoscopic system that transmits
information from one storage state y € Y to another y’ € Y, the transferred in-
formation In, is given by

Pr(y,y')

IM = P i —————_ 1

w= >o YS Pr(yy’) n(n (1)
yey y/EY

where Pr(y) and Pr(y’) denote the probabilities of the respective mesostates

and Pr(y,y’) the joint probability distribution. For a switch such as the PdPC
(Figure 1), the set of mesostates can be written as

Y =(d,p), pe€(0,1), de (0,1) (2)

where d represents the dephosphorylated state and p the phosphorylated state.
If natural selection acts to maximize information processing efficiency, the
principle can be formalized as

dIy > 0, (3)

implying that evolutionary dynamics preserve or increase the mutual information
transmitted by biological switches.

2.3 Second Law of Thermodynamics

The path toward thermodynamics of biological systems proceeds through the
Second Law of Thermodynamics, which holds in both equilibrium and nonequi-
librium regimes. Adopting Jaynes’ informational formulation of entropy in the
Second Law [5], we derive a corresponding First Law that describes the flow of
energy among information, work, and the thermal bath.

set X of microstates x € X is (see [5])

where Pr(x) is the probability that microstate x occurs.
The Second Law of Thermodynamics can be stated as

dS >0 (5)

The fact that information processing generates heat implies that when the in-
formation of a mesosystem increases, the entropy of the microstates increases.
The entropy can then be restated as

S=Sm —In (6)

where S,, is the entropy of microscopic states reduced by the degrees of freedom
lost to the constraints on the information Jy,.

The minus sign in Equation 6 is chosen in order to be consistent with Landauer’s
Principle. Incorporation of finite information Ij, in Equation 7 into microscopic
entropy Si increases the entropy in microscopic states. This is a consequence of
the non-negativity of information flow Iy,.

The Second Law becomes [13, 16]

dS = diy — dIy > 0 (8)

and

dSm = dIu (9)
which states that the heating of the microstates is faster or as fast as information
is generated. Equation 7 defines the entropy for the microstates in the presence
of controlled mesoscopic information Iy,.

2.4 Creation and Maintenance of Information

Mesoscopic information I,, is generated and maintained by externally driven
chemical flux J. This flux can be expressed in terms of probability flow as

J = Pr(yly’) Pr(y’) = Pr(y'|y) Pr(y) = Pr(y. 9’) (10)

where Pr(yly’) and Pr(y’|y) are the transition probabilities between the
mesostates y and y’. In steady state, the forward flux from y’ to y is equal
to the reverse flux from y to y’. For y # y’, Equation 10 is Bayes theorem with
J = Pr(y,y’) [4]. This implies that the information can be completely specified

Pr(y’). We can think of J as an externally deter-

ake this quantity as given by external conditions.

It is important to note that Equation 10 does not imply microscopic re-
versibility of the mesosystem. The system need not follow the same trajectory in

First Law of Thermodynamics

In the absence of work exchanged with the external environment, the First Law
of Thermodynamics can be written using the Clausius relation between energy

and entropy as [15]

which, for constant temperature and pressure, becomes

B=U+pV -TSm =H-TSp, (14)
— Sm dT — Tdly + dW (15)
dB =—T dIy + dw (16)

which shows that maximization of mesoscopic information Ij, in the absence
of external work on the mesosystem corresponds to minimization of Biological
Thermodynamics of Biological Switches at

Free Energy B. This condition is achieved when the mesoscopic system reaches
a NESS (dI)¢ = 0, dW = 0), which may occur well before the total entropy is
maximized. The timescales of entropy maximization in the universe are much
longer than the timescales of natural selection.

The molecular switches reside within proteins capable of performing mechan-
ical work dW on the switches through conformational changes in their tertiary
structure. These conformational transitions are typically triggered by the binding
and dissociation of ligands, coupling the chemical free energy to information pro-
cessing within the protein. Consequently, the protein conformation determines
or at least modulates the information content of the switch. The formation of a
switch is influenced by the work generated as the protein matrix changes con-
formation, while the erasure of information is accompanied by the dissipation
of heat into the surrounding microstates, consistent with Landauer’s Principle
[2]. Thus, the creation and maintenance of mesoscopic information represent a
dynamic partnership between the external flux J, which drives energy through
the mesosystem, and the mechanical work performed by the protein matrix on
the information-bearing components. This framework unites thermodynamic,
informational, and biological perspectives on cellular regulation.

Together, Equations 7, 14, and 16 generalize the Gibbs free energy from
equilibrium systems to biological switches operating in NESS.

4 Discussion

In biological information-processing systems, energy and entropy can be parti-
ioned into microscopic and mesoscopic components. Introducing the concept
of Biological Free Energy demonstrates that its minimization corresponds to
he maximization of mesoscopic information. This condition defines a nonequi-
ibrium steady state (NESS), which can be established well before total en-
ropy is maximized. In this way, the framework generalizes the Gibbs free en-
ergy—traditionally restricted to equilibrium—to describe the dynamics of bio-
ogical switches operating far from equilibrium.

Building on the separation of entropy in the Second Law, and assuming
hat natural selection favors optimal information processing and transmission,
we derived expressions for the First Law of nonequilibrium thermodynamics in
biological information systems (Equations 14, 16, and 7). The analysis assumes
hermal equilibrium at the level of microstates, while mesoscopic states remain
out of chemical equilibrium.
The mesoscopic information-processing subsystem reaches a NESS driven by
external energy fluxes, such as ATP/ADP cycling. This steady state can emerge
rior to microscopic equilibrium, generating structured entropy flows analogous
o eddies in a moving fluid. On evolutionary timescales, life itself can be viewed
as a persistent nonequilibrium phenomenon, sustained far from thermodynamic
equilibrium long before universal entropy reaches its maximum.

It is important to emphasize that the present treatment does not require
mesoscale information systems to be microscopically reversible, nor are the
8 R. Jones, A. Giacometti, A. Jones

mesostates of biological switches assumed to be in or near thermal equilibrium,
although the surrounding heat bath is considered equilibrated. The only require-
ment is that the switch operates in an NESS, where the information is located
at an extremum.
The absence of microscopic reversibility implies that phosphorylation and
dephosphorylation proceed along distinct reaction pathways, a necessity in vivo,
where kinases catalyze phosphorylation and phosphatases drive dephosphoryla-
tion. Consequently, these reactions are thermodynamically coupled yet mechanis-
tically distinct. The informational mesosystem thus functions far from thermo-
chemical equilibrium. The probability distributions of switch states differ quali-
tatively from those of equilibrium systems; for a given phosphate-bonding energy,
the system may occupy up to three quasistable states, in contrast to the single
state permitted under equilibrium conditions [7].
The model of a biological switch regulated by a measurable chemical flux
J can be generalized to systems in which both total energy input and heat
output are characterized by Q = Jq, where Q represents the total rate of energy
input from ATP hydrolysis and g denotes the heat dissipated per switching cycle
between on and off states. In networks of multiple switches, variations in heat
dissipation among individual elements may determine the sequence of activation.
Such thermodynamic coupling likely plays a critical role in switch regulation and
will be explored further through combined theoretical and experimental studies.
Historically, stochastic thermodynamics [13, 16] has addressed the resolution
Loschmidt’s paradox, which questions the compatibility of microscopic re-
ersibility with the Second Law of Thermodynamics [1]. The time dependence
of transient relaxation on a steady state, typically assumed to be equilibrium,
has been central to this effort, leading to fluctuation theorems that describe the
mesoscopic nature of these transients [19].
In contrast, the present treatment does not restrict the steady state to equi-
ibrium; instead, it explicitly requires a NESS. Furthermore, we do not address
the transient approach to NESS. The relevant notion of reversibility here is not
microscopic, but logical reversibility [2]. If no work is performed on the mesosys-
tem (dW = 0) by the surrounding protein matrix, then NESS requires that no
change occurs in the information content of the mesosystem (dIjz = 0). This
condition implies that the mesosystem is logically reversible, though not neces-
sarily microscopically reversible.
The PdPC model developed here can easily be generalized to a wide range
of biological switches, including networks of multiple interacting switches and
information systems operating under diverse constraints. The entropy change
of the microscopic states may differ across mesoscopic configurations, reflecting
the dependence of molecular dynamics on higher-level organization. Transitions
between on and off states can occur through conformational changes in the
surrounding protein matrix, which functions as an external constraint shaping
the accessible mesostates.
