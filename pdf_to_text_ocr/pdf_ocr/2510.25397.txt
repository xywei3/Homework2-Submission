Highly damped Quasi-Normal Modes of a Loop Quantum Black Hole

Clara Montagnon' []
‘Univ Lyon, ENS de Lyon, CNRS, Laboratoire de Physique, F-69342 Lyon, France

We compute asymptotic Quasi-Normal Mode (QNM) frequencies — i.e. frequencies with a very
large Imaginary part — of a Loop Quantum Gravity inspired Black Hole. The deformations from
the Schwarzschild Black Hole are encoded via two parameters: the minimal area gap ao and the
polymeric deformation parameter P. In this study, we focus on the effect of the latter one, P, on the
highly-damped part of QNM spectra. We consider both spin 0 and spin 2 test-field perturbations
on the Black Hole as proper gravitational perturbations cannot be performed on an effective model.

We use an analytical method of computation of QNMs referred to as the monodromy technique,
which allows us to compute the asymptotic behaviour of QNMs. We found interesting oscillating
behaviour in both the Real part and the Imaginary part of the QNMs, where the oscillation period
varies with the polymeric deformation parameter P. We compare these analytical predictions to
numerical results obtained thanks to the Continued fraction method. Even though the latter does
not converge for QNMs with a very large Imaginary part, the numerical results are in rather good
agreement with the monodromy prediction.

INTRODUCTION

Until now, the theoretical predictions extracted from General Relativity are correctly matching and explaining every
experimental result. We can mention for example the dynamics of the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar system [1] [2], the
cosmological observations of the PLANCK collaboration [3] and the detection of Gravitational Waves (GWs) a decade

ago [4]. The waves were emitted during the merger of

We will start by reminding the geometry of the Modesto BH in the subcase ap = 0, before giving the equations for
scalar and gravitational test-field perturbations. Our work on the BCL BH [30] demonstrated that spin 2 test-field
QNMs can be very different from the physical gravitational ones, especially in the highly-damped regime. Our findings
regarding gravitational test-field perturbations are therefore not intended to make physical predictions, but rather
constitute a theoretical mathematical study. We will then apply the Continued fraction method to these cases, along

with the Monodromy technique. The results arising from both computations accompanied by comparisons will be
given in section [V]

I. EFFECTIVE LOOP QUANTUM BLACK WITH SIMPLIFIED GEOMETRY

As mention before, we will restrict to the case ap = 0 for two reasons. First, ap is the scaled version of LQG’s area
gap A: ag = A/8 — which corresponds to the smallest quantum of area predicted by LQG and is thus expected
to be of Planck order —. It is then natural to neglect it. This is especially justified by our previous analysis, which
showed that ag had to be larger than 10~? to induce a significant deviation on the QNMs spectrum. Moreover, the
structure of the elements involved in the monodromy computation make the procedure more involved as we explain
in appendix [B} and we have not been able to pursuit it.

We recall that r, corresponds to the outer event horizon radius (reducing to the Schwarzschild radius r, in the
Schwarzschild limit), while r_ is an inner Cauchy radius (vanishing in the Schwarzschild limit). They are related to

and where 6 is called the polymeric parameter. It is an adimensional effective parameter which is a priori resulting
from the coarse-graining of the fundamental Planck scale dynamics. It is then a free parameter and it has been
constrained as we mentioned earlier [27}29]: 5 < 0.67 at 95% level, hence the constraint on the polymeric function
P < 6.17 x 107%. We will consider values larger than this bound for our study, willing to explore the new structures
and symmetries arising in the hole range of possible values for P. We will then consider 0 < P < 1, as 1 is an natural
upper-bound imposed by its definition.

II. SCALAR AND GRAVITATIONAL TEST-FIELD PERTURBATIONS

The Modesto BH being an effective BH model derived from LQG concepts, proper metric perturbations cannot
be performed as there is not any equivalent of the Einstein equations available for the description of the modified
dynamics. As an alternative, we choose to study spin 0 and 2 test-field perturbations with the aim of analysing the
deformations arising from the modifications of the BH model. As mentioned before, the spin 2 test-field perturbations
do not take into account the modified dynamics from LQG, yet we study them as a mathematical toy with the aim
of getting a better understanding of the structure of QNM spectra exhibiting deformations.

Given that the Modesto BH is a static and spherically symmetric metric, we can directly use the master equation
for the field function U(r)
where the effective potentials V(r) are given by the general formulas for scalar and test-field spin 2 perturbations —
which can be found in the paper [31] — applied to the metric functions (2h:

The angular-momentum contribution is given by the parameter A = ¢(¢+ 1) and the Schwarzschild limit is recovered
by taking P = 0. The tortoise coordinate x used to cast the master equation describing the perturbations dynamic

Finally, we can learn a lot at the behaviour of the spin 0 and 2 test-field potentials by plotting them for different
values of the polymeric function P (we choose to span P from 0 to 0.8), with respect to the radial coordinate r. The

with the radial location of the maxima of the effective potential, while the height of the latter is largely increased.

Ill. CONTINUED FRACTION METHOD

Let us now apply the Continued fraction method developed by Leaver [32] by first building an ansatz for the test-
field function U(r) which obeys the physically motivated boundary conditions for QNMs. As we saw in the previous
section, the effective potentials vanish both at the horizon r; and at infinity. Due to the specific shape of the master
equation, the asymptotic behaviour of the field function W will then be plane-waves in the tortoise coordinate x. We
on

can therefore take a look at the asymptotic first order behaviour of the tortoise coordinate x at the horizon r; and
at infinity:

c=r+(r_try)log(r)+O(1), (r > 0). (9b)

+O(1), (r>r4), (9a)

Knowing that QNMs are required to be ingoing only at the BH event horizon and outgoing only at infinity, we can
write the asymptotic behaviour of the field function WV in terms of the radial coordinate r:

Tren (r— 4) a, (r>r4), (10a)
Wn elt wn er 4 pivlr—+r4) (r > 00). (10b)

Following Leaver’s method [32], we can now formulate an ansatz for the field function © describing the scalar and
gravitational test-field perturbations, in term of a power series in the variable a i

<a

( ) iia (tort ta r—T,\"
U(r) = TPH (p — p_ iol : W

n=0

In order for this ansatz to be physically well defined, the power series need to respect some conditions. First, we have
to require ag # 0 and a, = 0 for n < 0 to ensure the QNM boundary condition at horizon. Second, the series }7 a,
must be convergent in order for the ansatz to have a correct behaviour at infinity.

Plugging this ansatz into the second-order differential master equation with the effective potentials Vo(r) and V2(r)
yields recursion equations that must be satisfied by the coefficients ay:

The five coefficients Qn, 8n, In, On, €n are all quadratic polynomials in n. They also depend on the polymeric defor-
mation function P, the frequency w and the angular momentum parameter 2.
They read explicitly for spin s = 0:

In order to apply Leaver’s method, we first need to reduce this five-terms recurrence relation into a three-terms one
which will be cast-able in a continued fraction equation. To this end, we apply a two steps Gaussian reduction. It
first consists in defining four new recursion coefficients such that

n-1 7 Bn-1 a
En In = In — F Ens bn = Sn
n—1 nm—1 nm—1

Gn =On, Bn =Bn

Si]

The five-terms recursion relation is then equivalent to a four-terms recursion relation in these new coefficients:

GnOnt1 + Bran + Fndn—1 + Ondn—2 = 0. (16)

The same procedure can be applied a second time to define three new recursion coefficients

= ane a a a -1l<¢ = = Pn-1¢s
Gn =@n, Bn =Bn-=—bn, An =n - = —On; (17)

Yn-1 Yn-1

such that we end up with a three-term recursion relation:

Gindngt + Bntn + Fn@n—1 = 0. (18)

The Gaussian procedure is pretty involved. It is therefore not possible to extract analytical expressions of the three
final coefficients and the latter then have to be computed numerically for each choice of the parameters. The three-
terms recurrence relation finally allows to follow Leaver’s procedure by transforming it into a continued fraction
equation:

(19)

The QNMs can then be found by computing the roots of this equation and its inversions.

Iv. ANALYTICAL COMPUTATION OF THE ASYMPTOTIC QNMS USING THE MONODROMY
TECHNIQUE

It is known that, for the Schwarzschild BH, the Real part of the QNM frequencies converges towards the constant
value (In 3)/4m while the gap in Imaginary part between two succeeding QNMs converges towards 3:

4nr.w =In(3) —i(2n+1)7, neN. (20)

This asymptotic behaviour was probed numerically by Nollert [33] before being derived analytically by Molt [34].
The gap between the QNMs imaginary parts is supposed to probe the deep quantum regime of BHs. One can see
({19) [34}{37]) for reviews. Here, we want to use the same analytical technique of computation which was used to
determine (20), referred as the monodromy technique, to probe the asymptotic of the test-field QNM spectrum of
the Modesto BH and see how the parameter P impacts it.

Let us consider the master equation for spin 0 and 2 test-field perturbations of the Modesto BH, considering ap = 0:

where the quantities r+, r_, ro are given in terms of the polymeric deformation function P:

The key point of the monodromy technique is to extend the usual physical domain of definition ry. <r < oo to
the whole complex plane. Then, the equation (21) is an ordinary differential equation with regular singular points at
r=0,r=r4,r=r-— and an irregular singular point at r = oo. Thus, any solution from in the physical region
extends to the complex plane, but may be multivalued around the singular points.

Let us first take a look at infinity. As the effective potential (22b) vanishes at infinity, the wave-function V has a
plane-wave behaviour:

W(x) © Aye’? + A_e (24)

The boundary condition for QNMs at infinity, stating that the wave must be outgoing at infinity, implies AL = 0
and then ®(x) © Aye.

Now let us consider the behaviour of the wave-function WV around the singularity r = 0. At first order, the effective

potentials (22b) reduces to

Ps Loa, (25)

V,(r) ~ [A+ 2(s— 1)] (1+ P)§r6 :

It is important to notice that this potential vanishes when taking P to 0 and that we do not recover the first
order Schwarzschild potential VS) at comer which is the one considered in the monodromy technique for the
Schwarzschild BH. As we shall see later, this will result in the lack of a well defined limit P —> 0 for the monodromy
result and its prediction is then expected to be less accurate for small P. One would need to go beyond the first order
to overcome this issue.

The first order of the tortoise coordinate around the singularity r = 0 write

Notice once again that the limit P —-> 0 is not well defined.
The first order effective potential can then be written as a function of x:
A+2(s—-1
Va(2) = et Be a (27)

9x?
The equation for spin 0 and 2 test-field perturbations around the Modesto BH can thus be simplified around
r=Oas

ew? ( _ #25 = 1) U=0. (28)

dx 9x?

It is convenient to rescale the x-coordinate into z = wx and introduce the function ® such that U(x) = ®(wx) V2mw2.
This function now satisfies a straightforward Bessel equation:
‘ , ‘ V4\ +8541
2O2® + 20,8 + (2? —v?) & =0, with v= —_—. (29)
Thus the general solution of equation (28) for the wave function U(x) around the singularity r = 0 can be written in
terms of Bessel functions of the first kind J4,:

U(r)" By V2rwe J,(wr) + B_V2mwx J_,(wx) (30)

The next thing we want to do is matching this solution with the solution at infinity U(x) ~ A,e*. In this section
we are interested in the study of the asymptotic part of the QNM spectrum. Whereas considering the Schwarzschild
BH or the Modesto BH from LQG, one see that going through the spectrum the absolute value of the imaginary part
of the QNMs |Im(w)| soon becomes way larger than the real part Re(w). In the asymptotic part of the spectrum,
we can then consider w to be very large and purely imaginary. We will stick to this hypothesis throughout all the
computation.

We can now use the following expansion of the Bessel functions

e 2
dy) com 4/ = cos (: _ > - *) ; (31)

and apply it to the solution around r = 0 for |wa| > 1:

U(x) ee 2B, cos (we ao *) + 2B_ cos (ox 4 ee *) , (32a)
2 4 2 4
<> W(x) lwn|>1 (Brent if: B_e-i*-) ive 4 (Byeie* + B_e'*-) enter (32b)

with ay = $(1+2v).

In order to match the solutions at infinity and around r = 0, none of the exponentials e should dominate each
other. The matching with the solution at infinity must then be done following the Stokes lines, defined such that a
is purely imaginary and then such that wa € R. The Stokes lines are represented in black in the complex r-plane
of figure 2] For the calculation of the QNMs frequencies we will follow the red contour, starting at point B where
Re(wa) > 0. Indeed, we have Im(w) < 0 as we use the convention e~”¢ for the time evolution, along with Im(z) being
positive at point B. As wa > 1 at point B, we can use the solution (32b) and apply the QNM boundary condition
at infinity, i.e. the condition that the wave must be outgoing at infinity. This give us a first condition:

tiwa

By,ei*+ + B_e'*- =0, (33)

and we are left with the following solution for the wave function U(x)

(a) wa>l (Bye“**+ + B_e#2-) ive (34)
In order to rotate from the branch containing the point B to the next one (where the lobe is located), we need to
rotate by an angle -% in the complex r-plane. From equation , one can see that this is equivalent to rotate by

angle —27 in the a-plane. Let us apply this to our solution, using the asymptotic expansion for the Bessel function
under a —27 rotation:

Vine we Jay (er wa) = eH) /Orwe Jy (wex) (35a)
~ 2e~*#% cos(wa — a4). (35b)
The solution on this branch can then be written as:
(ar) ~ 2B, 7+ cos(wx — a4) + 2B_e7*"*- cos(wa — a_) (36a)
= (Bye 30+ + B_e 3!e- jer + (Bye a+ -f B_e754- Jee, (36b)
a

FIG. 2: Contour for the calculation of QNM frequencies in the complex r plane. The different colour regions
are separated by the associated Stokes lines and the dark blue region corresponds to Re(x) > 0.

One can see that the behaviour is purely oscillatory. Then following the contour around the lobe circling the inner
horizon r_, one travels an additional distance which corresponds to the distance 6 in the z-plane such that:

fie

6 = —2ni (37)

rer

The solution for V after travelling around the inner horizon r_ can then be written using Bessel functions as in (36b),
and taking into account the additional travel distance 6 leads to:

W(x)” Cy /2nw(@ — 5) J, (w(x — 5)) + B_\/2mw(@ — 5) J_, (w(x — 4) (38)

As w(x — 6) is negative on this branch, one has to use the asymptotic expansion

so that the solution can be expressed as
W(x) ~ 2C, cos [w(x — 6) + a4] + 2C_ cos [w(a — 6) + a_] (40a)

This solution must be matching with the solution (36b) we found for V before going around the lobe circling the inner

The next step is to do a last rotation to the branch containing the point A by rotating (x — 6) through an angle of

such that the solution on the branch containing the point A reads

W(x) ~ 20,67 "+ cos [w(x — 5) + a4] + 2C_e7-"°~ cos [w(x — 6) + a_] (43a)

Finally, let us close the contour around r ~ ov, following the red line, where x ~ r and Re(x) > 0. As Im(w) < 0,
the factor e~‘“” is exponentially small on this part of the contour, so that only the coefficient of e’”” should be taken
into account for the calculation. After having completed the red contour, the coefficient e“*” is then multiplied by

One can distort the contour without any impact on the monodromy value, as long as the distortion does not cross
any singularity. Let us then take a contour simply circling the BH event horizon being r,. This contour is drawn in
figure |2]as the small green circle. As the effective potentials vanish around the horizon r+, the wave-function
W has a plane-wave shape:

We can apply the QNM boundary condition at the horizon, stating that the wave must be ingoing. This implies

These solutions w of this equation then give asymptotic QNMs, with proper behaviour at infinity and at the horizon.
This equation does not give an explicit expression for the frequencies w in terms of the mode number, as it was the
case for the Schwarzshild BH. Here, one has to numerically solve this equation on the complex plane in order to obtain
the asymptotic QNMs. The results will be given in the following section.

As one can notice, this equation does not reduce to the one for the Schwarzschild BH and instead yields in the
limit r_ — 0:

e+ +34 Acos(2mv) = 0. (56)

This can be explained by the fact that the first order term of the effective potentials ( ) around r = 0 vanish. The
same issue occurs with the tortoise coordinate x (26), changing the topology of the Stokes lines. The limit r_ > 0
(P — 0) is then not well defined and we expect the monodromy formula to be less accurate for small values of

P.,

Let us recall the general definition of v in terms of the spin s of the perturbation field and of the angular momentum
parameter ¢:

Vv. ANALYTICAL AND NUMERICAL RESULTS
A. Monodromy results

Let us start with the case of scalar perturbations, for which there exist two monodromy equations according to
the value of the angular momentum parameter (59). Indeed, all monodromy QNMs with ¢ = 1,4,7,10,... will have
vanishing real parts and an imaginary value determined by (60). On the contrary, the monodromy QNMs with
£ = 0,2,3,5,6,... will have non-trivial values. The numerical procedure for finding the roots of this equation is
straightforward, and we easily computed the QNMs frequencies up to |Im(w)| = 500.

The spectra for small deformations in P are displayed in figure[3] The spectrum for P = 0 corresponds to the first
order monodromy result of the Schwarzschild BH, and hence consists in a vertical line of real part equal to log(3)/4a
and an imaginary gap, defined as

Alm = Im(wn — Wn+1), (63)
13

of value 1/2. One can see that, as P is increased, the real parts and the imaginary gap both increase, but the spectrum
keeps a vertical shape, which is consistent with the results of our previous study [26]. In particular, one can see that
the monodromy predictions for the imaginary gap [3] are consistent with our previous observations [26] which were
based on a computation using the Continued fraction method. However, starting from about P = 0.15, one can see
that the spectrum line is curved. This is the premise of oscillations patterns in the QNM spectra, which appear more

and more clearly and intensely as P is large. One can note that, by continuity, the QNM spectra for 0 < P <1 must
display a crossing pattern close to infinity.

The QNM spectra for 0.2 < P < 0.9 are shown in figure [4]

One can see that the QNM spectra present strong oscillations patterns in the Real part, with an oscillation period
increasing as P enlarges. From P ~ 0.6, the QNM spectra become highly chaotic and only settle down to clear
oscillation patterns around P = 0.9, where they seem to tighten around one value. One can notice from equation
that the extremal case P ~ 1 will be characterised by QNMs with real part equal to Log(3)/47(r4 + r_) and
an imaginary gap reaching 1. There are then two extremal and singular cases — P = 0 (Schwarzschild) and P = 1
— which display the same type of behaviour: a constant real part equal to Log(3)/47(r4 + r_) (in the Schwarzchild
r_ = 0 andr; =r, = 1) and an imaginary gap respectfully equal to 1/2 and 1. In between these extremal
i.e for 0 < P <1, the real part of QNMs is oscillating between 0 and Log(5)/4a(r4 —r_) as one can see in

FIG. 5: Plots on the complex plane of the evolution of the imaginary gap Alm(w,,) in terms of the mode number
n for scalar modes computed via the monodromy technique. Five different values of P are represented, from
0.1 to 0.9.

It turns out that the gap in imaginary part also displays some oscillations patterns. Although it is not well visible
for the naked eye, it explains the chaotic spectra of P ~ 0.6 where both oscillations in the real part and in the
15

imaginary gap mix together. These oscillations patterns for the imaginary gap are represented in figure (a and one
can clearly see how AIm(w,,) goes from 1/2 (P = 0) to 1(P = 1).

Now, let us cover the case of spin s = 2 test-field perturbations. This time the final equation describing the QNMs
computed from the monodromy technique is more involved and depends on the angular momentum parameter ¢ via

the coefficient N(¢) = 1+ 2cos [ae l. Indeed, the equation can be written as:

2 2
anrdw anew

em +e = [14+ N(O] +N (0) =0, (64)

The QNM spectra will then be highly influenced by the value of \(¢), and in order to better understand this behaviour,
we can first take a look at the evolution of this coefficient. To do so, we plotted in figure [6] the coefficient N(£) for
0<<50.

FIG. 6: Plot of the coefficient N(¢) = 1+ 2cos [a] for 0 << 50.

One can see that the coefficient \/(¢) oscillates between -1 and 3. The integer values of ¢ are marked by a cross
and the corresponding values of N(¢) are distribute in an erratic way between -1 and 3. We recall that the values
£=0 and ¢ = 1 are not physically valid for spin 2 perturbations as the latter do not propagate in these cases. We are
then only interested in @ > 2. Although the values of N’(¢) seem erratic for small /, one can notice that they actually
converge for large & towards two different values: 2 and -1. In this limit, the equation reduces to two distinct
equations:

One can notice that these equations are the same than the ones for the spin 0 case. In the limit ¢ >> 1 the spin 2
QNM spectra predicted by the monodromy calculation will then be the same as the ones we described previously.
We can verify the behaviour at large ¢ of the coefficient V(0):

N(0) 2! 14 2008 ees *s] (66)

One can then notice that if @ can be written as = 1+ 3p, p € N ~ i.e. if its remainder when divided by 3 is 1 —, then
N(€) = 1+ 2cos[(1 + 2p)z] = —1. If it if not case, i.e. if the remainder of ¢ when divided by 3 is 0 or 2, then we
obtain that \V(¢) = 2. We therefore find ourselves in exactly the same situation as scalar perturbation for > 1.

FIG. 9: Plots on the complex plane of the QNMs values predicted by the monodromy calculation for spin s = 2
test field perturbations, = 40 and P = 0.1,0.5,0.9.

Let us start by @ = 2, the lowest possible value of ¢ for spin 2 perturbations. The QNM spectra for ¢ = 2 and
0.2 < P < 0.9 are shown in figure[7| One can see that the spectra are actually pretty similar from the ones we obtain
‘or scalar perturbations (see figure|4). The only notable difference lies in the amplitudes of the oscillations: one can
notice that the maxima have slightly different values.
The spectra show more variations as we increase ¢ nonetheless. We displayed the QNM spectra for = 3, 4, 5 and
or three values of P in figure [8] One can see that both the amplitude and the patterns of the oscillations change
depending on the value of ¢.
The QNM spectra will continue to differ when increasing the angular momentum parameter ¢ until we will reach the
imit ¢ >> 1 where either N(£) = 2 or N(¢) = —1. In the latter case, the real part of the QNMs predicted by the
monodromy calculation vanish and the QNMs are then purely damped. In order to gain an insight of the transition
o this limit, we can take a look at the case £ = 40 for which V(¢) = —1 as one can see on figure Gg The plots for
P =0.1, 0.5, 0.9 are shown in figure (9). One can see that the maximal amplitude of the real part is about 107? and
hat we are indeed in the midst of a transition towards Re(w) = 0.

We have not discussed the behaviour of the Imaginary gap for the case of spin 2 test-field perturbations. In short,
he amplitudes and the patterns of the oscillations will as well be diverse for small values of ¢, and will then either
settle to a constant imaginary gap (see equation (60) in the case N(£) = —1, or will behave as what we observed in
figure [5] in the case N(€) = 2.

B. Continued fraction results

In this section we will now present our results from the Continued fraction method and directly compare them the
ones we obtained from the monodromy method.
For the scalar perturbations, we show in figure [10] five plots of QNM spectra for ¢ = 0 and five different values of
P between 0.1 and 0.9. The QNMs computed with Leaver’s method are shown in blue while the ones computed via
the monodromy technique are represented in green. One can first notice that the larger P is and the more oscillation
patterns there are, the less number of QNMs we were able to compute via the Continued fraction method. While
we could easily compute QNMs with |Im(w)| 2 100 for P ~ 0.1, we could only reach |Im(w)| ~ 20 for P 2 0.7.
However, one can see that the monodromy and the Leaver spectra show very similar behaviour for each value of P.
In particular, for P = 0.3, the values of both types of QNMs seem to be getting closer and closer as their imaginary
part increases. For P = 0.1, we find ourselves in the classic case of vertical asymptote and we can then apply a fit
on both types of asymptotic spectra in order to compare the predictions of asymptotic real part and imaginary gap.
The results of the fits on both spectra yield:

FIG. 11: Plot on the complex plane of the QNMs values predicted by the Continued fraction method for scalar

Following this, we can take a look at the results given by the Continued fraction method for ¢ = 2, which are
supposed to have the same asymptotic behaviour as ¢ = 0 according to the monodromy prediction (see (59)). We
specifically considered the value P = 0.1, as it is easier to compare the asymptotic of a Schwarzschild-type spectrum.
One can find on figure [11] plots of QNMs with ¢ = 0 and ¢ = 2 for P = 0.1, and as well the corresponding monodromy
prediction for comparison. While the spectrum for ¢ = 0 seems relatively close to the monodromy one, the spectrum
for ¢ = 2 shows larger real part. We performed a fit in order to have a more precise idea. We found that, for = 2

In this study, we chose to move away from this perspective by studying perturbations of an effective BH model

use, as complement, another method which is especially made for highly damped modes: the monodromy technique.
The case of Modesto BH is quite close from the Reissner-Nordstr6m case, and the monodromy technique allows to
highlight the existence of asymptotic oscillating patterns.

We chose here to restrict ourselves to the study of the impact of the parameter P as the monodromy technique
for ag is more involved (see appendix [B). Moreover, ap is supposed to be, by construction, of Planck order while
deviations from the Schwarzschild BH can only be “seen” from a9 ~ 1071 (see [26]).

In our last study, we only focused on small values of P. Here, we chose to study the hole range of physical values
0 < P < 1 and then discovered the oscillating patterns, both in the Real part and in the Imaginary gap. We
highlighted and described the evolution of these phenomena with the polymeric function P, the angular momentum
arameter ¢ and for both spin 0 and spin 2 test-field perturbations.
Although the Continued fraction method showed weakness in the computation of oscillating and highly damped QNMs,
it still allowed to compute QNMs on a large part of the complex spectrum. It moreover showed great consistency
with the results of the monodromy technique, which predicts the asymptotic behaviour. The combination of these
wo techniques allowed us to analyse efficiently the QNMs on the hole complex plane.

The study of highly damped QNMs brings us back to the question of their meaning. If the constant Imaginary gap
of Schwarzschild BH is truly related to the discrete area spectrum of LQG [87], then how to explain the deviations
observed in the case of this effective model derived from LQG? The question arises all the more in view of the
oscillations patterns appearing. Which physical meaning do these asymptotic oscillations have compared to the
straight asymptote of the Schwarzschild BH?

Appendix A: Monodromy technique for the case ¢ = 1 (ao = 0)

In this section we consider the case ¢ = 1 for the computation of asymptotic scalar QNMs via the monodromy
technique. The core idea of this technique is to solve the master equation describing the evolution of the perturbations
around r = 0, in order to compute the monodromy of the field function around a well-chosen contour. To do so, we
use the first order expression of the effective potential around r = 0, which reads in the case of scalar perturbations
on the Modesto BH (where we set again ag = 0):

Pt ol
(1+ P)8 r6
However, as \ = ¢(¢ +1), one can see that this expression vanishes for = 1. The final equation cannot then

be valid for the case ¢ = 1. In order to handle this special case correctly, one has to use next-to-leading order for the
effective potential:

Va(r)'~” (A —2) + O(1). (Al)

r= a

which is actually the leading order in the case ¢ = 1.

The master equation describing scalar perturbations around the Modesto BH can then be simplified around r = 0 for

However, this equation does not correspond to a Bessel equation because of the term in x!/?, and we were not able
to find any other function satisfying this equation.

equation (B4), for ag = 0.1 and ap = 0.9 (with r, = 1). The dark blue regions correspond to Re(x) > 0.

In this section we will consider the case of the Modesto BH with P = 0 and ap being non-zero. The numerical
computation of QNMs in this case has already been considered our previous study [26], revealing interesting patterns.
Here we want to examine the monodromy technique in this context, which could be useful to study the asymptotic
spectrum in ao.

First, let us recall the metric functions in the case P = 0. The line element of the Modesto BH is given in equation
(1) and the metric reads:

This metric then represent a singularity free BH, with a minimal area given by the parameter ag which is then
expected to be of Planck order.
As the Modesto BH is a static and spherically BH, we can once again directly use the master equation for the field
function U(r)

ag +? V(r) = 0, (B2)
which controls the evolution of the test-field perturbations.
The effective potentials V,(7) are given by the general formulas for scalar and test-field spin 2 perturbations applied
to the metric functions (B1) and then read:

On the other side, the tortoise coordinate x reads:

a(n) =r4 ag(2r +75) _ ap log(r) (aj +r) log(r — rs)

(B4)

22 3 3
2r2r r3 rs
As we already explain, the monodromy technique focuses on the behaviour of the master equation around r = 0. First
we can take a look at the effective potential’s conduct. Its first order contribution around r = 0 reads

Moreover, the first order term of the tortoise coordinate is

ate

(B6)

such that the first order contribution of the effective potential V,(r) can be written in terms of the tortoise coordinate:

r=0 28—1

Va(r) = + O(1), (B7)

The master equation then can be written simply around r = 0 as

2w2 _
dv + (we +) w=0. (Bs)

dx 4x?

As usual, one can rescale the x-coordinate into z = wa and introduce the function W such that U(x) = ®(wx) V27w2.
This function now satisfies a straightforward Bessel equation:

2020 + 20,0 + (2 = 4) ®=0, (B9)

which can then be treated as usual in the process of the monodromy technique.

However, in order to apply properly the method, one need to choose a contour following the Stokes lines for the
computation of the monodromy of the field function. The behaviour of the tortoise coordinate is represented in the
complex r-plane in figure [15] with the Stokes line shown as black lines.

One can see that the light regions (corresponding to Re(«) < 0 are separated in two distinct regions with no connexion
via the Stokes lines. It is therefore difficult to conceive a contour following the Stokes lines in the way of the other
cases we covered and this case would require a more in-depth analysis.
