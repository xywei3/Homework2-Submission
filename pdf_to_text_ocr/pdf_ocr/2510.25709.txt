The unique off-shell fermionic gauge invariance of a vector-spinor field theory is found, and the
invariant action is derived. The latter is Weyl invariant in any dimension in the massless limit, and
it coincides with the singular point of the one-parameter family of Rarita-Schwinger Lagrangians.
Pure gauge configurations are represented by gamma-trace vector-spinors, which can be gauged away
in a global way. Previous claims that this theory is inconsistent are shown to be flawed, and the
Velo-Zwanziger instability is proved to be absent. The theory propagates a massive spin-3 particle

together with a spin-5 state whose mass is twice that of the 7 = 3 mode. This physical prediction is
derived in a consistent fashion both from the classical field equations in d = 4 and from the causal
construction of a gamma-traceless quantum vector-spinor field. The conformal anomaly is derived
using known results for the heat kernel of non-minimal second-order operators, and it is shown that
the a-anomaly has an opposite sign w.r.t. known results for lower spin fields.

INTRODUCTION

The most studied theory of spin-3 particles due to

Rarita and Schwinger [I] is known to lead to inconsis-
encies. This field theory is described by a vector-spinor
W,, whose vacuum field equations state the vanishing of
he gamma-trace and longitudinal components, thus get-
ing rid of the two s in- 4 irreducible representations [2].
As Johnson and Sudarshan [3] first showed, a way to
notice that the interacting theory is flawed is provided
oy computing the equal-time commutators and noticing
hat causality is jeopardized. Later, Velo and Zwanziger
[4] proved that this feature reflects the appearance of a
achyonic mode, which is found by analyzing the nor-
mals to the characteristic surfaces of the equations of
motion after substitution of the primary and secondary
constraints. Heuristically, this problem arises due to an
accidental symmetry of the free theory, which is bro-
ken when coupled to external backgrounds such as the
electromagnetic field. This implies that the number of
propagating d.o.f. is different in the free and interacting
theories.

The action introduced in [I] actually belongs to a one-
parameter family of actions which are physically indis-
tinguishable, and the parameter generates the so-callec
contact symmetry, see, e.g., [5]. In particular, the con-
struction of [5] shows that this theory can be derived by
demanding that there are 8 propagating degrees of free-
dom carried by a massive spin-2 particle. Notice thai
there is a singular value of this parameter in which the
aforementioned analyses do not apply anymore. Fur-
thermore, in a recent paper @ the authors performec
a Hamiltonian analysis of the constraints of the theory,
showing that Dirac’s conjecture [7] that the secondary
constraints “generate” gauge transformations does no
apply for the Rarita-Schwinger model, and also pointing
out that there is a physical spin-4 excitation.

In this paper the field theory of vector-spinors is re-

considered starting from a different perspective. The in-
ception is the following question: are there any consis-
tent (ie., not accidental) gauge symmetries that can be
imposed at the level of the kinetic Lagrangian? The an-
swer is that there is a unique such symmetry, which can
be also be imposed on the mass terms, thus yielding a
gauge invariant massive theory. The action matches the
singular value of the one-parameter family studied in [5],
which is interpreted in a novel manner. By analyzing the
conformal (Weyl) properties of vector-spinor theories it
is noticed that the massless theory is not only conformal,
by it is the only theory belonging to the intersection of
conformal actions and the aforementioned one-parameter
family. Velo and Zwanziger’s computation is carried
over in this model too, yielding no superluminal propa-
gation for any configuration of the external gauge poten-
tials.

By using spin-projectors one deduces that the gamma-
trace vector-spinors belong to the kernel of the
functional and can be gauged away in a global fashion.
This is the reason why it was mistakenly stated that the
Green’s function does not exist in the “singular” limit
of the one-parameter family of operators. The resulting
field equations are different from those encountered in the
literature. Specifically, in a local patch and in absence of
interactions the e.o.m. can be written as two Dirac equa-
tions for the transverse and longitudinal components of
a gamma-traceless vector-spinor w,,. The physical pre-
diction is that the spin-3 mode has twice the mass of the
spin-3 particle.

The quantization problem of the physical gamma-
traceless vector-spinor w,, is tackled by following Wein-
berg’s construction of causal quantum fields [8] (see also
Chapter 5 of {9]). The mode decomposition and the
relative normalization of the 7 = 3 and j = 5 coef-
ficient functions are derived by requiring that all anti-
commutators vanish at space-like separations. Most im-
portantly, the same field equations derived from first

FERMIONIC GAUGE INVARIANCE

principles arise as a by-product of the construction, and
the Feynman propagator is explicitly built.

Finally, the 1-loop quantum fluctuations of the fielc
{p, on top of a general Riemannian background are con-
sidered by computing the logarithmically divergent par
of the effective action using the heat kernel technique.
This is achieved by employing the recently-found model-
independent expression for the traced second heat kerne
coefficient for non-minimal second-order operators [10].
The result is consistent with that of a Weyl conformal
theory explicitly broken by the presence of a mass term
in the action. In this case the physical prediction is tha’
the contribution to the a-anomaly has an opposite
sign w.r.t. fields with spin s < 1.

The appendix fixes the conventions regarding the
spacetime signature and the Clifford algebra, it provides
the explicit form of the coefficient functions that are not
reported in the main text and contains the expressions of
some tensor coefficients which appear in the heat kernel
integration of the 1-loop fluctuations.

THE RARITA-SCHWINGER FRAMEWORK

Here we briefly introduce the Rarita-Schwinger frame-
work for describing spin-3 particles through a specific ac-
tion functional involving the vector-spinor V,,. To derive
this action one usually requires it to be at most linear in
the derivatives, hermitian and such that the equations of
motion of the free theory can be written as [2] [5] [12] [13]

(@+m)¥, =0,

7: ¥=0. (1)

By combining the two equations one notices that
0-V=0. (2)

It turns out that there exists a one-parameter family of
Lagrangians that yields these field equations. The op-
erator that enters such Lagrangians depends on a free
real parameter a which tunes an internal rotation in the
spin-5 subspace, and it reads

AMY (a) = (WF +m) gi” + a(yhW" + V9")

(d-la?+2a4+1 ,,
ar = ed (3)

d(d—lja?+4(d-l)a+d
Wp myty” .

This internal rotation signals an underlying contact sym-
metry of the Lagrangian. The operator that is applied
to a generic vector-spinor V,, and rotates the two spin-5
eigenspaces is

Gn" (b) = bu" + bY", (4)

which is singular for b = —i. Recalling the form of the
Rarita-Schwinger operator [1] [2] [4]

we can write down the one-parameter operator Eq. (3)

AMY (a) = 6 o(—$45) Mes 8.” (— $43). (6)

The properties of the system are insensitive to the value
of the free parameter a, which bears no physical mean-
ing. The rotations Eq. give rise to a group structure,
and the symmetry of the physical properties under such
rotations is known as contact symmetry [5]. On the other
hand, we notice that for a = -4 the parameter of the ro-
tation assumes its singular value b = -4, and the physics
described by the theory is completely different.

Whenever a # -4 the field equations R’ = 0 have
both a primary constraint y-R = 0 and a secondary con-
straint V-R = 0. In the free theory in flat spacetime
this implies that both spin-$ modes of W,, are unphysi-
cal. However, in the presence of non-trivial background
electromagnetic fields one can see that one spin-5 mode
is physical [4]. Thus, an inconsistency arises in that there
is a difference in the number of the dynamical degrees of
freedom between the free and interacting theories. Fur-
thermore, in the latter case an unphysical superluminal
propagation of the vector-spinor is found along a specific
irection, thus providing a non-trivial example of how
Lorentz invariance can be broken in spite of the man-
est covariance of the field equations [4]. Technically
eaking, this behavior arises because both constraints
can be substituted in the field equations in a local fash-
on, so that superluminal propagation is seen to occur in
the presence of a static homogeneous magnetic field by
studying the normals to the characteristic surfaces. This
unphysical property can be attributed to the fact that
the longitudinal modes V,,€ belong to the kernel of the
Rarita-Schwinger operator Eq. in the free field limit
only, while they contribute to the dynamics whenever
general background fields are present.

FERMIONIC GAUGE INVARIANCE

The most general linear self-adjoint differential opera-
tor acting on a vector-spinor WV,, is given by

AMP = yBYPT, + a (VHVP 4+.9°V") + BBX ye. (7)

We want to constraint the two dimensionless coefficients
a and £ by imposing a fermionic gauge invariance like the
one considered in [IJ 2], but requiring that this symmetry
hols off the mass shell and in the presence of arbitrary in-
teractions. A gauge transformation is written as a linear
differential operator acting on a Dirac spinor e. Thus,

the most general one comprises two independent tensor
structures, i.e.,

56, Up = AV pe + O27” VE. (8)

Here 6;,2 are real constants, and the commonly studied
case is given by 2 = 0 [I] 2]. By imposing gauge invari-
ance, i.e.,

of AMew, = 0, (9)

we find that there is a single solution to the previous
equation, which sets 0; = 62, i.e.,

OF Uy = Vue +n’ Vve = WWE; (10)
whereas the invariant operator is

d-2

(d + 1)(d- 2)

In contrast with the local transformation 6w,, = V,¢, Eq.

does not require any ad hoc assumption about the

background fields to yield an invariant action. Moreover,

the local transformation also permits to write down

a gauge invariant mass term

Thus, using Eq. (A.10) the massive gauge invariant op-

erator can be written as

"Gd (« d-i’ )°

This operator corresponds to the “singular” case of the
one-parameter family of operators, see Eq.
ever, fermionic gauge invariance makes this operator
stand on a new and independent footing. As a matter of
fact, the previously mentioned impossibility of deriving
the Green’s function [5] are manifestly due to gauge in-
variance. Thus, if one is to find such a Green’s function,
a gauge-fixing term should be added to the action, whose
operator may be written as

Conformal properties

Let us now analyze the conformal (Weyl) properties of
our operator Eq. (2). First of all, we fix our conventions
by choosing

ONY Guv = 209uv 5 OW UY, =woW,, (14)

where w is the Weyl’s weight of the vector-spinor, which
is fixed by noticing that the infinitesimal transformation
of curved-space gamma matrices is

bP Yu = Op: (15)
Whence, the weight is wy, = —£3. Moreover,

the torsion-free spin-connection we, and the affine-
connection T'?,,, transform as [14]

Mu, = (e,Rr® _ e,BY*) ao; Hay

ONT Pn = 25? WOn)o — Quv0’o.
Up to homogeneous terms the Wey] transformation of the
three different kinetic tensor structures operators that

enter Eq. are
OW HYP UW, = (d — 2) (sare) Wa;
5M (q#V? +7°V4) U, = —d (vane) W,; (17)
5 "UY, = 0,

Therefore, the newly found fermionic gauge transforma-
tion is compatible with Wey] invariance when m = 0,
whereas this is not the case for the commonly studied
local transformation 6V,, = V,¢. Furthermore, the ki-
netic part of Eq. (12) represents the only element of the
intersection between conformal operators and the one-
parameter family of operators (Bp. Notice also that Weyl
invariance is not sufficient for fixing the relative coeffi-
cients of the three differential operators entering Eq.
for the last term in is Weyl covariant. Thus, the con-
formal operator for a vector-spinor V,, can be written in
terms of a dimensionless constant c as

Aeon = Wg” — ("VE + Vi") +e", (18)
Thus, the compatibility of fermionic and Wey] gauge in-
variances manifestly holds in any spacetime dimension,
while an analogous feature arises in electrodynamics and
Yang-Mills theories only in d = 4. In spite of this appeal-
ing feature we shall not attempt to study the physics of
conformal vector-spinors in a generic dimension d.

CONSISTENCY OF THE CLASSICAL THEORY

We now turn to analyze the propagating degrees of
freedom of the fermionic gauge invariant action |
this end, we first employ spin projectors to re-write the
operator Eq. ( in a more convenient form and derive
the field equations, then we analyze the constraints that
follow from the field equations and finally we show that
no Velo-Zwanziger instability is present.

Spin projectors

We choose a different parameterization of the spin pro-
jectors onto the spin-5 sector w.r.t. that which has been
employed in the literature [5|[15]. The first such projector
is given by

(Pia), = sic (19)

which projects onto vector-spinors that can be written
as y, times a Dirac spinor. The complementary spin-3
projector is given by

L 1

which produces gamma-traceless longitudinal vector-
spinors. The intertwining projectors are

Finally, the spin-3 projector reads

and the usual completeness and idempotence relations
are satisfied

P?P? =P?,

Furthermore, it turns out convenient to define the pro-
jector onto gamma-traceless vector-spinors, which reads

ultra-local, i.e., they do not depend on the momentum
ph.

Field equations and constraints

The first step in the analysis of the dynamical degrees
of freedom is provided by re-writing the gauge invariant

operator Eq. using the spin projector Eq. ( The
result is remarkably simple, i.e,
AM = (PIT)" (7 +m) (PIT). (25)

Thus, gauge invariance tells us that the gamma-trace
vector-spinor configurations belong to the kernel of the
action. Indeed, by performing the following global split-
ting

1 ‘ ‘
Wp =Uet qux: with y=7"U, (26)

we find that
SU,¥|= si.) = [HH +mxy. 27)

Thus, the number of degrees of freedom in d = 4 is at
most 16-4 = 12.

To find the field equations we have to remember that
the gamma-traceless condition is purely algebraic, i.e., it
is analogous to the traceless condition for symmetric 2-
tensors. Thence, functional variations must be consistent
with such an algebraic property, in formulae

ob, 1

5p, = On ad Yue (28)

Accordingly, by varying Eq. ) we find the following
field equations for the gamma-traceless vector-spinor {,

2 '
Ry = Mbp — GV btm, = 0. (29)

In the Rarita-Schwinger framework the gamma-traceless
condition is derived as a constraint following from the
vacuum field equations by computing y - R = 0, whereas
now 7: R vanishes identically. Thus, only the secondary
constraint is non-trivial, and it reads

d-2 d ; ;
ve R= 93? (w+ hom) vw (30)

1
+7 (SR a ieP*,) oy = 9,

where e is the charge of the vector-spinor. Another strik-
ing difference w.r.t. the Rarita-Schwinger theory arises
from by analyzing the secondary constraint. In flat space
and in absence of background electromagnetic fields Eq.
tells us that the longitudinal mode V - w obeys the
Dirac equation with mass qm, while in the Rarita-
Schwinger V -~ = 0 in such a limit, yielding 8 degrees of
freedom.

Absence of Velo-Zwanziger instabilities

To proceed further, let us specialize to the physical
dimension d = 4 and briefly perform a 3 + 1 decompo-
sition of the Lagrangian. Gauge invariance then implies
QUANTUM THEORY: THE MODE DECOMPOSITION

that only 12 d.o.f. are physical, and we can exploit the
gamma-tracelessness to write

Yo = 7'v (31)

Accordingly, the Lagrangian £ takes the following form

L=-B, [59 +m) +9 W+m)]vi. (32)
In contrast with the analysis performed by Velo and
Zwanziger [4] we cannot make use of the secondary con-
straint Eq. ) in a local fashion. Thus, the previous
Lagrangian already yields the first-order differential op-
erator whose normals n, to the characteristic surfaces
we want to study. This is done by extracting the symbol
D% that multiplies the time derivative in the previous
equation, i.e.,

Di = BaP 4 ay, (33)

Notice that the 8-dimensional space defined by y¢); = 0
provides eigenvectors of the previous matrix with eigen-
value 7°, whereas the 4-dimensional space spanned by
w;, = VA also yields eigenvectors, whose eigenvalues are
—2y7°. The physical solutions of the field equations are
also solutions of
det DY =0, (34)

which determines the normals to the characteristic sur-
faces. Using a general normal vector n, and employing
the previous argument we can rewrite the last equation
in a Lorentz covariant fashion as

det D= (nyy")® (2ry")* =
Clearly, there exists no configuration of the external
gauge fields such that this equation is solved for space-
like n,,. Therefore, the loss of causality that was found
in the Rarita-Schwinger case [4] does not take place here.
Therefore, in d = 4 the field equations Eq. describe
the causal propagation of 8 spin-2 degrees of freedom
with mass m and 4 spin-3 d.o.f. with mass 2m.

QUANTUM THEORY: THE MODE
DECOMPOSITION

A free massive quantum field theory is defined by the
eigenvalues of the Casimir of the Poincaré algebra, which
are described by the mass m and spin j. These iden-
tify particles together with additional quantum numbers,
such as the electric charge. For massive theories the in-
trinsic redundancy of the field-theoretical description is
removed by noting that particles must provide irreducible
representations of Wigner’s little group, i.e., spatial ro-
tations [8]. Furthermore, fields with a non-zero number

of spacetime indices may carry more than a single physi-
cal such irreducible representation, thus describing more
than a single physical particle (see, e.g., [16]).

Let us illustrate this feature of quantum field theory
in the case of a gamma-traceless vector-spinor

€ (1,5) ©.) ,
which belongs to a 12-dimensional irreducible representa-
ion of the Lorentz group. A complex spin j = 3 particle
carries 8 degrees of freedom, thus the remaining 4 d.o.f.
are described by a j = Fi particle. In a generic Lorentz
rame the two spin states can be singled out by applying
spin projectors, with the 7 = 3 particle defined by the
ransversality condition pq, = 0.

In what follows we explicitly construct the coefficient

dp = 9, (36)

functions for a generic vector-spinor 7, subject to Eq.
(36) such that the following causality condition is satis-
fied

for («—y)?>0.

{du(x), vb (y)} =0

Let us commence by writing down the ansatz of the mode

where wr and y, are the annihilation and creation op-
erators. Moreover, a is summed over the two irreducible
representations of rotations, i.e., a = 3 3. Thus, the
only non-vanishing anti-commutation relation are

{aa(p,s),a4,(p',s')} = B(p—p')dssSaar- (39)

Notice that the coefficient functions are dimensionless.
Consider a matrix J% providing an irreducible spin-j
representation of the rotation group, and let TH be the
generators of rotations. Then, in the rest frame the coef-
ficient functions ®7(0,s) and =;(0,s) of the annihilation

and creation operators must satisfy, respectively [8} [9]

where s,s’ = j ;—j and « stands for complex conju-
gation. These equations represent the starting point for
the derivation of the coefficient functions of any massive
causal quantum field.

A vector-spinor w,, is described in terms of its temporal
and spatial parts as

Vn = (Wi, Wo) , (41)

a
QUANTUM THEORY: THE MODE DECOMPOSITION

and likewise for the coefficient functions y, and x,, of the
annihilation and construction operators. While the tem-
poral component can only transform as a j = 3 Dirac
spinor under rotations, the spatial ones are given by a
sum of j = 3 and j = 5 states. To better grasp this
feature, let us write down the generators of rotation that
act on these spaces. In the vector and Dirac spinor rep-
resentation a rotation around the k direction takes the

following simple forms
1 fo, 0
(a)

Thus,

(Iu)Y'5 = —ie'jn, (Tu)® =

where o; are the Pauli matrices. in the vector-
spinor representation we have

(Ju)4; = tej, + st a; (43)

j j D\0 ox

Let us look at Eq. (40a). By squaring it we have that the
left hand side is diagonal, and it reads j(j+1)d5®,(0, s).
Instead, on the spatial components ~; on the right-hand-
side we are acting with

F 15 .; ig,
(KUT; = youn _ (’ Oj ’,): (44)

Thus, the spin 7 = 3 part of w; is that whose coefficient

functions satisfy

(5 Sets =0, (5 2)xi@s=0, cs)

while we have a spin j = $ state provided that
a'o; O 1/2 _ 1/2

3x70, 8).

(46)

From the last two equations we see that a possible pa-
rameterization of the 7 = 3 part of y; and x; is given
by
1/2

where wu and v are the zero-momentum coefficient func-
tions of the annihilation and creation operators of a Dirac
field. Let us also observe that the relative phases of the
left- and right-handed spinor subspaces cannot be fixed
at this level, hence a 75 factor may appear on the r.h.s.
of the previous equations.

As we have said above, there is a second j = 5
which is carried by wp. However, the gamma-traceless
condition Eq. (36) implies that only a linear combination
of the two 7 = 5 modes is physical. Indeed, a covariant

2 mode

way to describe the j = 3
spinor is provided by

particle carried by the vector-

Ul? = (Ou — ZnB) d (48)
where . is a Dirac spinor and the tensor structure on the

where s = +4 and similar equations hold for xi/7(0, 8)

mined relative to that of the 7 = 3 coefficient functions.

We now derive the specific form of the coefficient func-
tions, starting from the spin 7 = 3 part. In this case the
generators of rotations are

we work out the coefficient functions of the destruction
operators. This time a differe constant c enters the result,
see Eq.s . By requiring that the field transforms
in a simple fashion under parity we deduce that these
constants must be sign factors [9].

QUANTUM THEORY: THE MODE DECOMPOSITION

Having derived the parametric form of the coefficient
functions in the rest frame, we can compute the spin
sums. After some algebra we find

where 8 = iy°. Notice that both equations are con-
sistently y;-traceless on the left- and right-hand-sides.
Moreover, the spin sums are clearly orthogonal to the

time direction. Thus, in a generic Lorentz frame the spin
sums must be orthogonal to both p, and y,,. Hence, they
are given by

where the result for the Dirac case [9] simply multiplies

Now we focus on the spin j = 5 part of the vector-

coefficient functions of the annihilation and creation op-
erators. They can be written in terms of a scaling con-
stant « and two sign factors f and g as

Now use the fact that both the 7 = 3 and j = 3 par-

with a similar equation holding for the construction coef-
ficients. Since the two spin modes are to be described by
the sole field variable ,,, we must be able to factor out
the gamma-traceless projector, say on the right. Then,
using the definition of the gamma-traceless projector Eq.
(24) we obtain

Kak, bimy/2 = 2f m3/2-

(63)
Given that 6 and f are sign factors, these equations are
solved by kK = HAs b = f and m/z = 2m3/2, where
we notice a sign ambiguity in the value of x. The last
equation c omrech y reproduces the mass ratio of the 7 = 3
and j = es obtained in the classical analysis of
the previous section. The counterpart of Eq. (2) for
the construction coefficients yield c = g. Then, a
direct consequence of these findings and using Eq.
the anticommutator of the field and its adjoint can be

Since this function is even when its argument is spacelike

Finally, up to a redefinition of 7, involving ys we can
take b = 1, and we are now free to drop the subscript
in the masses, choosing m = m3/2. As a consequence of
the present construction and exploiting the transversality
pipe? = plyal? = 0, we observe that the coefficient
functions satisfy the following equations

(itsyr — Layo’ +mo,") o8(p,8) =0:

this field propagates two spin states according to the field

in perfect accordance with the ab initio analysis per-
formed in the previous section (see Eq. (29).

The behavior of a vector-spinor under discrete trans-
formations can be derived by combining the known re-
sults for vectors and Dirac spinors [9]. In particular, un-
der parity we have

Pu, (x)P~* = —1°8,(P2), (69)

where 77 is the intrinsic parity of the 7 = 3 particles
carried by ~,. Antiparticles transform in a similar way,
with 7° replacing 7*. In particular, causality implies that
n° n* = —1 like in the Dirac case.

Finally, the sign ambiguity in the numerical value of

j= Fi sector. Thus, we may always let gil? > —yi/ 2

The propagator

One of the possible definitions of the propagator

By using the explicit results for the coefficient functions

and 0(2) is the Heaviside step function. Then, employing
the integral representation of this function we obtain

Of course, all 6 factors on the right-hand-sides disappear
when we take into account Dn instead of oh.

According to Eq.s and (74) no difficulty arises in
defining the Feynman propagator for a gamma-traceless
vector-spinor w,,. Moreover, Eq.s show that this
propagator is consistent with the Lagrangian description
of this field based on the gauge-invariant action Eq. (27).

QUANTUM THEORY: THE CONFORMAL
ANOMALY

A standard procedure of deriving the divergent part of
the effective action on curved spacetime is to rely on the
heat kernel technique [T7H19]. To this end, one notices
that the spectrum of the 75-adjoint of the linear differ-
ential operator A,” and that of A,,” itself are identical,

Trlog (A,”) = Trlog (ysAy"5) - (75)

Therefore, one can express the spectrum of the first order
differential operator A,,” in terms of the following second
order one

QUANTUM THEORY: THE CONFORMAL ANOMALY

To compute the divergent part of the effective action we
employ the heat kernel technique, which rests on the def-
inition of the kernel [18} [20], i-e.,

K(a,y;s) =e #O5(a,y), (77)
where s is the so-called proper-time and has dimension

of a squared length. From the definition, one derives the
following Schrédinger-like equation for the kernel

Then, the trace of the logarithm of the operator H can
be written as

where in the last step we have inserted the asymptotic
expansion of the heat kernel valid for second-order op-
erators [18]. When the operator H is non-minimal, i.e.,
its principal part is not just given by a box operator,
he asymptotic expansion can be written only in the co-
incidence limit y — x, which is sufficient to compute
he divergent part of the effective action. The coeffi-
cients of this expansion are known as Seeley-DeWitt co-
efficients @,, and they are local covariant functions of
he dimensionful tensors that describe the operator [20].
Dimension-four counter-terms are then extracted by com-
uting the @ coefficient, which is also proportional to the
conformal anomaly [19]. Thus, the computation of this
coefficient will be our goal henceforth.

Let us make some remarks on some crucial properties of
this non-minimal second order operator. Since the ex-
plicit parameterization of longitudinal modes is propor-
tional to V,A— +1, they do not belong to the kernel
of Eq. (81). Therefore, this second-order non-minimal
operator has a non-degenerate principal part, and it be-
longs to the family of causal operators which have been
first studied in [20]. Recently, using a refined version of

the algorithm used in [21], a model-independent result for
the local terms of the divergent part of the effective action
was found in [10]. This paper was published alongside an
open-source Mathematica code that has been employed
to carry out most of the subsequent computations.

To apply the heat kernel technique to non-minimal
second-order operators one needs to rely on a trick that
was first exploited in 20]. The idea is that the principal
part of the operator Hy? can be written as a special case
of a one-parameter family of non-singular second-order
operators as

jp - Va’ — |

Then, the full operator is simply given by the sum of the
principal part and the rest as

To go back to coordinate space we must choose an order-
ing of the covariant derivatives in the non-minimal term
of K,,?(V). Our choice is given by

The explicit expressions of these tensors are written in

To combine these tensor coefficient

into the general
equations derived in [10] it is particularly convenient to
make use of a given basis in the Clifford algebra. This is
done by splitting these tensors according to the Clifford

M(2).08 HY = ~ tr (M(2)?? > 7H”) . (92c)

The subscripts in the previous equations stand for scalar,
pseudo-scalar and tensor. This splitting enables us
to write the general equations of [10] in a reasonably
tractable manner, and most importantly it hugely sim-
plifies the computation of the Dirac traces while keeping
track only implicitly of the actual functional dependence
in the tensor coefficients.

By combining the the contributions coming from the
two trace logs in Eq. and computing the ¢ integral

We have chosen to express the higher-derivative part of
this expression in terms of the so-called Wey] basis, which
is given by the square of the Weyl tensor Wyypo, the
Euler density £4 and the square of the Ricci scalar (see,

., [22]). In the massless limit the starting Lagrangian
is Wey] invariant, therefore the traced second Seeley-
DeWitt coefficient does not depend on the square of the
Ricci scalar, whose infinitesimal Wey] transformation law
is affine.

This calculation yields a new expression for the con-
formal anomaly of gamma-traceless vector-spinors 7, in
the limit m — 0, which can be contrasted with the pre-
viously known result by Endo [23] which is valid on Ein-
stein spaces. Indeed, classically Weyl invariant actions
generate the following local contributions to the confor-
mal anomaly [TT]

Here the numerical subscripts stand for the spin of the
particles propagated by fields. Since in the present case
the analysis of the propagating degrees of freedom has
shown that we have more than one physical spin mode,
we have opted for labeling the contribution of Vp ina
different manner. The most interesting feature of our
calculation is the negative sign in the a-anomaly due to
vector-spinors. In fact, if we consider a model involving 9
scalars, 2 Dirac fermions and 1 gauge field together with
a vector-spinor, the a-anomaly vanishes identically. The
total derivative part of the conformal anomaly cannot
be computed with the present method, however a newly
found result can be applied to work it out.

CONCLUSIONS

Poincaré invariance and the cluster decomposition
principle necessarily imply the necessity of a field de-
scription of particles [9]. However, the Rarita-Schwinger
action fails to provide a consistent theory of spin-3 parti-
cles through a vector-spinor field as soon as interactions
are introduces [3] [4]. Back in '64 Weinberg’s take on
this issue was that it represents a drawback of the La-
grangian description of the field theory [8]. However,
the Lagrangian formulation of QFT has proved to be

of the

descri

in the derivation and mathematical description
Standard Model of particle physics. Thus, seri-
ttempt should be made to retain the Lagrangian
ption in any tentative interacting theory of higher-
spin particles. To this end, this problem may be stated
in a different manner by saying that it is not possible to
describe spin-3 particles through a consistent QFT that
ropagates this particle only. Accordingly, the aim of
he present paper was to show that a consistent quantum
hheory of vector-spinors is found once this assumption is
amended.

Thus, this work provides a first attempt to find a so-
ution to the long-standing conundrum of describing in-
eracting higher-spin particles by focusing on the sim-
lest example of 7 = 3. The Lagrangian description is
fixed by requiring the presence of an off-shell fermionic
gauge symmetry valid regardless of the configurations of
he background electromagnetic and gravitational fields.
The resulting Lagrangian is unique, and it is given by
“singular” element of the one-parameter family of oper-
ators describing spin-3 particles found in the literature
[5]. The arguments that were proposed to discard such
a theory are shown to be flawed in that they do not ac-
count for the gauge-invariance of the action. Moreover,
in the massless limit and in any spacetime dimension this
action fixes the arbitrary parameter that enters the most
general Weyl invariant action for a vector-spinor.

By employing spin-projectors, it is shown that the
gamma-trace configurations 7, of a generic vector-
spinor W,, belong to the kernel of the action, and that
they can be gauged away in a global fashion. Thus,
the theory involves only the irreducible representation
of the Lorentz group given by a, € (1, 3) @ (5, 1), where
7", = 0. The field equations R" = 0 of the new theory
are derived, and it is shown that only the secondary con-
straint V - R = 0 is present, which in the free field limit
fixes the relative values of the masses of the 7 = 3 and
j= 3 particles. Finally, the Velo-Zwanziger instability
is proved to be absent.

A complementary analysis of the mode decomposition
a free causal quantum vector-spinor w, € (1, 3) ®
3, 1) is then carried out. The relative normalization of
ne two spin sectors is derived, and the mass of the spin-
is consistently found to be twice that of the spin-3
article. Thus, the same field equations that are found
y imposing the off-shell fermionic gauge invariance are
btained as eigenvalue equations for the coefficient func-
tions, and the Feynman propagator is constructed.

Finally, the L-loop quantum fluctuations of the vector-
spinor y, are considered using the heat kernel technique.
The conformal anomaly is derived up to boundary terms,
and the opposite sign of the a-anomaly w.r.t. spin s < 1
fields is noticed.

Future works are needed to understand if the present
picture can be extended also to fermionic tensor fields of
higher rank. In particular, it is compelling to known if

the consistency between the field theoretical description
based on an off-shell fermionic gauge invariance and the
mode decomposition of a causal quantum field belonging
to an irreducible representation of the Lorentz group is
valid beyond the j = 3 case. Furthermore, it is natu-
ral to ask ourselves if any such extended theory is also
Weyl invariant. Finally, the physically interesting as-
pects of this field-theoretical work will be to comprehend
how many particles are propagated by a rank-k totally
symmetric fermionic field, which are the ratios between
the masses, and foremost if this putative theories pro-
vide a phenomenologically acceptable description of A
resonances.
