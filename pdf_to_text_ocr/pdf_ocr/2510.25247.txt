ABSTRACT

X-ray observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate AT 2019avd show drastic variabilities in flux and spectral
shape over hundreds of days, providing clues on the accretion disc-corona evolution. We utilize a disc-corona model, in which
a fraction of the gravitational energy released in the disc is transported into the hot corona above/below. Some soft photons
emitted from the disc are upscattered to X-ray photons by the hot electrons in the optically thin corona. By fitting the NICER
observations of AT 2019avd during epochs when the spectra exhibit significant hardening, we derive the evolution of the mass
accretion rate, 7, and the coronal energy fraction, f. Our results show that f decreases with increasing 7, which is qualitatively
consistent with that observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), while the slope of this source, f cc ri~°-3°, is much shallower
than that of AGNs. We also find that the non-thermal X-ray spectrum in this source is significantly softer than those typically
seen in AGNs and black-hole X-ray binaries. We argue that these quantitative differences can be a powerful diagnostic of the
underlying magnetic turbulence, which may imply a stronger magnetic field within the TDE accretion disc than that in typical
AGNs. It is also found that the evolution of the fitted neutral hydrogen column density follows a similar pattern to that of the
accretion rate evolution, which may reflect the accumulation of absorbing material originating from the inflowing streams of

1 INTRODUCTION

Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses ranging from 10° to
10! Mz are believed to reside in almost all galaxies (e.g. Kormendy
& Ho 2013; Heckman & Best 2014). Through the accretion of sur-
rounding gas, these black holes grow and convert gravitational energy
into intense radiation, manifesting as active galactic nuclei (AGNs).
In the standard AGN paradigm, the accreting material forms a geo-
metrically thin, optically thick accretion disc in most bright AGNs
(e.g. Shakura & Sunyaev 1973; Frank et al. 2002). The characteristic
temperature of the inner accretion disc is ~ 10+ — 10° K, and the
radiation from an accretion disc surrounding a SMBH is dominant
in optical/UV wavebands (e.g. Shakura & Sunyaev 1973), while the
power-law hard X-ray emission has been detected ubiquitously in
AGNs. It was suggested that the power-law hard X-ray spectra of
AGN are most likely due to the inverse Compton scattering of soft
photons emitted from the disc on a population of hot electrons in
the corona above/below the disc (e.g. Galeev et al. 1979; Haardt &
Maraschi 1991; Svensson & Zdziarski 1994). In this disc-corona sce-
nario, most gravitational energy is generated in the cold disc through
the turbulence produced by the magnetorotational instability (Balbus
& Hawley 1991). The magnetic fields generated in the cold disc may

be strongly buoyant, and therefore a substantial fraction of magnetic
energy is transported vertically to heat the corona above the disc
with the re-connection of the fields (Di Matteo 1998; Di Matteo et al.
1999; Merloni & Fabian 2001, 2002; Cao 2009). The disc-corona
model was extensively explored in many previous works, which is
able to reproduce the main features of AGN spectra (e.g., Haardt
& Maraschi 1991; Haardt & Maraschi 1993; Svensson & Zdziarski
1994; Liu et al. 2002; Cao 2009; You et al. 2012). However, AGNs
are fed by circumnuclear gas in quasi-steady state, and the timescale
of AGN evolution is usually very long, which is comparable with the
accretion timescale (~ 104-5 years; e.g., Feng et al. 2021). It is there-
fore very difficult to monitor the spectral evolution of an individual
AGN.

If the SMBH’s tidal force dominates over the self-gravity of the
star when it passes within the tidal radius of the SMBH, the star
will be torn apart, resulting in a tidal disruption event (TDE; Hills
1975; Rees 1988; Phinney 1989).The debris may form a disc sur-
rounding the SMBH, and the light curve of the disc emission reaches
a peak rapidly, and then decays on timescales of months to years.
The released power of the disc can approach or even exceed the Ed-
dington luminosity, which provides a unique opportunity to study
the rapid evolution of accretion processes (e.g. Evans & Kochanek
1989; Gezari 2021). Unlike AGNs, TDEs are powered by the sudden
fallback of stellar debris, forming transient accretion systems. Many
previous studies show strong evidence of compact accretion discs in

TDEs (e.g. Lodato & Rossi 2011; Piran et al. 2015; Dai et al. 2018).
In several respects, these systems share similarities with black hole
X-ray binaries (XRBs), such as rapid variability and the physics of
the disc (e.g. Remillard & McClintock 2006), while the mass feeding
in XRBs is quite different from AGNs or TDEs (Cao & Lai 2019).

X-ray emission of TDE can be described by a combination of
a blackbody and a power-law component(e.g. Komossa 2015). The
blackbody component with temperature in the range of ~ 10° —
10° K may probably be emitted from the disc, while the power-
law component may originate in the corona. TDEs often exhibit
extreme soft X-ray spectra in their early stages(e.g. Bade et al. 1996;
Komossa et al. 2004; Komossa 2015). At the later stages, the thermal
component tends to be weaken, and the X-ray emission becomes
increasingly dominated by the power-law component with spectral
hardening (e.g. Bade et al. 1996; Komossa et al. 2004; Komossa
2015; Yao et al. 2025). These findings provide useful information
of the evolution of transient disc-corona systems in TDEs. In recent
years, a few studies have begun exploring the application of disk-
corona models to TDEs (e.g. Mageshwaran & Bhattacharyya 2022,
2023).

The high-energy nuclear transient AT 2019avd, located at a red-
shift of z = 0.028, was first detected in the optical band by the Zwicky
Transient Facility (ZTF, Bellm et al. 2018) on 2019, February 9
(Nordin et al. 2019). Its significant flaring activities have been cap-
tured by multi-wavelength follow-up observations (e.g. Malyali et al.
2021; Wang et al. 2023). AT 2019avd exhibits several characteristics
consistent with a TDE, including ultra-soft X-ray spectra and optical
spectral lines typical of known TDEs. Although its double-peaked
optical light curve is somewhat unusual, similar optical evolution
has been observed in other TDEs (e.g. Yao et al. 2023). Thus, it is
classified as a TDE candidate. Although the precise trigger of the X-
ray activity relative to the optical outburst remains uncertain, several
studies suggest that the X-ray flare occurred after the initial optical
brightening (e.g. Malyali et al. 2021; Chen et al. 2022; Wang et al.
2023).

Wang et al. (2024) reported intensive X-ray monitoring of AT
2019avd with the NICER, Swift and Chandra telescopes between
2020 September 19 and 2021 June 16. Based on the X-ray proper-
ties, they divided this period into five phases. Setting MJD 59110
as Day 0—the moment when AT 2019avd reached its peak X-ray
luminosity—the phases correspond to Day 0-100 (Phase 1), Day
101-172 (Phase 2), Day 173-225 (Phase 3), Day 226-249 (Phase 4),
and Day 250 onward (Phase 5). In Phase 1, the X-ray luminosity
declined by about a factor of five with little variations in the hard-
ness ratio (defined as the photon count ratio between the 0.8-2 keV
and 0.30.8 keV bands). In Phase 2, the luminosity unexpectedly re-
brightened to a secondary peak. Phase 3 saw a rapid luminosity drop
by approximately an order of magnitude, followed by further fading
during Phases 4 and 5, where AT 2019avd became extremely faint
in X-rays. Throughout Phases 2-5, the X-ray hardness ratio steadily
increased. This evolution pattern suggests the possible evolution of
a disc-corona system.

In this work, we adopt an accretion disc-corona model developed
by Cao (2009), which computes the X-ray continuum spectrum of
the corona for specified parameters, to describe the late-time X-ray
hardening of AT 2019avd. By fitting the NJCER X-ray spectra of
AT 2019avd during Phases 3 and 4 with our model, we derive the
temporal evolution of the accretion rate, the fraction of gravitational
energy dissipated in the corona, and the coronal temperature. The
framework of the disc-corona model, and the results are described in
in Sections 2 and 3 respectively, In Section 4, we fit the observational

MNRAS 000, I-10 (2025)

data of AT2019 avd during Phases 3 and 4 using the model. Section
5 contains the discussion.

2 THE DISC-CORONA MODEL

We consider a system composed of a geometrically thin and optically
thick accretion disc and a slab-like, geometrically thick and optically
thin hot corona situated above and below the disc. The gravitational
energy of the gas is released in the disc through viscous processes,
which is believed to be the turbulence most probably triggered by the
magneto-rotational instability (Balbus & Hawley 1991). A fraction of
released gravitational energy is transported vertically into the corona
by magnetic fields of the disc, which heats the hot plasma in the
corona via magnetic reconnection, while the remainder is radiated
out from the disc. The heating of the corona is balanced by radiative
cooling, which is dominated by the inverse Compton scattering of
soft photons from the underlying disc by the hot coronal electrons.

In our model, we neglect the spin of the black hole and adopt the
standard accretion disc framework (e.g. Shakura & Sunyaev 1973;
Frank et al. 2002). The gravitational energy released by viscous
dissipation per unit area is given by

, (1)

Quissi = gaps || Re

where M is the mass accretion rate and Rip is the inner radius of the
accretion disc.

Approximately half of the hard photons are reflected back onto the
accretion disc, and most of them are absorbed by the disc (e.g. Haardt
& Maraschi 1991). The reflection albedo a for the hard photons by the
disc is typically low (e.g. Zdziarski et al. 1999). We adopt a typical
value of a=0.2 in our work, as suggested by Haardt & Maraschi
(1991); Vasudevan & Fabian (2007). The energy equation for the
accretion disc is

1
iiss ~ Oboe + 71 ~ 2) Oar = OT, (2)

where op is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and 7; is the effective
blackbody temperature of the accretion disc.

The transfer rate of energy is defined as the ratio of the heating
rate of the corona to the viscous dissipation rate in the cold disc, i.e.

f= Dor! Visi GB)

which, in principle, can be calculated based on a suitable magnetic
field generation model in the disc by assuming the corona is heated
by re-connection of the field (Di Matteo 1998; Di Matteo et al. 1999;
Merloni & Fabian 2001, 2002; Cao 2009). However, the transfer of
the energy from the disc to corona is highly dependent on the the
physical processes of magnetic field generation, buoyancy, in the
disc, and its eventual dissipation in the corona. In the work of Cao
(2009), for instance, the buoyant magnetic field is derived using an
angular momentum equation that includes a specific magnetic stress
tensor, which is then used to calculate the power dissipated in the
corona and thus the value of f. Since the details of these magnetic
processes remain highly uncertain, and to avoid being constrained
by a particular unverified model, we treat f as a free input parameter
in this work, which is similar to some previous works (e.g. Haardt
& Maraschi 1991; Haardt & Maraschi 1993; Svensson & Zdziarski
1994). Consequently the explicit angular momentum equation is not
required for our calculations.

The equation of state for the plasma in the corona can be expressed
as

p= >) mkT; + nekTe + Pag, @)
J

where the summation is over all ion species and Pmag is the mag-
netic pressure in the corona. We assume that the gas consists of 3/4
hydrogen and 1/4 helium by mass, such that ny = 12ne/14 and
Nye = ne /14. Furthermore, the temperatures of hydrogen and helium
ions are assumed to be equal, i.e., Ty = Te = Tj. In this work,
the magnetic pressure is assumed to remain equal to the gas pressure
(e.g. Liu et al. 2002, 2003; Cao 2009). The sound speed in the corona
and the corresponding vertical scale height are defined as

respectively, where f is the ratio of the magnetic pressure to the
gas pressure and £ = | is adopted in the calculations and py =
1.23, we = 1.14 are the mean molecular weights of ions and electrons,
respectively.

The two-temperature plasma is cooling predominantly through
electron radiation due to the significant mass difference between
ions and electrons. The energy transferred from ions to electrons
via Coulomb collisions (e.g. Stepney & Guilbert 1983). It was also
suggested that the strong magnetic fields in the corona can efficiently
heat the electrons through magnetic reconnection (e.g. Galeev et al.
1979; Bisnovatyi-Kogan & Lovelace 1997, 2000). Thus, the energy
equation for the corona can be written as

QVor = Vie + FQeor (7)

where 6 is a parameter that accounts for the additional heating ratio
due to magnetic reconnection. In this work, we adopt 6 = 0.5 (e.g.
Cao 2009).

We assume that ions and electrons in the corona are always in
thermal equilibrium, following a relativistic Maxwellian distribution
developed by Jiittner (1911):

where 0, = kT./m,c? is the dimensionless temperature of electrons.

where 6; = kT,/Aympc? are the dimensionless temperatures of the

of the ions, respectively. In this work, log A = 20 is adopted (e.g.
Stepney & Guilbert 1983; Zdziarski 1998; Cao 2009).

The emission of synchrotron and bremsstrahlung radiation of the
corona is always small, which is negligible compared to radiation
due to inverse Compton scattering (e.g. Cao 2009; Schnittman et al.
2013). However, bremsstrahlung emission may contribute signifi-
cantly in the hard X-ray band, which may set a constraint on the elec-
tron temperature 7, in the corona with observations. So we include

both these two in the energy equation of the corona (e.g. Kawaguchi
et al. 2001), i-e.,

Qeor = Qeomp + Qpr- (10)

In the cases of our interest, @. is always less than 1, so electron-
electron bremsstrahlung can be neglected compared to electron-
ion bremsstrahlung. According to Bethe & Heitler (1934); Step-

ney & Guilbert (1983); Heitler (1984), the emissivity of thermal
bremsstrahlung is given by

where w = hv/mec? is the dimensionless photon energy, and

do /dw is the Bethe-Heitler cross-section. Manmoto et al. (1997)
solved the radiative transfer equation for parallel slab and found the
bremsstrahlung spectrum emitted per unit surface area can be ex-
pressed as:

Fix (v) = aby [! — exp (-2v3ry)
where B,, is the Planck function, and Tt; = \zHy,/2. The total
bremsstrahlung cooling rate Q;. in Equation (10) is then obtained
by integrating F,,(v) over all frequencies.

For inverse Compton scattering, we follow Coppi & Blandford
(1990) and Kino et al. (2000) to compute the radiation spectrum.
The spectrum for the n-th scattering event is given by:

, (12)

where R(w, y) is the scattering rate between photons and electrons
and P(w;w’, y) is the energy distribution of the scattered photon. In
our calculations, we approximate P(w; w’, y) using a delta function
6 [w — (w(w’, y))]. The total inverse Compton spectrum is given by:

where tT = oyneH is the electron scattering optical depth of the
corona and P,,(t) = e~‘r"/n! is the Poisson distribution for the
probability distribution of photon-electron scattering events (e.g.
Esin et al. 1996; Kino et al. 2000).

In the context of our disc-corona system, the incident photon spec-
trum Fin(v) is given by the thermal radiation from the underlying
accretion disc and the thermal bremsstrahlung radiation, which is
generated within the corona itself, i.e.

Fin(v) = Fo(v) = Faise(v) + For(). (5)

And the total inverse Compton scattering cooling rate Qcjmp is given
by

Qeomp = [ Feomp(v) + (€~* = 1) Fin(v)dv. (16)

It has been found that the radiation emitted from the surface of
the accretion disc is not a perfect blackbody spectrum. The presence
of heated gas at the disc’s surface results in radiation in the high-
energy bands that exceeds the blackbody radiation (e.g. Hubeny et al.
2001). Chiang (2002) proposed a temperature-dependent frequency
correction factor, i.e., a hardening factor,

where foo = 2.3, Vp = 2.82kT,/h, and vy, = Av =5x 10'5Hz. The

We also need to know the temperature of the ions in the corona.
Similar to Cao (2009), we set the ion temperature to 0.9 times the
virial temperature, i.e.,

GMpgym
T, = 0.97 ir = IR
We find that the final results of the model are insensitive to the values
of Tj.

For given values of accretion rate M and coronal energy fraction
f, the structure of the corona are determined by solving the energy
balance equations, i.e., Equations (2), (3), (7), and (10). The radiation
spectrum of the disc-corona system is given by

in which the three terms in the right side represent the radiation
from the accretion disc without being scattered in the corona that can
reach the observer, the inverse Compton scattering component from
the corona, and the bremsstrahlung component from the corona, re-
spectively. In the first term, we only consider the scattering of disc

photons, as absorption is negligible compared to scattering in the hot,
tenuous plasma. In the second term, we assume that approximately
half of the Comptonized photons are scattered upwards and are di-
rectly observed, while the other half are scattered downwards towards
the disc. A fraction of the downward radiation is then reflected by
the disc and reaches the observer. For simplicity, we assume that the
spectral shape of the reflected component is similar to the incident
one. Similar to the second term, the third term effectively includes
photons that travel directly outwards as well as those reflected from
the disc, under the assumption that reflection does not significantly
alter the spectral shape.

3 RESULTS OF THE MODEL

In this work, we set the inner radius of the accretion disc to the
innermost stable circular orbit SCO) for a Schwarzschild black
hole, ie., Rin = 6Ry, where Ry = GMpy/c? is the gravitational
radius of the black hole. The tidal radius for a solar-like star being
disrupted by a SMBH with ~ 10° Mo is approximately Rr ~ 50Rg
(e.g. Hills 1975; Hayasaki et al. 2016). For such a star in a nearly
parabolic orbit, the self-interaction of the resulting debris stream is
expected to be rapidly circularized, which leads to the formation of
a disc with a characteristic size of Rc ~ 2Rr (e.g. Shiokawa et al.
2015; Bonnerot et al. 2016; Hayasaki et al. 2016). Therefore, for
simplicity, we adopt a fiducial outer radius of Row = 100R, in our

calculations. We note that the results are quite insensitive to the outer
radius of the disc, because most gravitational energy of the accreting

gas is released in the inner region of the disc near the BH.

It was found that the radial energy advection in the accretion disc
may be important when the accretion rate is significantly higher than
the Eddington rate (Abramowicz et al. 1988). For a slim accretion
disc accreting at the Eddington rate without a corona, the fraction of
the radially advected power to the viscously dissipated power is < 0.2
(Cao & Gu 2022). For the present work, a fraction of the dissipated
power in the disc is tapped into the corona, which means the fraction
of radially advected power should be lower than that given for a

slim disc without a corona. Therefore, we focus on the case of sub-
Eddington or slightly super Eddington accretion, 0.01 < m < 2,
where m1 = 0.1Mc?/Leaa (Leaa is the Eddington luminosity). The
structure of the corona can be calculated when the values of the
parameters 1 and f, and the BH mass are specified. The structures
of the coronae are given in Figure | for typical values of the disc
parameters. With the derived corona structures, we can calculate the
spectra of the disc-corona systems accordingly, which are given in
Figure 2.

Based on the model introduced in Section 2, we computed the
structure and emission spectra of the disc-corona system for a black
hole mass of Mgy = 10°Mo and a range of accretion rates ri and
coronal energy fractions f. Figure | shows the effective temperature
profile of the accretion disc and the thermodynamic structure of the
corona. We find that the effective temperature of the accretion disc
T, increases mainly with increasing ri, while its dependence on f is
negligible. Therefore, in the optical/UV bands, the disc emission in
our disc-corona system is modified only by a factor of e~* compared
with the situation where only the disc is present.

As shown in Figure 1, the electron temperature 7, in the corona
remains significantly below the local virial temperature, which is
approximately 6 x 10!'K in the inner disc region (R ~ 6R,) and
decreases to ~ 4 x 10!°K near the outer disc radius (R ~ 100Rg).
According to Equations (5) and (6), this leads to a scale height
that increases nearly linearly with radius, ie., H o R. the electron
temperature 7, and optical depth 7 exhibit only mild radial variation
across the corona. The electron number density ng decreases roughly
as R~!, consistent with the near-constant optical depth. Compared
to the disc’s effective temperature, the coronal parameters are more
sensitive to variations in both m and f.

4 EVOLUTION OF THE ACCRETION DISC-CORONA
SYSTEM IN AT 2019AVD

In our analysis of AT 2019avd, we adopt some system parameters
from previous studies, including a redshift of z = 0.028 (e.g. Malyali

Grey shaded regions highlight the 0.3-2 keV X-ray bands. A black hole mass
of Mgy = 10°Mg is adopted.

et al. 2021), a luminosity distance of D = 130 Mpc (e.g. Wang
et al. 2023), and a black-hole mass of Mgy = 10°? Mo (e.g. Malyali
etal. 2021). The hydrogen column density is constrained to the range
Nu = (2.4—7.0) x 10?°cm-?, based on Galactic measurements by
HI4PI Collaboration(e.g. Bekhti et al. 2016) and spectral modelling
from Wang et al. (2024).

To ensure compatibility with our disc-corona framework, we focus
on the post-peak evolution of AT 2019avd following its second X-
ray maximum. Specifically, the dataset includes the majority of X-
ray spectra from Phase 3 and all spectra from Phase 4, as defined
by Wang et al. (2024), covering the transition from near- to sub-
Eddington accretion regimes. During these intervals, the optical/UV
luminosity remains consistently low. We use these spectra to probe
the structural and radiative evolution of the disc-corona system as
the source transitions from high to moderate accretion rates.

As reported by Wang et al. (2024), in addition to AT 201 9avd, three
other known X-ray sources, i.e. IRXS J082334.6+042030, 2MASX
J08232985+0423327, and IC 505, are present in the NICER field of
view. The contributions from 1RXS J082334.6+042030 and 2MASX
J08232985+0423327 are negligible during the period studied in this
work. For IC 505, Wang et al. (2024) created a spectral template
to represent its contribution (for further details, see Appendix A of
Wang et al. (2024)). We adopted this template in our fit.

In our spectral analysis, we employed the XSPEC software
to fit the NICER spectrum of AT 2019avd using the model
TBabs*zashift*disk_corona + IC 505, where disk_corona
is a pre-computed table model generated using Python. The disc-
corona system was assumed to be viewed face-on. Uncertainties are
quoted at 1a confidence level. Figure 3 shows two representative
unfolded spectra and their corresponding residuals from Phases 3
and 4, respectively.

From Figure 3, one can see that during Phase 3, the emission of
AT 2019avd dominates across the full 0.3—-2 keV band. However, at
energies near and above | keV, the contribution from IC 505 becomes
non-negligible and introduces substantial contamination. In Phase 4,
IC 505 dominates almost the entire energy band. Although the emis-
sion from IC 505 is relatively stable compared to AT 2019avd, which
exhibits variations over two orders of magnitude over 1,000 days, IC
505 still shows modest variability of up to a factor of 3 (see the left
panel of Figure Al in Wang et al. 2024). As a result, the use of a
fixed IC 505 model across all spectra inevitably introduces system-
atic uncertainties, particularly near the overlapping regime around 1

keV and above. To mitigate this, we emphasize that only the residuals
below 1 keV can reliably reflect the goodness of fit for the disc-corona
model. For Phase 4, where the IC 505 component overwhelms the
intrinsic emission of AT 2019avd, the derived disc-corona spectra
must be treated with caution. In practice, we exclude a subset of
spectra that show significant deviations from the general temporal
trend of neighbouring observations, as these are likely influenced
by discrepancies between the fixed IC 505 template and its actual
emission during those epochs. For instance, the spectra obtained on
Days 196.0 and 206.0 show significantly lower fluxes than those of
adjacent epochs, while the spectrum on Day 211.2 appears unusually
bright. In addition, the spectra on Days 235.2, 239.0, 243.1, and 248.5
are noticeably softer compared to their neighbouring observations,
with the spectrum on Day 249.0 also showing a marginal softening.
As reported by Wang et al. (2024), AT2019avd exhibits significant
variability on timescales of both hours and days. However, since our
study focuses on the long-term evolution of AT2019avd on viscous
timescales, such short-term fluctuations are not accounted for in our
model. Overall, we include 8 NICER observations in this work.

In Figure 4, we present the unabsorbed X-ray spectra and fitting
spectra of AT 2019avd in the 0.1—2 keV band, with the emission from
IC 505 subtracted. Compared to Phase 3, the fitting uncertainties in
Phase 4 (i.e., observations after Day 225.0) are substantially larger,
primarily due to the increasing dominance of emission from IC 505.
Nevertheless, we can still identify a coherent evolutionary trend from
the best-fitting model. In Phase 3, the peak of the accretion disc
emission lies well within the 0.1—2 keV energy band and corresponds
to a blackbody temperature of about 0.1 keV. The coronal emission is
characterized by a very soft power-law. In Phase 4, the disc emission
peak gradually shifts out of the observed energy band, and the X-ray
emission becomes entirely dominated by the corona. In this phase,
the luminosity below | keV decreases significantly relative to Phase
3, while at higher energy bands, there seems to be no noticeable
decline in luminosity.

In Figure 5, we present the temporal evolution of the best-fitting
parameters derived from our spectral modeling. The complete set of
best-fitting parameters is tabulated in Appendix A (see Table A1).

Although subject to large uncertainties, the coronal fraction f
shows an overall increase from Phase 3 to Phase 4. During Phase 3, f

MNRAS 000, I-10 (2025)

remains below 0.4, whereas in Phase 4, it predominantly exceeds this
threshold, indicating a growing contribution from coronal emission
as the system evolves. The best-fitting hydrogen column density,
Nu, remains relatively stable across the observations, with a mean
value of approximately 5 x 10?°cm~?. However, a closer examination
reveals a weak but systematic trend: Ny gradually increases prior to
Day 205, followed by a mild decrease shortly thereafter. In some
Phase 4 spectra, Ny reaches the lower bound of our fitting range,
2.4 102°cm7?. Despite these modest variations, the overall stability
of Nu lends confidence to the robustness of our derived accretion
rate evolution.

We calculated the characteristic photon index I in the high-energy
band (0.6—2 keV), where the coronal emission dominates, using the
best-fitting spectral model shown in Figure 4. This spectral slope re-
flects the power-law shape produced by inverse Compton scattering
in the corona and should be free from contamination by disc emis-

sion. Using the best-fitting values of mm and f, we reconstructed the
corresponding coronal properties within the framework of our disc-
corona model. Specifically, we extracted the electron temperature T.
and the optical depth 7 at a representative radius of 13.5 Rg, where
the radiative efficiency reaches its maximum.

Figure 6 shows the evolution of the coronal energy fraction f, pho-
ton index I’, electron temperature 7,, and optical depth 7 as functions
of the dimensionless accretion rate 71. These parameters display dis-
tinct behaviours in different accretion regimes, suggesting a transition
occurring in the corona as the source evolves. At higher accretion
rates (1 > 0.6), the parameter correlations are less clearly linear.
A Spearman rank correlation analysis reveals statistically significant
positive correlations for both f and t with m, and a significant neg-
ative correlation for [ with mm. However, T. shows no significant
correlation with m in this regime. Specifically, as 7 declines from its
peak value towards about 0.6, the coronal energy fraction f decreases
from approximately 0.3 to below 0.2, accompanied by an increase in
the photon index I from about 5 to nearly 7, indicating a softening of

the X-ray spectrum. During the same period, the optical depth t ex-
hibits a substantial decrease from about 0.7 to about 0.4, suggesting
a nearly 50% drop in electron density within the corona, while the
electron temperature 7. remains relatively constant. In Figure 6(a),
we also show the theoretical predictions for the si — f relation from
the model of Cao (2009), adopting different values of the viscosity
parameter a for comparison.

At lower accretion rates (ri < 0.6), the relationships between
key coronal parameters and the accretion rate become approximately
linear. Both JT. and f increase significantly as m decreases, while
the X-ray spectrum hardens (I° decreases). t shows comparatively
less variation but still exhibits a mild decreasing trend over time.
When determining the best-fitting linear relations in this regime, we
excluded the data points corresponding to Days 210.1, 232.0, 242.1,
and 244.2, as these showed anomalously high values of f which
could skew the trend analysis. The resulting best-fitting relations for
m < 0.3 are

TP = (1.7 £0.0) log rt + (5.6 + 0.0), (23)
log Te = (-0.33 + 0.01) logrin + (8.7 + 0.0), (24)
7 = (0.11 + 0.02) log rir + (0.48 + 0.02). (25)

When i falls to the lowest observed values around 0.04, I ap-
proaches a value of about 3—still noticeably softer than the typical
X-ray spectral slope of I ~ 2 observed in most AGNs (e.g. Vignali
et al. 2003). Together, these results support a scenario in which the
corona becomes hotter, relatively more dominant (higher f), and
more optically thin as the accretion rate declines in AT 2019avd.

Disc-corona Evolution in AT 2019avd_ 7

5 DISCUSSION

In this work, we utilized an accretion disc-corona model to investigate
the X-ray spectral hardening observed in TDEs at later times. Our
model successfully reproduces the X-ray spectral evolution of the
TDE candidate AT 2019avd starting from 187 days after its peak
emission. Through our modelling, we derive the temporal evolution
of key physical parameters, including the accretion rate ri and the
coronal fraction f. The results show that the accretion rate declines
as rit oc (t — 193.43 day)~!®° during the late stage. Moreover, we
find a clear anti-correlation between f and 7. Our model also allows
us to derive key coronal parameters, including the spectral photon
index I, the coronal electron temperature T,, and the optical depth
t. Our results show that when m < 0.6, IT, Te, and t are strongly
correlated with the accretion rate. Specifically, as m decreases
increases, T, rises, and t drops slightly—indicating a progress
hotter and more tenuous corona that contributes more significantly
to the X-ray emission. In the following, we discuss these results in
detail, compare them with previous studies, and explore their broader
implications for understanding accretion physics in BH systems.

Our model assumes that a fraction f of the gravitational energy
released in the accretion disc is transported into a hot corona, where
it heats electrons that upscatter disc photons via inverse Compton
scattering to produce the observed X-ray emission. For a given ac-
cretion rate 7, a lower value of f implies less heating of the corona,
resulting in a lower electron temperature T. and a softer X-ray spec-
trum. When 7 decreases, the disc’s radiative output decreases and
cooling becomes less efficient, allowing the corona to remain hot-
ter and produce harder spectra. This framework provides a natural
physical explanation for the spectral hardening as the accretion rate
decreases.

In this model, the X-ray luminosity is approximately proportional
to m, f. A decrease in ri can be compensated by an increase in f,
yielding a comparable X-ray flux. However, the X-ray spectral index
is more sensitive to variations in f, so the spectral shape provides
an additional constraint in the fitting process. A larger f inevitably
produces a harder spectrum, whereas a smaller f results in a softer
one. So, there is no parameter degeneracy in our model calculations.

In AGNs, it has been well-established that key properties of the
corona evolve with the accretion rate. For example, there exists a
strong correlation between the Eddington ratio and the X-ray spectral
index, I, where the spectrum softens as the accretion rate increases
(e.g. Shemmer et al. 2006, 2008). Additionally, the coronal electron
temperature, T,, inferred from the cut-off energies of AGN hard X-ray
spectra, has been shown to decrease with an increasing Eddington
ratio, reinforcing the picture that higher accretion rates lead to more
efficient cooling in the corona (e.g. Ricci et al. 2018).

It is found that the anti-correlation between f and ri can be
interpreted within the framework of magnetically heated corona
models (e.g. Cao 2009). Cao (2009) adopt the magnetic stress
tensor form proposed by Taam & Lin (1984), ty = Pmag =
@[Pgas(Pgas + Prad) 1/2 to calculate the buoyant magnetic fields in
the accretion disc and qualitatively explain both the si — f and ri -T°
relations observed in AGNs. We compare the theoretical predictions
for the m — f relation from the model of Cao (2009) with our results
in Figure 6(a) and find that the model can reproduce the observed
m — f relation well if a viscosity parameter of a = | is adopted.
Given that a < 1 is generally expected in accretion systems, this
result implies a stronger magnetic field within the TDE accretion
disc than that in typical AGNs. We speculate that this could be due
to a stronger seed magnetic field from the disrupted star compared to
that from the circum-nuclear gas, which is then amplified by the ro-

tational instability (MRI) during the rapid formation of the transient
disc.

The anti-correlation between the relative contribution of the
corona and the accretion rate, analogous to our si — f relation, is also
a well-established observational trend in AGNs. Studies consistently
find a strong correlation between the ratio of X-ray to bolometric lu-
minosity and the Eddington ratio, Lx,2~10Kev /Lpoi & (Lpot/Leaa)*s
with the index € typically close to —0.6 (e.g., Wang et al. 2004;
Lusso et al. 2012; Duras et al. 2020). It is found that both the photon
index I’ in the hard X-ray wave band and the black hole mass mgy
is available only in Wang et al. (2004)’s sample. In order to compare
their relation with the 7 — f relation derived in this work, we ex-
tract their data and extrapolate the 2-10 keV luminosity to a broader
0.1-100 keV band, assuming a single power-law, which serves as a
better proxy for the total coronal power Q¢or. Our re-analysis yields
a relation Lx/Lgo) « (Lect /Taga) for their sample. Assuming
mi = Lgoi/Leaa and f = Lx/Lpor, this empirical AGN trend is com-
pared with the mi — f relation derived for AT 201 9avd in Figure 6(a).
The slope of the correlation between the coronal fraction and the
accretion rate for AT 2019avd, f o ri~°-°, during the later evolu-
tionary phase when m < 0.6, is much shallower than that for the AGN
sample. It is worth noting that previous studies of the si — f relation in
AGNs have relied on large-sample analyses of different sources (e.g.
Wang et al. 2004; Vasudevan & Fabian 2007). Such approaches are
subject to significant uncertainties arising from the determination of
the BH mass in individual AGNs. In contrast, our study follows the
evolution of a single system. The slope of the derived mm — f relation
is therefore independent of the BH mass estimate, and likely provides
a more reliable probe of disc—corona coupling and evolution.

Our finding of late-stage spectral hardening with a declining ac-
cretion rate in AT 2019avd is consistent with a growing body of
evidence from other TDEs, where similar rapid hardening has been
observed on comparable timescales. Komossa (2015) pointed out
that many TDEs exhibit spectral hardening over timescales of years,
although earlier studies were often limited in characterizing this pro-
cess due to the lack of continuous X-ray monitoring. More recently,
similar rapid spectral hardening has been identified in TDEs with
much more intensive observational coverage. For instance, Wevers
etal. (2023) and Yao et al. (2025) reported rapid X-ray spectral hard-
ening on timescales of roughly 30 days in TDEs AT 2018fyk and
AT 2024tvd, which is remarkably consistent with our findings for
AT 2019avd, where IP drops rapidly from ~ 5 to ~ 3 over a similar
timescale. Such state transitions, moving towards harder spectra, are
well documented in XRBs (e.g., Remillard & McClintock 2006; Wu
& Gu 2008), and have also been identified in AGNs, where the X-ray
spectra harden as m declines (e.g., Wang et al. 2004; Shemmer et al.
2006, 2008; Risaliti et al. 2009).

However, it seems that not all TDEs follow this evolutionary path
(e.g., Auchettl et al. 2017; Guolo et al. 2024). The conditions for
coronal formation and its subsequent strengthening appear complex.
For instance, a systematic study by Guolo et al. (2024) on optically
selected TDEs found that the few cases in their sample showing
spectral hardening tended to be associated with larger black hole
masses. They observed that the corona became prominent primarily
as accretion rates dropped to sub-Eddington levels. This finding is
consistent with our results in the low accretion rate regime (i.e. 11 S
0.6). However, Guolo et al. (2024) also noted TDEs with similarly
large black hole masses that did not show evidence of a significant
corona, implying that other factors, potentially related to the magnetic
field characteristics within the disc-corona system, play a crucial role
in coronal development.

Intriguingly, it is also found that some TDEs with adequate X-ray

MNRAS 000, I-10 (2025)

monitoring but did not exhibit clear spectral hardening often showed
evidence of powerful jets or outflows in the samples of Auchettl et al.
(2017) and Guolo et al. (2024). This leads to a preliminary hypothesis
that such jet or outflow activity might suppress the formation of the
hot corona, which is beyond the scope of this work. The underlying
physical mechanism for this potential suppression is still unclear,
and a larger sample with continuous multi-wavelength observations
is needed to resolve this issue.

Additionally, while m > 0.6, the X-ray spectrum of AT 2019avd
is dominated by the blackbody component, accompanied by an ex-
tremely steep power-law with photon indices > 4. Combined with
the spectral hardening period, as the accretion rate declines from
above | to around 0.04, the power-law component remains signifi-
cantly steeper than those typically observed in AGNs or XRBs where
the power-law indices are generally much lower (e.g., 7 ~ 1.5—2.5).
However, similar steep X-ray spectra have been reported in other
TDEs (e.g., Bade et al. 1996; Komossa et al. 2004). Given that the
X-ray spectral hardness is highly sensitive to the values of mi and
f, itis plausible that the magnetic field processes are quite different
between TDE and AGN discs.

As shown in Figure 5, the hydrogen column density, Ny, exhibits
a similar evolutionary trend to that of the accretion rate. Before the
rapid evolutionary phase around Day 205, Ny shows a mild but sys-
tematic increase. This could reflect the accumulation of absorbing
material from various sources, including the inflowing streams of
stellar debris themselves crossing our line of sight (e.g., Guillochon
et al. 2014; Bonnerot et al. 2016) or the development of a reprocess-
ing layer or a puffed-up envelope characteristic of super-Eddington
accretion phases (e.g., Strubbe & Quataert 2009; Metzger & Stone
2016). The column density Ny drops sharply after Day 205, coincid-
ing with the rapid decline of 1, consistent with a sudden dispersal
or clearing of the surrounding or circumnuclear absorbing material.
Similar phenomena of rapid changes in Ny have also been found in
other TDEs (e.g., Saxton et al. 2012; Miller et al. 2015; Auchettl
et al. 2017; Wevers et al. 2019) and some changing look AGNs (e.g.,
Risaliti et al. 2005; Ricci & Trakhtenbrot 2023).

Regarding the optical-to-UV emission, our disc-corona model
predicts a luminosity of about 3 x 10*° erg s~!, which is more than
an order of magnitude lower than the value observed by Wang et al.
(2024). Moreover, Wang et al. (2023) estimated the optical-UV pho-
tospheric radius of AT2019avd to be ~ 611 — 1256Rg, significantly
larger than the characteristic size of the accretion disc inferred in
this work. These results suggest that the optical-to-UV emission in
AT2019avd is unlikely to originate from the disc-corona system. This
conclusion is consistent with the growing consensus that, in TDEs,
emission from the accretion disc itself contributes significantly to the
optical/UV band only at very late times, typically several years after
the initial flare (e.g. van Velzen et al. 2019).

6 SUMMARY

In this work, we utilize a disc-corona model to explain the spectral
hardening observed at later stages of TDEs, and we apply this model
to the TDE candidate AT 2019avd. Our main results are summered
as follows.

(i) An anti-correlation between f and m was clearly observed
when mm < 0.6. This trend is qualitatively consistent with that found
in AGNs. The shallower slope (f o 1i~°3°) compared to that in
AGNs (f  ri~°-°) may suggest different magnetic field conditions
between the two systems.
(ii) The X-ray spectra harden as the accretion rate decreases, with
T’ dropping from 5 to 3 over approximately 30 days when 1 < 0.6.
Similar rapid spectral hardening has been observed in other TDEs,
and the anti-correlation between I and si: is also observed in AGNs
and BHXBRs.

(iii) Derived from our model parameters, the corona is inferred to
become progressively more dominant (higher f), hotter (increasing
T.), and more tenuous (decreasing T) as the accretion rate declines
in the low m regime. This provides a physical explanation for the
observed spectral hardening.

(iv) In the high accretion rate regime (mm > 0.6), the electron
temperature of the corona (J.) remains nearly constant, while other
parameters show different trends with the accretion rate. Whether
this reflects a limitation of our model or a distinct physical behaviour
(e.g., related to magnetic fields from the disrupted star) requires
further investigation.

(v) Our fits reveal rapid changes in the neutral hydrogen column
density (Ny). This variability might be attributed to the accumu-
lation of stellar debris streams or the evolution of a reprocessing
layer/puffed-up envelope during super-Eddington accretion phases.
