ABSTRACT

Circumbinary configurations offer a test of planet formation in an altered environment, where the inner binary has perturbed a
protoplanetary disc. Comparisons of the physical and orbital parameters between the circumbinary planet population and the
population of exoplanets orbiting single stars will reveal how these disc perturbations affect the assembly of planets. Circumbinary
exoplanets detected thus far typically have masses < 3 Mjup raising the question of whether high-mass circumbinary planets are
possible, and also whether population features such as the brown dwarf desert would appear in circumbinary configurations like
for single star systems. Here, we report observations taken with the SOPHIE high-resolution spectrograph. These observations
reveal an mp Siniy = 20.9 Mjyp outer companion, on an eccentric (e = 0.43), 1800d orbit, which we call BEBOP-4 (AB) b.
Using dynamical arguments we constrain the true mass mp < 26.3 Mjup. The inner binary’s two eclipsing stellar components
have masses Ma = 1.51 Mo, and Mg = 0.46 Mo. Their orbital period is 72 d, and their eccentricity is 0.27. This system contains
the longest period binary surveyed by the BEBOP project. BEBOP-4 b is expected to be detectable using Gaia DR4 single epoch
astrometric measurements. Despite a large period ratio of ~ 25 : 1, the substantial eccentricities of both orbits mean that the
outer orbit is on the edge of orbital stability, and located in between two destabilising secular resonances. Should the outer
companion survive, the BEBOP-4 system appears like a precursor to several post-common envelope binaries exhibiting eclipse
timing variations where very massive circumbinary companions have been proposed.

Key words: exoplanets — binaries: eclipsing — brown dwarfs — radial velocities

1 INTRODUCTION (e.g. Bennett et al. 2016; Han et al. 2024), one has been confirmed
from eclipse timing variations (Goldberg et al. 2023), with another
38 being proposed (e.g. Borkovits et al. 2015; Beuermann et al. 2010;
Baycroft et al. 2023b; Bastiirk et al. 2023), and one has been detected
from pulsar timing variations (Thorsett et al. 1993; Sigurdsson et al.
2003). Compared to over 6,000 exoplanets known to orbit single stars,
circumbinary planet would appear rare at first sight. However, about
10 — 12% of close binaries host circumbinary gas giants (Martin &
Triaud 2014; Armstrong et al. 2014; Baycroft et al. 2024), a number

Only few circumbinary exoplanets are known. 14 have been discoy-
ered thanks to transits (e.g. Doyle et al. 2011; Orosz et al. 2012;
Kostov et al. 2020), whilst another three have been identified from
radial-velocity observations (Standing et al. 2023; Baycroft et al.
2025b,a). In addition, nine have been proposed using direct imaging
(e.g. Bailey et al. 2014; Dupuy et al. 2018), five from microlensing

which is similar to single stars (Cumming et al. 2008; Mayor et al.
2011; Santerne et al. 2016; Fulton et al. 2021).

Another rare configuration is a single Sun-like star with a brown
dwarf companion (e.g. Grether & Lineweaver 2006; Sahlmann et al.
2014; Ma & Ge 2014; Triaud et al. 2017; Carmichael et al. 2019;
Dalal et al. 2021). Dubbed the brown dwarf desert, observations
reveal that, particularly on orbital periods < 100 — 1000 days (Kiefer
et al. 2019), very few brown dwarfs exists, with the rarest being of a
mass in the range 25-45 Mjyp (Sahlmann et al. 2011; Stevenson et al.
2023). This pattern has been interpreted for companions nearer the
Hydrogen-burning limit (~ 80 Mjup; Kumar 1963; Baraffe et al. 2015)
as the tail-end of stellar formation, while near the Deuterium-burning
limit (~ 13 Mjup; Baraffe et al. 2003) those objects might represent the
high-end of planet formation, whether from core-accretion followed
by runaway gas accretion (Pollack et al. 1996; Coleman et al. 2023),
or via direct collapse (Stamatellos & Whitworth 2009). As a result,
a 25 Miup has been adopted to separate between planetary-mass and
stellar-mass brown dwarfs (Schneider et al. 2011; Sahlmann et al.
2011).

Whether circumbinary brown dwarfs exist remains a puzzle. In
two systems detected with direct imaging, Delorme-1 (Delorme et al.
2013) and VHS J1256-1257 (Dupuy et al. 2023), the companion mass
is of the same order of magnitude as the components of the binary
(possibly also in 2M1510; Calissendorff et al. 2019; Baycroft et al.
2025b), hence giving the impression they are closer to a triple sys-
tem than a true circumbinary configuration. Furthermore, in those
systems, as a well as in all other directly detected circumbinary
brown dwarfs, the brown dwarf is found at a large separation from
the inner binary, far from the short-period brown dwarf desert seen
in single Sun-like stars. The most evidenced short period circumbi-
nary brown dwarf is in HD 202206, however its nature is debated.
This system contains a Sun-like star with two companions, one with
Mp Sin ip = 17 Mjup, and me sinic = 2.4Mjup (Correia et al. 2005).
Whilst Couetdic et al. (2010) use orbital stability arguments to es-
timate the true masses are mp < 34Mjup and me < 4.4Mjup, and
thus ip ~ ic > 30°, Benedict & Harrison (2017) argue instead that
astrometric measurements made with Hubble’s fine guidance sensor
imply ip ~ ic ~ 8 — 10°, which would mean mp = 0.09Mo and
me = 18 Mjup, a circumbinary brown dwarf. Eventually Gaia DR4
astrometry should resolve this conflict, but the orbital stability ar-
guments are hard to shake and more likely than not, Couetdic et al.
(2010) are correct and HD 202206 is likely not hosting a circumbi-
nary brown dwarf.

Meanwhile, BEBOP (Binaries Escorted By Orbiting Planets) is a
project to survey nearby close binaries with radial-velocities to detect
circumbinary exoplanets. The project started in 2014, with a large
sample of low-mass eclipsing binaries, and a limited radial-velocity
precision. In the first publication of the project, we could place an
upper limit on the occurrence rate of circumbinary brown dwarfs
7 < 6.5% (Martin et al. 2019). In more recent work, we also notice a
paucity of companions with mass > 3 Mjup, found to be 5x rarer than
in equivalent single star systems (Baycroft et al. 2024). In fact, within
the confirmed transit, radial-velocity and eclipse-timing population,
only one circumbinary planet has a mass > 3 Mjup, Kepler-1660b,
with 4.9 Mjup (Goldberg et al. 2023).

In this paper, we now report the clear detection of a circumbinary
brown dwarf in a system we call BEBOP-4. This discovery is impor-
tant to better understand planet formation. Already planetary-mass
brown dwarfs are difficult to assemble in single star systems and they
are very rarely obtained in simulations of planetary system formation
(e.g. Coleman & Nelson 2016; Emsenhuber et al. 2021). However,
circumbinary planet formation is expected to be more difficult yet,

MNRAS 000, I-15 (2025)

at least in the close vicinity of the central binary, since the circumbi-
nary protoplanetary disc is anticipated to be highly disturbed and
more turbulent than for a single star. Vigorous turbulence in proto-
planetary discs typically reduces the efficiency of pebble accretion
(e.g. Rosenthal et al. 2018; Pierens et al. 2021), and perturbations
to planetesimal orbits also slow the rate of planetesimal accretion
(Paardekooper et al. 2012).

In section 2 we describe our data collection, and how radial-
velocities are extracted from the spectra. In section 3, we discuss
how we measure the masses for both components of the stellar bi-
nary. These data are modeled in section 4. We interpret and discuss
our results in section 5 before concluding.

2 RADIAL VELOCITY DATA COLLECTION

Target selection for the Southern component of BEBOP is described
in Martin et al. (2019). For the Northern survey, a brief descrip-
tion is provided in Baycroft et al. (2025a). The system, HD 111605
(a= 12:50:18.53, 6= +26:09:34.29, Vag = 9.6), with spectral type
G3, was identified by the KELT survey (Kilodegree Extremely Little
Telescope; Pepper et al. 2007), and reported as a likely eclipsing bi-
nary (Collins et al. 2018, where it is known as KCO8C10921), a false
positive transiting planet signal. Its properties made it compatible
with an EBLM (Eclipsing Binary — Low Mass; Triaud et al. 2013;
Maxted et al. 2023), like all systems observed during the first phase
of the BEBOP radial-velocity search for circumbinary exoplanets
(Martin et al. 2019). As the BEBOP-North survey catalogue was
assembled, this system received the designation EBLM J1250+26
under which name it was observed. The Northern survey started with
a short reconnaissance phase (2018-09-01 to 2019-02-28) using the
SOPHIE spectrograph (Perruchot et al. 2008) at the Observatoire
de Haute Provence (OHP), to assess the radial-velocity precision of
each primary star, verify the orbital and physical parameters of the
secondaries were in line with expectations, and to remove systems
with high stellar-activity (e.g. from a lack of variations in the bisector
span as in Queloz et al. 2001). EBLM J1250+26 was selected as a top
priority system for the BEBOP-North survey. Intense radial-velocity
monitoring with SOPHIE, for BEBOP-North, started in earnest in
2019-03-11 and are still ongoing.

By construction, the BEBOP survey runs a blind survey, mean-
ing all systems are in principle observed at the same cadence and
under similar conditions. The collected data is analysed every six
months, at the end of each observing semester to perform a qual-
ity control (remove systems with high stellar activity, triple systems
etc.), and search for candidates. When candidates are identified, they
are flagged, but not observed particularly more intensively so as to
avoid introducing an observer’s bias, however reporting candidates
remains important as a means to convince telescope time allocation
committees about the validity of continuing the survey for competi-
tively obtained telescope time.

In the case of EBLM J1250+26, around March 2020 we had no-
ticed a downward, quadratic drift in the residuals of the orbital motion
of the binary. At that time we suspected a triple system, but still within
planetary range. The COVID-19 pandemic started and observatories
all over the world closed. The OHP stopped operations entirely be-
tween mid-March and mid-May 2020, reopening quite early, but
with limited availability.As a consequence, priority was reduced on
EBLM J1250+26 since drifts can be followed efficiently at a slower
cadence. Four measurements were obtained, in 2020-05-29, 2020-
12-02, 2021-02-25 and 2021-03-03, the period during which travel
to OHP was difficult. When data were analysed, it became immedi-

incorrect systemic velocity, is actually less significant and only gets highlighted due to the presence of the main signal. In the residual map, the ‘false’ maximum

becomes almost indistinguishable from other noise structures.

ately apparent the last three of these measurements did not follow
the expected drift, and that a companion was likely undergoing a
periastron passage. An attempt to observe was made during twilight
in early August 2020, but by then the target was too low on the hori-
zon. Observations resumed at high cadence and with high priority
in 2021-11-25. Regular fits to the orbit indicated a full orbital phase
would be completed around 2024, which indeed happened. A new
periastron passage is expected in September 2025 when the star will
unfortunately be below the horizon at night.

Because of these unique circumstance, compared to other systems
of the BEBOP survey, EBLM J1250+26 (BEBOP-4) is the system
that has been the least blindly monitored.

As of 2025-03-01, we collected 84 high resolution spectra, ob-
tained between 2019-01-07 and 2025-02-27, with the high resolution
échelle spectrograph SOPHIE, mounted on the T193 at the Observa-
toire de Haute-Provence (Perruchot et al. 2008). Data were acquired
under Prog.ID 18B.DISC.TRIA (PI Triaud) and 19A.PNP.SANT (PI
Santerne). All data have been acquired in ObjAB mode where fibre
Ais placed on the target and fibre B is positioned on the sky to enable
the removal of solar spectral lines reflected by the Moon. The ob-
servations were acquired using the high resolution (HR) mode with
resolution R = 75000. Standard calibrations were taken at the start
of the night and at approximately 2 hr intervals throughout the night
to track the instrumental zero-point.

The SOPHIE radial velocities (RVs) are computed by the SO-
PHIE Data Reduction System (DRS, Bouchy et al. 2009b), which
cross-correlates the spectra with a weighted numerical mask corre-
sponding to a G2-type star and subsequently fits a Gaussian to the
cross-correlation function (CCF) (Pepe et al. 2002; Baranne et al.
1996). To enhance the precision of the SOPHIE RV measurements,
we applied the recently optimised procedures described in Heidari
(2022) and Heidari et al. (2024). These include: (1) corrections for
charge transfer inefficiency in the CCD (Bouchy et al. 2009a); (2)
correction of template (colour) effects (Heidari et al. 2024); (3) re-
moval of moonlight contamination by utilising the simultaneous sky
spectrum recorded via the second SOPHIE fiber (Pollacco et al.
2008); (4) correction for long-term instrumental drifts using the RV
master constant time series, constructed from so-called ‘constant’
stars monitored each night by SOPHIE (Courcol et al. 2015; Heidari
2022; Heidari et al. 2024); and (5) correction for short-term instru-
mental drifts by interpolating drift measurements at the exact time

of each observation, based on frequently measured drifts throughout
the night. Radial velocity data are collated into Table Al.

The 84 spectra obtained have a median SNR = 46.8 (at 5550 A)
and a median radial velocity precision of 3.4 ms~!.

3 DETERMINING STELLAR MASSES

We could assume a mass of Ma = 1.584 + 0.086 Mo for the pri-
mary star, as was obtained from a homogeneous spectral analysis
of the BEBOP sample presented in Freckelton et al. (2024). How-
ever, recently developed methods allow some of our binaries to be
transformed from a single to a double-lined binary (Sebastian et al.
2024b; Sebastian et al. 2025), to measure absolute, dynamical masses
for both components.

We use the same high resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy
(HRCCS) method as in Sebastian et al. (2024b), Sebastian et al.
(2025), and Baycroft et al. (2025a), using Principal Component Anal-
ysis (PCA) and cross-correlation in the secondary’s rest frame (with
the HARPS M2 mask) to extract the weak lines of the secondary
star. For this system, we make an additional modification whereby
any additional RV shifts caused by the circumbinary brown dwarf
companion (Section 4) are first removed from the spectra before we
attempt to detect the secondary star.

The CCF maps (Fig. 1) are fit with the Saltire model (Sebastian
et al. 2024a) to extract Kp and vey. However, the Saltire uncer-
tainties are on the fit parameters, and do not estimate systematic
uncertainty from the presence of correlated noise. To quantify the
systematic error, we use a bootstrapping analysis, where we randomly
draw 50 per cent of the data and measure the best fitting parameters
(as in Baycroft et al. 2025a). This is repeated 200 times, and we
impose that no more than 15 (out of 42) spectra can be common
between any permutation (adapted slightly from the recommenda-
tions of Sebastian et al. 2025, to allow 200 random permutations to
be generated). From the 200 fit results, we take the 1-o percentiles
around the median as the systematic uncertainty in the parameters.
The MCMC fit error is 0.207 kms~!, and the systematic error is
+2.02kms7!, and these are added quadrature.

We detect a signal with 5.8-o significance, and measure a
secondary semi-amplitude of Kp = 51.02 + 2.03kms~!, imply-
ing Ma = 1.507 + 0.152 and Mg = 0.459 + 0.028 (assuming
ipin = U[88.5,91.5]°, and following the [AU recommended equa-
tions; PrSa et al. 2016).

MNRAS 000, 1-15 (2025)

Unfortunately no primary eclipses were observed by TESS (Ricker
et al. 2015) so we cannot perform an analysis like in Davis et al.
(2024), to measure the stellar radii accurately. This analysis will
be performed once a primary eclipse has been collected by TESS,
although no new observations of this target are scheduled through
TESS Cycle 8.

We note that Ma is measured differently by different methods (see
Fig. Al). Thanks to our new measurement, we confirm the fiducial
Mg masses used by the BEBOP survey as produced in Freckelton
et al. (2024) are fully consistent to within 1-o for this system. Us-
ing HRCCS, we likely measure Ma more accurately, though at a
slightly reduced precision to that achieved through spectral analysis
and isochrone fitting, owing to the relatively low detection signifi-
cance of the secondary.

4 ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

The radial-velocities were analysed with kima (Faria et al. 2018),
using the "BINARIESmodel" (Baycroft et al. 2023a). The usual or-
bital elements are used as parameters. In addition, we fit a jitter
term to rescale the uncertainties should they need to. The model also
has an option to fit for apsidal precession, by having one additional
free parameter, w, and also includes a radial velocity correction due
the effects from general relativity (Baycroft et al. 2023a; Baycroft
et al. 2025b). We chose to let w be a free parameter. A non-zero
value would provide an additional constraint on the companion’s pa-
rameters. This model, and the fitting procedure have been validated
and used in several publications (Baycroft et al. 2023a; Standing
et al. 2023; Sairam et al. 2024a; Sairam et al. 2024b; Baycroft et al.
2025b,a).

In our resulting fit, we find a model with a circumbinary companion
is clearly preferred with a Bayes Factor BF ~ 10% over a model with
no circumbinary companion. The best fitting result for the companion
and the binary, results in residuals with RMS scatter of 10.3m sl,
this is larger than the mean uncertainty of the dataset and requires
a jitter of ~ 10 ms~!. The companion has an orbital period Py =
1g23igh3t d, and a semi-amplitude Ky = 243.7 + 6.5ms~!. All fit
parameters are reported in Table 4. The radial velocity curve for the
companion is shown in Fig. 2. The overall highest likelihood model is
plotted in Fig. A2 and the binary Keplerian in Fig. A3. The posterior
on the orbital parameters of the outer companion are graphically
represented in Fig. A4. The orbital configuration of the system is
shown in Fig. 3, where 600 random draws from the posterior are
plotted. The region shown in magenta is where the companion might
pass in front of the binary and as such a transit could potentially
happen if the configuration is right.

We use Ma and Mg from Section 3, and thus the minimum mass
of the circumbinary companion is mp sin ip = 20.9 + 1.3 Mjup, above
the Deuterium-burning limit (Kumar 1963; Baraffe et al. 2003), but
below the 25 Mjup that have been taken as the separation between
planetary-mass and stellar-mass brown dwarfs (Schneider et al. 201 1;
Sahlmann et al. 2011). Constraints on the mutual inclination between
the outer brown dwarf’s orbit and the inner eclipsing binary can be
obtained with a measurement of the binary’s apsidal precession.

0.059” yr~!, meaning that the measured apsidal rate that would be
induced by a tertiary companion is @pin = 87°42” yr~!. Figure A2
depicts the contribution of Wpin to the fit. We use Ai to represent
the difference between the binary’s and brown dwarf’s inclinations,
analogous to the mutual inclination under the assumption that the
longitudes of ascending nodes of the two orbits are equal. Assuming
the brown dwarf companion is coplanar with the binary (i.e. Ai =
0° => my = mysiniy = 20.9 + 1.3Miup), the predicted apsidal
precession (using equation AS from Baycroft et al. 2023a) is Wpin =
101.2+5.4” yr~!, consistent with the measured value.

We can use the apsidal precession constraint to obtain an upper
limit on Ai and therefore also on the true mass of the companion.
As the Ai increases, the induced apsidal precession rate decreases
and eventually becomes negative as the companion moves from a
coplanar to a polar orbit (Zhang & Fabrycky 2019; Baycroft et al.
2025b). The weighted distance between the measured precession
rate and the predicted precession rates as a function of inclination
is shown in Fig. 4, along with the corresponding masses. At? 30,
the mutual inclination is Ai < 37.5°, 0.917 < i, < 2.225 (rad), and
my < 26.3Mijup. At So: Ai < 46.7°, 0.756 < ip < 2.385 (rad),
and mp < 30.5 Mjup?- This constrains BEBOP-4b to being in the
planetary-mass regime of brown dwarfs, as such it enters the BEBOP

catalogue of circumbinary planets shown in Table A2. This constraint
also indicates that the outer orbit’s mutual inclination is most likely
below the classical Lidov-Kozai angle (39°21; Lidov 1962; Kozai
1962). We also note that the BEBOP-4 configuration is tight enough
that Lidov-Kozai cycles induced by the companion on the inner
binary would be unlikely anyway. Lidov-Kozai cycles happen when
the ratio of angular momenta Loy /Lin > 0.5 (Martin & Triaud 2016)
and here Lp /Lpin = 0.16.

We calculate detection limits for any further signals in the ra-
dial velocity data in the same way as computed in Standing et al.
(2022, 2023); Baycroft et al. (2025a). The signal of the circumbinary
companion is removed from the data, using the maximum-likelihood
posterior sample, and the kima analysis is re-run with the number of
planets fixed to 1. The resulting posterior distribution corresponds
to all the Keplerian signals that are consistent with the noise in the
data, and a 99% upper limit in semi-amplitude is calculated. The de-
tection limit is shown in Fig. 5 along with the posterior distribution
for the circumbinary Companion for comparison. The uncertainty in
the detection limit is E = a where E is the fractional uncertainty

in the detection limit for a ae period bin, and N is the number

fit parameters. Stellar masses, semi-major axes, and Kg are calculated from
SB2 analysis in Section 3 as well as the kima analysis, and all remaining
parameters are taken or derived from the kima analysis of RVs. Note that
these are mean orbital elements rather than osculating elements. Since w
evolves with time, the reference time at which the value reported is calculated
is 2459 736.088894 (BJD). This reference time is also that at which Mo and
Ao are calculated. The spectral type and a variety of alternate names for the
BEBOP-4 system are listed as well.

Based on the current parameters, we calculate the detectability of
BEBOP-4b with Gaia. Using the Gaia Observation Forecast tool*
we find that there will be up to 82 epochs of astrometric data pub-
lished in Gaia DR4. Assuming a typical epoch precision of 40 jas
(Holl et al. 2023), we calculate the Gaia SNR as in Sahlmann et al.
(2015) in which a conservative Gaia SNR = 20 is recommended as
a detection threshold. The BEBOP-4(AB) binary will have a Gaia
SNR ~ 100, and BEBOP-4(AB)b a Gaia SNR ~ 40°. We therefore

data; for the SNR of the companion to get below 20 would require that only

expect that Gaia DR4 will be sensitive to the binary’s orbit and the
brown dwarf’s orbit, allowing for measurements of the true mass and
the mutual inclination. Amongst all confirmed circumbinary planets
discovered with the transit and/or radial velocity methods, BEBOP-
4b is currently the only one which is detectable with Gaia.

5 DISCUSSION
5.1 Comparisons with other planets

Compared to single star systems, BEBOP-4 b does not particularly
stand out. The exoplanet encyclopaedia (exoplanet.eu; Schneider
et al. 2011) lists 168 objects with mass > 10 Mjyp discovered ei-
ther with radial velocities or transits, 24 of which orbit stars with
masses > 1.4Mo.

Compared to known circumbinary planets identified with transits
or radial velocities, BEBOP-4b is unique. It is the most massive
by a factor > 3. In addition, BEBOP-4 both contains the longest
binary period, and the largest planetary period in the known popula-
tion. Thanks to its large semi-amplitude, it also has the most precise
eccentricity, and is the most eccentric so far discovered.

In terms of both mass and orbital parameters, BEBOP-4 b is com-
patible with some of the proposed solutions for post common enve-
lope binaries, where eclipse timing variations appear to imply a plan-
etary companion. Some examples are: HW Vir which has claimed
companions of comparable mass but much longer orbital periods
than BEBOP-4b (Beuermann et al. 2012; Baycroft et al. 2023b);
V1828 Aql (Almeida et al. 2013; Wolf et al. 2021) and QS Vir (Qian
et al. 2010; Bastiirk et al. 2023) which have claimed companions of
similar orbital periods but slightly lower masses°. As such, BEBOP-
4 might be seen as a precursor to the companions claimed orbiting
post-common envelope binaries. The evolution of a population of
circumbinary systems from main-sequence to circum-double-white-
dwarf was performed by Columba et al. (2023) who find that 20-30%
of planets survive the whole evolution. Coincidentally, BEBOP-4A
is itself evolving off the main-sequence (near its terminal age main
sequence), and about to ignite H-shell burning, on its way to become
a sub-giant.

Gaia’s contribution in detecting new circumbinary exoplanets will
mainly be if massive circumbinary planets > 5 Mjup exist (orbiting
main sequence binaries, but also in post-common envelope systems;
SahImann et al. 2015). BEBOP-4 b reveals that some detections are
to be expected.

Protoplanetary disc masses have been observed to scale with cen-
tral mass (e.g. Pascucci et al. 2016; Andrews et al. 2018) and the com-
bined stellar mass at the centre of the system is Ma + Mg = 1.97 Mo,
uncommonly large for most planets orbiting single stars, but a fairly
regular occurrence for circumbinary planets (e.g. TIC 172900988;
Kostov et al. 2021; Sairam et al. 2024a). As such the BEBOP-4 sys-
tem is a good example of why studying circumbinary planets will
support a better understanding on how planet formation scales with
central mass. Whilst detecting a planet orbiting a single 2Mo star
is difficult (lack of absorption lines, and fast rotation), doing so by
sharing the mass between two stars makes for, in this particular case,
an easier detection.

© We note here that many claims for circumbinary exoplanets orbiting post
common envelope binaries rely on eclipsing timing variations that may have
other origins than being produced by a planetary body (e.g. Zorotovic &
Schreiber 2013; Hardy et al. 2015; Baycroft et al. 2023b).
5.2 Possible formation pathways

As mentioned in Sect. 1, the occurrence frequency of brown dwarf
companions to main-sequence stars has a distinct minimum for
's between ~ 25 — 45 Mjup, with the occurrence rate increasing
both towards the hydrogen burning limit at ~ 80 Mjup and towards
the deuterium burning limit at ~ 13 Mjup (e.g. Grether & Lineweaver
2006; Sahimann et al. 2014; Dalal et al. 2021). This bimodality sug-
gests two formation channels are at play, with higher-mass brown
dwarfs being the low-mass tail of the stellar population that forms
through fragmentation of molecular cloud cores, and lower-mass ob-
jects being the high-mass end of planet formation in protoplanetary
discs. Based on its minimum mass, and the constraint on its true
mass from the binary’s apsidal precession, BEBOP-4b appears to be
an example of the latter population that formed in a circumbinary
disc.

mass

The discussion below about possible formation scenarios assumes
that during the epoch of BEBOP-4b’s formation, a circumbinary
disc is present around the BEBOP-4 binary system, and the binary
has component masses and orbital elements that are similar to those
observed today. Consideration of the earlier evolution goes beyond
the scope of this discussion. A further point to note is that the central
binary contains a total mass ~ 2 Mo and disc masses are known to
scale at least linearly with the central stellar mass (e.g. Pascucci et al.
2016). Hence, we assume the circumbinary disc contains sufficient
mass to form a planet as massive as BEBOP-4b.

Formation in a circumbinary disc could have occurred through
fragmentation of the disc (e.g. Stamatellos & Whitworth 2009) or
core accretion (Pollack et al. 1996; Coleman et al. 2023). In the disc
fragmentation scenario, the cooling time in the disc needs to be short
and on the order of the local orbital time for a gravitationally unsta-
ble disc to form one or more bound clumps. Hence, fragmentation is
expected in the outer regions of a protoplanetary disc beyond ~ 50 au
(e.g. Zhu et al. 2012). Given that BEBOP-4b has a semi-major axis
of ap = 3.63 au, formation through disc fragmentation requires it
to have migrated inwards to its currently observed location. This is
generally expected, since simulations of clumps formed by disc frag-
mentation find that disc-driven inwards migration can occur rapidly
(Boley et al. 2010; Baruteau et al. 2011; Zhu et al. 2012). In their
study, Zhu et al. (2012) showed that clumps that grow massive enough
to open gaps in the disc dramatically slow their migration. Hence, a
plausible scenario for the origin of BEBOP-4b is formation at large
radius in a massive circumbinary disc followed by inwards migration
to its current location. However, caution should be taken. Zhu et al.
(2012) considered a coarsely sampled set of initial conditions, and the
objects that opened gaps and survived migration were more massive
than BEBOP-4b. Furthermore, a recent study aimed at understand-
ing the origins of the Delorme 1 circumbinary planet showed that
inwards migration of the planet is often reversed through interaction
with a gravitationally unstable disc (Teasdale & Stamatellos 2024).
Hence, a tailored study will be required to determine whether the
above scenario for BEBOP-4b’s formation is actually viable.

Comparing observations of transiting planets with masses in the
range 20 Me < Mp < 20 Mjup around single stars with planetary
interior models demonstrates that gas giant planets are enriched with
heavy elements, and the degree of enrichment depends on the mass
of the planet, consistent with expectations from the core accretion
scenario for planet formation (Miller & Fortney 2011; Thorngren
et al. 2016). Hence, it seems highly probable that at least some
of the observed massive super-Jovian planets formed via core ac-
cretion. If formation occurs sufficiently far from the central binary,
where its gravitational perturbations are small enough that pebble

and planetesimal accretion are not inhibited (Paardekooper et al.
2012; Pierens et al. 2021), then it is plausible that circumbinary
super-Jovian planets such as BEBOP-4b can also form through this
mechanism, with their final orbital locations being determined by
post-formation disc-driven migration (Pierens & Nelson 2008) and
the timing of disc dispersal. The formation of such a massive planet
faces significant obstacles, which may explain why these bodies are
rare compared to lower-mass planets. For example, gas giant planets
open gaps in their protoplanetary discs and for planets that exceed
Jupiter’s mass, efficient tidal truncation of the disc and deep gap for-
mation can reduce the gas accretion rate onto the planet, making it
difficult to accumulate a sufficiently massive gas envelope within the
disc lifetime (e.g. Bryden et al. 1999; Nelson et al. 2023). However,
as a planet grows beyond ~ 3 Mjup, both the disc and the planet’s
orbit can start to become eccentric (Papaloizou et al. 2001; Kley &
Dirksen 2006; Ragusa et al. 2018), reducing the effectiveness of gap
opening in quenching gas accretion onto the planet and providing the
possibility of massive gas envelopes accreting on Myr timescales.
This disc-driven eccentricity growth may also help to explain the
observed eccentricity of BEBOP-4b, although the inferred value of
ép = 0.43 is larger than the values of e ~ 0.3 that have been obtained
in hydrodynamical simulations to date. However, larger values of
€p might be achieved by varying the conditions in the disc such as
the temperature and viscosity. The driving of eccentricity through
disc interaction is attractive when considering the probability that
BEBOP-4b is coplanar with the central binary. The most likely alter-
native scenario for exciting BEBOP-4b’s eccentricity is planet-planet
scattering, and this would be expected to increase both the eccentric-
ity and the inclination relative to the binary orbit plane, reducing the
likelihood for a transit to be detected. Finally, we note that unlike the
transit-discovered circumbinary planets, BEBOP-4b is not orbiting
especially close to the instability zone near the binary (see Fig. 3),
and hence does not obviously fit the picture considered by Pierens
& Nelson (2008) and Penzlin et al. (2021) of having migrated from
further out and then being parked at the edge of the cavity formed by
the binary. However, the large mass of BEBOP-4b, combined with
the likelihood it experienced significant disc-driven eccentricity ex-
citation, likely led to significant sculpting of the disc, resulting in
BEBOP-4b and the central binary orbiting within a common cavity.
Future simulations will be required to determine what the implica-
tions of this would have been for the evolution of BEBOP-4b.

5.3 Orbital stability in the system

The proximity of a circumbinary planet’s orbit to the stability limit
can be formulated in a variety of ways, which can lead to different
interpretations. We use the parameter dsc = dp/Tstab (Baycroft et al.
2025a), where dp is the semi-major axis of the planet’s orbit and reap
is the radius of the instability zone/the critical semi-major axis. Using
the formula for the critical semi-major axis from Holman & Wiegert
(1999) which takes into account dpin, ebin. and gpin gives a value
of dge © 2.7. Instead using the formula from Georgakarakos et al.
(2024), which includes more parameters (notably the eccentricity of
the planet’s orbit) results in ase ~ 1.3 — 1.7 (the two values being
the inner and outer stability criteria defined in Georgakarakos et al.
2024). Instead of asc using the Holman & Wiegert (1999) formula,
we can incorporate the eccentricity of the brown dwarf’s orbit by
calculating rperi,sc = eae , where rperi,b is the pericentre distance of
a circumbinary planet’s orbit. This yields a value of rperise ~ 1.5.
BEBOP-4b can therefore be considered close or far from the stability
limit depending on how its eccentricity is dealt with.

Figure 6. Stability analysis of the brown-dwarf in the BEBOP-4 system
assuming coplanar orbits. For fixed initial conditions (Tabs. 4), the parameter
space of the system is explored by varying the orbital period Pinne, and the
eccentricity @inner of the brown-dwarf. The step size is 0.5 day in orbital
period and 0.005 in eccentricity. For each initial condition, the system is
integrated over 10° yr and a stability indicator is calculated which involved
a frequency analysis of the mean longitude of the ibrown-dwarf. Chaotic
diffusion is indicated when the main frequency of the mean longitude varies
in time. Yellow points correspond to highly unstable orbits, while purple
points correspond to orbits which are likely to be stable on a billion-years
timescales. The dashed black lines indicate mean-motion resonances with the
binary stars. The blue dot gives the position of the best fit solution (Tabs. 4).

system, we performed a global dynamical anal in the same way
as achieved for other circumbinary planetary systems (eg. Correia
et al. 2005; Standing et al. 2023). We used the symplectic integrator
SABAC4 (Laskar & Robutel 2001), with a step size of 0.005 yr and
general relativity corrections. Each initial condition is integrated for
100 kyr, and a stability indicator, A = |1 —n’/n|, is computed, where
nand n’ are the main frequency of the mean longitude over two con-
secutive time intervals of 50 kyr, calculated via frequency analysis
(Laskar 1990, 1993). The results are reported in color, where yellow
represents strongly chaotic trajectories with A > 10-7, while ex-
tremely stable systems for which A < 1078 are shown in purple/black.
Orange indicates the transition between the two, with A ~ 1074.

In Figure 6, we vary the orbital period and the eccentricity of the
brown-dwarf in the vicinity of the best fit (Table 4). We observe that
that the system is stable up to eccentricities around 0.5, which is
very close to the observed eccentricity (e = 0.435). Moreover, there
are some high order mean motion resonances with the binary nearby,
namely the 25/1, that also introduce some chaotic structures for lower
eccentricities. We conclude that the the best fit system (given by a
blue dot) is stable, but indeed near its stability limit, which raises
interesting questions on how this system has formed. In Figure 7,
we show how the eccentricity of the brown dwarf’s orbit evolves
over time. The amplitude of the variations in eccentricity exceed the
statistical uncertainty on the measured value of the mean eccentricity
from the kima analysis.

A recent comparison between the transit-detected circumbinary
planets, and the radial-velocity detected circumbinary planets shows
tension in their distribution relative to the stability limit (Holman
& Wiegert 1999; Pilat-Lohinger et al. 2003; Georgakarakos et al.
2024). Whilst the innermost, transiting planets are almost always
detected near the stability limit (Martin & Triaud 2014; Li et al.
2016), radial-velocity system do not seem to show such preference
(Baycroft et al. 2024). One hypothesis to explain this discrepancy is
for radial-velocity detected systems to host an as-of-yet undetected,
low mass (but large radius) exoplanet near the stability limit. In this
context, we study here whether there are dynamically stable locations

between the binary and the brown dwarf for an additional planet to
subsist, which might inform further data collections.

In order to check if additional planets can be hidden in the in-
ner system, we performed again a global dynamical analysis. We
assumed the best fit solution for the already known bodies in the
system (Table 4), and scanned all orbital periods and eccentricities
of a tentative inner coplanar planet between the binary stars and the
brown-dwarf with a radial-velocity signature of 5m s~!. We observed
that all orbits are unstable, and thus conclude that no other planet can
subsist in the inner system.

6 CONCLUDING REMARKS

Thanks to 84 spectra obtained with the SOPHIE high-resolution spec-
trograph, we discovered BEBOP-4b, a planetary-mass brown dwarf
with my sini, = 20.9+ 1.3 Mjup, the most massive amongst circumbi-
nary planets confirmed via the transit or radial velocity methods.
Based on the binary’s apsidal precession we also expect the true
mass remains < 26.3 Mjup. The circumbinary brown dwarf occupies
a 1823.57; ,¢ orbit, with a large eccentricity e = 0.428 + 0.016,
the highest yet measured amongst circumbinary planets. The binary
has masses Mg = 1.51 Mo, and Mg = 0.46 Mo, an orbital period
Poin = 72d and epin = 0.27. BEBOP-4 AB is the longest period
binary known to host a circumbinary planet detected with transit
or radial-velocities. At this stage, BEBOP-4 (AB) b is unremarkable
when compared to known exoplanets orbiting single stars, but un-
usual within the circumbinary context. Because planet formation is
expected to be affected by binarity, it is surprising that such a high
mass object could assemble. As surveys for circumbinary exoplan-
ets expand their monitoring, and thanks to Gaia, it will soon be
possible to know whether such high-mass companions are a regular
occurrence.

Stellar Mass [Mg]

Figure Al. A comparison of the mass estimates for BEBOP-4 A. The results
from Section 3 and the HRCCS analysis with Saltire are consistent with
inference from BASTA from the observed [Fe/H], Tz, and G magnitude using
the BaSTI isochrones (Hidalgo et al. 2018) with micro-physics following the
recommended science case for this mass range, and with the MIST isochrone
value reported by Freckelton et al. (2024) for BEBOP primary stars. The TESS
input catalog (TIC) mass is almost fully inconsistent with other estimates (with
a discrepancy in the median of ~ 0.5 Mo), highlighting the need to derive
accurate stellar parameters. Mock distributions are randomly generated from
values and their 1o uncertainties to visualize the degree of consistency
between estimates.
