Abstract

We present a vector-based method to balance chemical reactions. The algorithm builds
candidates in a deterministic way, removes duplicates, and always prints coefficients in the lowest
whole-number form. For redox cases, electrons and protons/hydroxide are treated explicitly, so both
mass and charge are balanced. We also outline the basic principles of the vector formulation of
stoichiometry, interpreting reactions as integer vectors in composition space; this geometric view
supports compact visualizations of reagent—product interactions and helps surface distinct reaction
families. The method enumerates valid balances for arbitrary user-specified species lists without
special-case balancing rules or symbolic tricks, and it provides a clean foundation for developing new
algorithmic variants (e.g., alternative objectives or constraints). On representative examples
(neutralization, double displacement, decomposition, classical redox, small multicomponent sets) and
a negative control, the method produced correct integer balances. When multiple balances exist, we
report a canonical one — minimizing the total coefficient sum with a simple tie-breaker — without
claiming global optimality beyond the solutions the search enumerates. The procedure applies per
reaction and extends to reaction networks via consistent per-reaction application. We do not report
runtimes; broader benchmarking and code/data release are planned.

1. Introduction

Balancing chemical reactions is a fundamental task in chemistry, with implications that extend
from education and basic laboratory work to industrial processes, computational chemistry, and systems
biology. A correctly balanced reaction equation ensures conservation of mass and charge, provides the
foundation for quantitative stoichiometric analysis, and is indispensable for simulating chemical
processes and metabolic networks [1-3]. Despite its apparent simplicity in small-scale textbook
examples, the general problem of balancing reactions — especially in multicomponent systems — remains
both practically challenging and theoretically rich.

Traditional approaches rely on algebraic or matrix-based formulations. In these methods, a
chemical reaction is translated into a system of linear equations representing atomic balances, and
solutions are derived via Gaussian elimination or null-space analysis of the stoichiometric matrix [4, 5,
6]. While mathematically rigorous, these techniques face several limitations: (i) they typically yield
rational rather than strictly integer coefficients, requiring additional normalization steps; (ii) solutions
are often non-unique, with potentially infinitely many valid coefficient sets [2]; (iii) large or poorly
conditioned systems may suffer from numerical instability [4]. These shortcomings reduce the
interpretability and practicality of such methods, particularly in educational or computational contexts
where discrete integer solutions are more natural and desirable.

Alternative approaches have been proposed to address these issues. Integer linear programming
(ILP) and Diophantine equation formulations directly enforce integrality but are computationally
expensive in the general case, with NP-hard subproblems arising in network-level formulations [7].
Heuristic and rule-based methods are sometimes applied for specific classes of reactions, such as redox
processes, but these often lack generality or formal guarantees of correctness [4].

The challenge becomes even more pronounced in multicomponent or network-level systems.
Genome-scale metabolic models, for example, may involve thousands of reactions, where even minor
imbalances in mass or charge can compromise downstream flux balance analysis [1, 8]. Automated
databases frequently contain unbalanced or partially specified reactions, requiring systematic
“rebalancing” pipelines [9, 10, 11]. Furthermore, the presence of multiple valid solutions in high-
dimensional stoichiometric spaces introduces ambiguity: which balanced form is “best” for
computation, education, or modelling [1, 2].

Taken together, these challenges point to the need for methods that (a) guarantee integer
solutions, (b) reduce ambiguity in multicomponent systems, (c) remain computationally tractable, and
(d) can be readily implemented and integrated into educational tools or computational platforms. In this
work, we present a vector-based algorithm for balancing chemical reaction networks under discrete
stoichiometric constraints. Our method operates directly in the integer space by sequentially combining
vectors of compounds across the elemental space, eliminating redundant combinations among them.
This approach ensures a finite set of primitive integer combinations, guarantees integer-valued
stoichiometric coefficients, and maintains algorithmic simplicity and scalability.

An interactive web implementation of the method is available at https://cpredictor.icfk.org/,
which we use to cross-check examples throughout the paper (accessed 15 Sep 2025).

As an applied case study, we previously illustrated the method on the classical black powder
system (charcoal-sulfur-saltpeter) [12].

2. Related Work

2.1 Classical algebraic and matrix-based approaches

The most widely taught and applied method for balancing chemical reactions is based on linear
algebra. Each compound is represented as a vector of elemental composition, and balancing is achieved
by solving a system of homogeneous linear equations. This approach, often implemented through
Gaussian elimination or null-space analysis of the stoichiometric matrix, provides mathematically
correct solutions [4, 5, 6]. However, it typically yields rational coefficients that require scaling to
integers, and solutions are often non-unique, as multiple independent solutions may exist when the null-
space has dimension greater than one [2]. Furthermore, large or poorly conditioned systems can exhibit
numerical instability, reducing reliability for practical use [4].

2.2 Integer linear programming and Diophantine formulations

To address the problem of non-integer solutions, several authors have formulated balancing as
an integer linear programming (ILP) or Diophantine system. In these approaches, stoichiometric
coefficients are constrained to be positive integers, ensuring discrete and physically meaningful results.
While this guarantees integrality, such formulations are computationally demanding, as ILP is NP-hard
in the general case. Even moderately sized reaction networks may lead to exponential search spaces [7,
13]. Despite these limitations, ILP remains attractive when additional constraints - such as minimizing
the sum of coefficients or enforcing charge balance — are required.

2.3 Redox balancing and charge/proton handling

Special difficulties arise in balancing redox reactions, where explicit electrons and protons must
be accounted for [14]. Classical matrix-based approaches must be extended with additional variables to
track charge, electron transfer, or pH-dependent protonation states [4]. While rule-based methods for
redox balancing exist, they are usually limited to specific classes of reactions and may not generalize
to arbitrary chemical systems. This challenge highlights the need for approaches that can systematically
incorporate charge and proton balance without ad hoc adjustments.

2.4 Large-scale and multicomponent systems

Balancing becomes significantly more complex in large-scale multicomponent systems such as
metabolic networks. Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) often contain thousands of reactions, and
even minor imbalances in mass or charge can compromise downstream analyses such as flux balance
analysis [1, 8, 3]. From a theoretical standpoint, the high dimensionality of stoichiometric spaces
implies that multiple valid balanced forms can exist, leading to ambiguity in selecting a canonical
solution [2]. Moreover, certain subproblems in reaction network analysis -such as identifying feasible
steady states or autocatalytic cycles -are known to be NP-complete, underlining the combinatorial
difficulty of the domain [13].

2.5 Automated rebalancing in chemical and biological databases

The importance of balanced reactions is increasingly recognized in the context of large curated
databases. In biochemical databases, systematic audits have revealed widespread imbalances in mass
and charge, often arising from incomplete or inconsistent compound representations. To address this,
automated rebalancing pipelines have been developed, leveraging both algorithmic and heuristic
strategies [10, 11, 15, 16]. These frameworks aim to ensure consistency across thousands of reactions,
but they also expose the limitations of existing balancing methods when applied at scale. The need for
robust, reproducible, and computationally efficient algorithms is therefore evident.

3. Methodology

3.1 Formal problem definition

Let E be the set of elements and S$ = {1,...,m} index the species. Let A € Z!#I*™ be the
stoichiometric (composition) matrix whose j — th column is the integer composition vector ¢,. We seek
a non-trivial integer vector k € Z™ \ {0} such that Ak = 0 ; when ionic or e™ species are present we
additionally require q™* =0 (see [5, 6]). Reactants and products are distinguished by the sign
convention on k.

The balancing problem can be formulated as the search for integer coefficients such that the
weighted sum of composition vectors satisfies the conservation of each element:

m Bros
kG = 0,

where the sign convention distinguishes reactants and products [5, 6]. Specifically, coefficients
associated with reactants are taken as positive values, while those of products are treated as negative
values, or vice versa. The objective is to find a non-trivial integer solution (K1, ..., Km) (Kz, ..-, Km) with
the smallest possible set of coefficients that ensures exact conservation of all elements.

This formulation is equivalent to solving a homogeneous system of linear Diophantine
equations. However, instead of relying on classical null-space methods or integer linear programming,
the proposed approach directly explores integer combinations of compound vectors within the elemental
space.

3.2 Vector representation of compounds
Each compound is mapped to a vector cj € Znc, € Z", defined by its elemental composition.
For example, in the system {H2, O2, H2O} with elements E={H, O}, the compounds are represented as:

Ee= 20), %= 02), to= (20.

A balanced reaction corresponds to an integer linear combination of these vectors that sums to
zero. For the above example, the equation

2: ty, + 1-0; — 2+ tao = (0,0)
yields the balanced reaction:
2H, + O2 > 2H 0.

In the proposed method, compound vectors are combined sequentially within the elemental
space, and redundant combinations are systematically eliminated. This ensures that only minimal and
unique integer solutions are preserved.

3.3 Algorithm description

The proposed algorithm balances chemical reaction systems by sequentially combining compound
vectors in the elemental space and eliminating redundant or duplicate combinations. The process
proceeds through the following steps:
1. Initialization.

- Represent each compound cjc; as an integer composition vector jG.

- Partition compounds into reactants and products according to the unbalanced reaction scheme.
2. Pairwise combination.

- Select two compounds (or intermediate combinations) whose vectors exhibit opposite signs for
at least one element.

- Form a new combination by scaling and adding these vectors such that the chosen element is
reduced or cancelled.

3. Normalization.

- Divide all coefficients of the new combination by their greatest common divisor (GCD) to
maintain minimal integer form.

4. Elimination of redundancy.

- Check whether the resulting combination is equivalent to an already existing one (up to scalar
multiplication).

- If so, discard the duplicate. Otherwise, add it to the set of candidate combinations.

5. Iteration.
- Repeat steps (2)-(4) until either (a) a balanced vector (all zeros) is obtained, or (b) no new non-
redundant combinations can be generated.

6. Output.

- The algorithm terminates with a finite set of unique, minimal integer-balanced reactions.
Pseudocode (draft)

Input: Set of compounds {c), c2, ..., cm}, each represented as vector in Z*n

Initialize:
S< {ci,c2,...,cm} # starting set of vectors
Balanced — @

Repeat:
NewSet — @
For each pair (u, v) in S:
if u and v have at least one element with opposite sign:
w < linear_combination(u, v) # cancel selected element
w < normalize(w) # divide by GCD
if not equivalent_to_existing(w, S U Balanced):
if is_balanced(w):
Balanced <— Balanced U {w}
else:
NewSet < NewSet U {w}
If NewSet = @:
break
S <—SU NewSet

Output: Balanced

3.4 Theoretical properties

(a) Correctness. At each step, compound vectors are combined through integer linear
operations. Since each compound vector G € Z”, and the algorithm only applies addition, subtraction,
and integer scaling, all intermediate and final results remain integer vectors. The normalization step
ensures that each combination is reduced to its minimal integer form. A solution is accepted as balanced
only if the resulting vector is the zero vector, which directly encodes conservation of all elements.

(b) Termination. The algorithm generates new vectors only when at least one elemental
imbalance can be reduced or cancelled. Each new combination is checked for redundancy (scalar
equivalence to an existing vector). Since the number of distinct integer vectors with bounded elemental
counts is finite, and redundant vectors are eliminated, the algorithm cannot run indefinitely. It will either
converge to a balanced equation or exhaust all non-redundant combinations, proving the absence of a
solution within the given compound set.

(c) Minimality of solutions. By applying normalization at every step (division by the greatest
common divisor), all coefficients are maintained in their smallest integer form. Moreover, duplicates
and scalar multiples are eliminated, ensuring that only unique primitive integer combinations are
preserved. While multiple independent balanced solutions may exist (when the stoichiometric null-
space has dimension greater than one), the algorithm ensuring that only unique primitive combinations
are retained.
(c’) Primitive normalization and scope-limited canonical reporting. Any balanced integer
vector k € Z™ is normalized to primitive form by dividing by g = gcd(|k,|,...,|km|), so that
gcd(|kj|,...,|km|) = 1. Among the balanced solutions enumerated by our search for a given species
set, we report a canonical representative by minimizing )}2,|kjl; ties are broken lexicographically on
k and then on species names. We do not claim global (L,) -optimality.

(d) Completeness within the search space. Because the method systematically explores a
finite space of pairwise integer combinations within the closed set and iterates until no further non-
redundant combinations remain, it empirically covered all balanced identities on the tested cases. We
therefore claim systematic exploration of a bounded search space, while a formal proof of global
coverage is outside the scope of this version.

3.5 Deterministic enumeration
Exact combination rule. Given candidates u, v and a pivot element e with residuals

ry = Au,ry = Avand ry, #0, tye #0,

define L = lem(|ruel,|rv.el), «= L/|ruel, 8 = L/|rvel, s = sign(Tuerv.e)-
Then w = au— sv. After gcd-normalization and orientation fix, test wfor balance and deduplication.
Pivot selection and order. The pivot e* is the first non-zero component of r (lexicographic
order on elements). Search proceeds as deterministic BFS over a FIFO frontier ordered by
(|rl1, signature).

4. Implementation

The proposed algorithm was implemented as a lightweight computational tool designed for
both research and educational purposes. The implementation focuses on simplicity, reproducibility, and
scalability to larger systems of reactions.

4.1 Data structures

Each compound is internally represented as an integer vector of elemental composition, stored
in a dictionary-like structure where keys correspond to elements and values correspond to atom counts.
This representation ensures efficient access to elemental information and supports direct integer
arithmetic. Balanced and intermediate combinations are stored in hash-based sets, allowing rapid
comparison and elimination of duplicates.

4.2 Normalization and redundancy checks

Normalization is performed at every step by dividing all coefficients of a newly generated
combination by their greatest common divisor (GCD). Redundancy is checked by testing whether a
candidate vector is proportional to an existing one already present in the search space. This guarantees
that the algorithm maintains only unique primitive integer combinations (gcd=1).

4.3 Termination conditions

The algorithm iterates until no new non-redundant combinations can be generated or until a
balanced vector (the zero vector in the elemental space) is obtained. This approach ensures finite
execution; with the deterministic pivot and BFS policy of §3.5, results are order-independent and
reproducible.
4.4 Software implementation

The method has been implemented in JavaScript, using basic integer arithmetic libraries. No
specialized symbolic algebra packages are required, which makes the tool lightweight and easy to port
across platforms. The code is modular, with functions for vector representation, pairwise combination,
normalization, redundancy checks, and output formatting.

Web demo & availability. An interactive implementation of the same deterministic
enumeration and duplicate-removal pipeline is deployed at https://cpredictor.icfk.org/ (accessed 15 Sep
2025). The demo includes several preloaded examples mirroring our test sets and allows users to verify
balances online.

The reference JavaScript implementation is not publicly hosted in this version; a public
repository will be provided in a future update. In the interim, the code is available from the
corresponding author upon reasonable request.

4.5 Example workflow
As a proof of concept, the algorithm was tested on classical reactions such as water formation:

2 H2t+ O2 > 2 H20.

where the program automatically identifies the balanced integer coefficients (2, 1, -2).
For more complex multicomponent systems, the implementation successfully enumerated the
balanced equations observed in our test sets, while discarding scalar duplicates.

5. Experimental Validation

5.1 Objectives

The validation aims to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm (i) correctly balances
representative reaction systems and (ii) consistently reports primitive integer coefficients gcd = 1) and
a canonical representative chosen by (Yj7@,|kj|) among the enumerated balanced solutions.

5.2 Test cases
We considered three categories of closed species sets (no external species introduced):

1. Canonical textbook cases (combustion, neutralization, simple synthesis) that are
human-verifiable.
2. Redox cases formulated within closed sets that include electrons and protons/hydroxide

as explicit species when required by context (acidic/basic media), consistent with the handling discussed
in Related Work (§2.3).

3. Demonstrative multicomponent sets (~6—10 compounds; 3—5 elements) that move
beyond triviality yet remain interpretable.

5.3 Baseline (null-space check)

For reference, we additionally constructed integer solutions using the classical null-space
approach [4, 5, 6]. The comparison is qualitative and limited to: (i) existence of an integer-balanced
solution and (ii) agreement with our canonical solution up to integer scaling after gcd normalization.
No runtime or memory figures are reported.
5.4 Metrics

- Correctness. Accepted iff (Ak =0) (mass); when ionic or e~ species are present,
additionally q™* = 0 (charge) [5].

- Canonical minimality (scope-limited). For multiplicity cases, we report the equation that
minimizes )@ ,|kj| among the enumerated balanced solutions; ties are broken lexicographically on k
and then on species names. We do not claim global L;-optimality.

- Multiplicity (where applicable). Whether the species set admits more than one valid
balanced equation.

normalization; in multiplicity cases it coincided with one of the enumerated alternatives (qualitative

parity).

5.6 Limitations and future work

This validation targets representative, human-verifiable closed-set cases and focuses on
correctness and canonical minimality. We do not report timing or memory benchmarks here. A broader
quantitative study (synthetic suites, larger networks, statistical summaries) is left for future work;
qualitative efficiency considerations are discussed in §6.1—6.2.

6. Discussion

6.1 Strengths of the method

The proposed algorithm offers several key advantages. First, it operates entirely in the integer
space, ensuring physically meaningful coefficients at every step. Second, the built-in normalization
mechanism maintains primitive integer coefficients (gcd=1) and eliminates scalar duplicates. Third, the
systematic combination of compound vectors within the elemental space allowing the algorithm to
avoid redundant combinations compared to naive enumeration. Finally, the method is simple to
implement: it does not require symbolic algebra packages or optimization solvers and can be realized
in any programming language that supports integer arithmetic.

6.2 Limitations

Certain limitations must also be acknowledged. In large multicomponent systems, the number
of intermediate combinations may grow exponentially, potentially increasing computational costs. The
current version of the algorithm does not employ specialized heuristics or parallel optimizations,
limiting its scalability to medium-sized problems. Moreover, balancing complex redox reactions
requires explicitly including electrons and protons as additional “compounds,” which may demand
further alignment with the underlying chemical context.

6.3 Potential applications

Despite these limitations, the algorithm has a broad range of potential applications. In
education, it can serve as an intuitive tool to demonstrate reaction balancing principles, since it
consistently produces integer and minimal solutions. In databases, it can be applied to automatically
rebalance reactions with mass or charge inconsistencies [15, 16]. In computational modelling, the
method can be integrated into larger frameworks to generate valid input for simulations of chemical
processes or biochemical networks.
Finally, in scientific computing and reaction prediction systems, the algorithm may be used as
a validation module to ensure stoichiometric correctness.

As a demonstration, the black-powder case study provides a compact multicomponent example
consistent with the present methodology [12].

7. Conclusions and Future Work

We presented a vector-based algorithm for balancing chemical reactions within closed sets of
species that returns integer-balanced solutions and reports a canonical representative (minimizing
(Xilkj|\) among the enumerated balanced solutions, §3.4(c’)). The procedure handles classical textbook
cases and redox systems by representing electrons and protons/hydroxide explicitly when required by
context, while avoiding redundant identities through normalization and equivalence checks.

Across representative cases (§5) — neutralization, double displacement, decomposition,
classical redox, compact multicomponent sets, multiplicity examples, and a negative control — the
algorithm produced correct integer-balanced solutions (mass balance Ak = 0; when ionic or e~ species
are present, charge balance q'k = 0 and reported the canonical representative (minimizing )™,|k;|
among the enumerated solutions). For reference, a null-space baseline yielded integer solutions that —
after gcd normalization — coincided with our canonical outputs in unique cases and with one of the
enumerated alternatives in multiplicity cases (qualitative parity).

This version intentionally does not report runtime or memory figures; therefore, we do not
make quantitative performance claims. Likewise, we refrain from asserting formal completeness of the
search beyond the tested cases. Thermodynamic/kinetic plausibility is outside our scope: the identities
reported here are purely stoichiometric within the declared closed sets.

Taken together, these results indicate that the method offers a deterministic and reproducible
way to obtain canonical integer balances, which is valuable for education, automated curation, and
dataset sanity-checking, and complementary to linear-algebraic null-space approaches with post-
processing [5, 6].

Future work will address (i) quantitative benchmarking on synthetic suites and larger reaction
networks, (ii) a formal analysis of coverage and pruning rules, (iii) optional thermodynamic filters and
environment (acid/basic) inference, and (iv) broader dissemination of code and machine-readable test
sets to strengthen reproducibility.
