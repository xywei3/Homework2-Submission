Model Reduction for Controlled Quantum Markov Dynamics

Tommaso Grigoletto, Lorenza Viola and Francesco Ticozzi

Abstract—We consider the problem of model reduction for
Markovian quantum systems whose dynamics are described by
a time-dependent Lindblad generator — notably, as arising in the
presence of external control. Our approach, which builds upon
Krylov operator subspaces and operator-algebraic techniques
introduced for time-independent generators, returns a reduced
model that reproduces exactly the evolution of observables of
interest and is guaranteed to be in Lindblad form.

I. INTRODUCTION

Obtaining reduced-order models that respect structural
constraints of dynamical models of interest is essential for re-
ducing the demand of direct simulation and facilitate analysis
and optimization tasks. We focus on a large class of quantum
systems described by time-dependent Markovian (semigroup)
dynamics [1, 2] and leverage a series of results recently
established for model reduction (MR) of time-independent
generators [3, 4, 5, 6] to obtain smaller-dimensional descrip-
tions of controlled, parametric or time-dependent quantum
semigroups. Our operator-algebraic approach allows for ex-
actly reproducing the expectation values of a set of target
observables and, crucially, it guarantees that the reduced
model is a valid quantum model, leading to completely-
positive, trace-preserving (CPTP) reduced dynamics.

Physically, the kind of controlled dynamical models we
consider arises in a variety of scenarios where time-local
master equations are used to describe driven Markovian
dynamics [7, 8, 9] — including the important case of peri-
odically driven (Floquet-Markov) dynamics [10] — or where
parametric families of generators are relevant — such as in
studies related to Hilbert space fragmentation [11, 12]. In
the latter case, treating these parameters as the controls, an
exact MR for the set can be obtained using our approach.
Another natural use of the proposed technique include the
study of controlled open quantum systems: for instance,
in situations where a fully-controllable system of interest
interacts with an uncontrollable (possibly non-Markovian)
bath, our techniques allow to obtain a simplified model in
terms of a smaller-dimensional bath.

Other applications may be envisioned in a variety of open-
loop and feedback quantum-control scenarios [13, 14]. In

particular, in the context of feedback quantum control, the
proposed technique can be used in combination with existing
results [6] to compute a reduced-order observer. This would
lessen the computational effort associated with the real-
time implementation of a filtering-based feedback scheme,
potentially extending the viability of the techniques beyond
what is achievable experimentally [15]. Our MR procedures
are also well-suited for control strategies that entail switching
between a finite number of generators [16, 17, 18, 19, 20].
The possibility of reducing a controlled dynamical sys-
tem is naturally tied, and in fact complementary, to the
extent the dynamical system explores the state space, and
thus its controllability properties. Controllability analyses
of Markovian open quantum systems have been developed
under different assumptions [21, 22, 23], and a general
geometric approach based on Lie semigroups has been put
forward [24, 25]. While, as mentioned, our approach builds
on techniques developed for time-independent generators
[5], a key difference in the present analysis relates to the
construction of the operator subspace that contains all the
observables of interest evolved in the Heisenberg picture.
The content is structured as follows. In Sec. II we intro-
duce relevant notation and formulate the problem of inter-
est. Sec. III contains our main contribution — the proposed
observable-based MR algorithm. In Sec. IV we illustrate the
MR procedure by studying a controlled dephasing central-
spin model, along with mentioning other possible examples.

Il. PROBLEM SETTING: CONTROLLED DYNAMICS
IN THE HEISENBERG PICTURE

We consider finite-dimensional quantum systems, with
associated Hilbert space H ~ C”, and operator space
B(H) ~ C"*", The state of the system is described by
a density operator p € D(H), where D(H) = {p €
%8(H)|p = pt > 0,tr(p) = 1}, while physical observables
are modelled as self-adjoint operators O € 8(H), O = Of.
The expectation value of O with respect to a state p is
given by (O),, = tr[Op]. In the following, we shall drop
the subscript p whenever the state is clear from context.
We describe the evolution of the system in the Heisenberg
picture, via a time-local quantum master equation of the form

O(t) = Laity (OO): (1)

Here, u(t) : R>o — U denotes the control input, that takes
values in an admissible set ¢ C R™, and L£,, is a controlled
Lindblad generator, namely, in units where i = 1, it may
be expressed in the form [2, 1]

Lu[O] = ifFfu,O] + 3 Dr...[01, Q)
~
where H, = Hi describes the Hamiltonian (coherent)
contribution to the dynamics, and the dissipative contribu-
tions have the form D;[O] = LtOL — 5{L'L,O}, with
Lu. € 8(H) being noise (Lindblad) operators. In the
case where CL is time-independent, super-operators of this
type are the generators of CP and unital (i.e., identity-
preserving) one-parameter quantum dynamical semigroups
{Ai = e&@te) },54,, resulting in CP-divisible (Marko-
vian) dynamics [26].

The above general setting encompasses several represen-
tative situations of interest. In particular, we highlight a few:

e Open-loop coherent control, whereby the dissipator is
time-independent but H(t) = Ho+H_(t), with H.(t) =
Yo, ue(t) He, and Hy € B(H) represent independently
tunable control directions [27].

e Dissipative control, whereby the strength of (some)
noise operators is modulated in time, e.g., Lu. (t) =
ux(t) Ly, possibly in conjunction with time-dependent
Hamiltonian control as above. Relevant settings include
open-loop or feedback switching control scenarios [16,
17, 18, 19, 20] or, in cases where the control inputs are
time-periodic, Floquet-Lindblad master equations [10].

« Time-dependent perturbative scenarios, whereby the
Hamiltonian and/or the noise operators are modified as
A(t) = Ho+u(t)Ai, Lun (t) = Lon t+ur(t)Li,x, such
as in adiabatic elimination-type settings [28].

Imagine we are given a finite (or finally generated) subset
of observables of interest, say, 2 = {Oj}, whose time-
dependent expectation values we wish to simulate more effi-
ciently than using the full model. Without loss of generality,
we can assume that 1 € (2. Given a state p € D(H) and an
initial observable O(to) € © at time to, the solution of (1)
is formally given by the time-ordered exponential

O(t) = Aer9[O(to)] = Te“ [O(to)], 3)
+00 t |
-y/ ar [ dtn Luts) »-- Lu(tn)[O(to)],
nao” to to

where T denotes the (Dyson) time-ordering symbol and,
compared to the time-independent case, the maps {A; 4, }
obey the more general forward composition law Ay,,oAs.46 =
Att for any t > s > to [7]. The resulting time-dependent
expectation value is (O(t)) = tr[O(t)p]. While care is
needed in ensuring that time-dependent generators respect
physical consistency conditions [8], we will assume those to
be obeyed and focus on mathematical aspects of the problem
in what follows.

By linearity of the dynamics, the ability to simulate the
observables in ( directly entails the ability to simulate any
linear combinations of them. Hence, we can also consider
to be, in general, a finite-dimensional operator subspace.

In this work, we focus on the following:

Problem 1. Given a time-dependent quantum model (1) and
a finite set of target observables Q, find a smaller (if one
exists) Hilbert space Hon which we can define a controlled
Lindblad generator L,,, a time-dependent master equation

Ot) = Lyw[O()],

and a map ® : D(H) > D(K) so that, for all p € D(H),
all t > 0, and all u(t) :Rso0 + U, we have

(O(t))p = (O})) a¢p) «

As in the time-independent case [5], the key challenge is to
ensure that the reduced generator £,, defines a valid quantum
model (indeed, a Lindbladian in our case). Satisfying this
structural requirement is in fact a challenge for any quantum
MR procedure — notably, adiabatic elimination [29] — and a
prerequisite for implementation on a quantum simulator.

III. QUANTUM MODEL REDUCTION FOR THE
OBSERVABLE DYNAMICS

A. Observable subspace

Building on the results derived in [5] for time-independent
Markovian generators, we start by defining the notion of
indistinguishable states: two states p1, 2 € D(H) are indis-
tinguishable given the expectations in Q, when for all control
signals u(t), all times and all observables O € 2, we have
(O(t)),, = (O(t)),,- The (Krylov) observable subspace is
then defined as follows:

O = span{Telo «47 (0), Vt > 0, u(t), VO ED}. (4)

The observable! subspace characterizes the states that are
indistinguishable: by linearity of the dynamics, two states
Pi, p2 are indistinguishable (given the expectations in ()
when their difference is perpendicular to 0, i.e., p1—p2 L @
or tr[X(p1 — p2)| = 0 for all X € @. Note that the
operator space @ coincides with the attainable subspace
in the Heisenberg picture. Through duality with respect
to (-,+)yg, one can also prove that @ coincides with the
orthogonal subspace to the more common non-observable
subspace, -”. The following proposition helps us to more
explicitly characterize the observable subspace @:

Proposition 1. @ is the smallest £,,-invariant (for all wu €
C™) subspace containing Q. Furthermore, let 2 = alg{L,}
denote the associative superoperator algebra generated by
the controlled Lindblad generators. Then, we have G =
span{F(O), VF € 2, VO €Q}.

Proof. The fact that @ contains 2 follows trivially from the
definition, as Telo Luny4™ = T, the identity superoperator.
We next prove that @ is £,,—invariant for all wu € C™. Given
an observable O € 2, a time t > to = 0, and a control
u(t), let O(t) = TeSo £«45(O) as in Eq. (3). Then, for any
T > and any ti € €™, we can prove that e£«7 (O(t)) € 6.
Define a modified control function

By using the forward composition property of the propagator,
At.s 0 Aso = Ato, we have:
TeSo* Lur(oy48(Q) = Teli’ Lure) 48 (eS £urs)48Q)
= e&*T (O(t)),
'The naming convention here is unfortunate, since it clashes between

the physics and the control-systems theory literature, where the world
“observable” take different meanings.
where the first term is in @ by definition. By linearity, since
this holds for any generator of @, it holds for any operator in
0, ie., ef*T 1X] € @, for all X € @. Equivalently, we can
rewrite the statement as follows: tr[e6=7(X)Y] = 0, for all
X€06,Y € 6*,tandT > 0. By expanding the exponen-
tial, we then have tr[e“*(X)Y] = 3£25 Ftr[Lk(X)Y],
which is equal to zero if and only if tr[£k(X)Y] = 0 for
all k. This implies that tr[C;(X)Y] = 0, for all X € @,
Y € G+, wor, equivalently, £;(X) € @, for all X € @ and
U, i.e., @ is £,—invariant, as claimed.

To prove that @ is the smallest £,,-invariant subspace that
contains 2, consider an £,,—invariant operator space V DQ.
Then, for any O € 2, O(t) € ¥ since

and Lyt,)---Lu(t,)(O) € ¥. Hence, O(t) is the limit of
a linear combination of operators in VY. This implies that
@ CY and thus @ is minimal.

Since @ is the smallest £,,—invariant subspace that con-
tains , we have G = span{Ly, ...Lu,,(O), VO € O}, for
all sequences of values w1,..., ux and the second part of the
statement follows.

A few points are worth emphasizing:
(i) Based on Proposition 1, it is necessary to compute
the associative algebra alg{£,,}, rather than (as one may
expect) the Lie algebra Lie{L,,} [30], which is generally
smaller, ie. Lie{L,} C alg{L,}. This difference stems
from the fact that, in our case, @ is the operator space that
contains the observables evolved in the Heisenberg picture,
whereas typically one is interested in computing the set of
evolved observables. The fact that we are also interested in
arbitrary linear combinations of evolved observables makes
the associative algebra of superoperators / necessary.

(ii) While {£,,} is not finite in general, in many cases it may
not even be finitely-generated. Fortunately, in a few cases of
interest, the set {£,,} can be taken to be finitely-generated.
Those are the cases where £, = )>;., ux(t)Lx, and include
the cases of coherent and dissipative control we mentioned
above (either modulated or switching).

(iii) In practice, to compute &, one can use the same
procedure used to compute Lie [24] and replace the Lie-
bracket (commutator) [-, -] with the associative (matrix) prod-
uct. However, computing is numerically demanding as
it requires to compute products of superoperators (whose
complexity scales as O(n°)), instead of products of operators
(whose complexity scales instead as O(n*)). Notably, in the
case where £,, is a parametric family of time-independent
generators, the observable subspace can be more easily
computed as @ = span (U,,{£*(O), O € 2, k € N}). It is
not difficult to verify that O C O.

B. Reduced controlled quantum model

By construction, the operator space @ contains all the
observables of interest, evolved in the Heisenberg picture,
for all the possible choices of control inputs u(t): as such,

it contains all the necessary degrees of freedom necessary
to reproduce the evolution of the desired expectation values.
If one were to project the original model of Eq. (1) onto @,
one would obtain the minimal linear reduced model capable
of reproducing all the necessary expectation values (O(t)),
similar to the time-independent case discussed in [5]. Such a
model, would not necessarily be a quantum model, however.
In order to ensure that this constraint is met, we leverage the
properties of operator algebras and CPTP projectors.
Specifically, we close the observable space @ to an oper-
ator algebra </ = alg{@}. By definition of alg, is the
smallest associative algebra containing @ and, because we
assumed 11 € 2), it follows that .& is unital, ie. 1 € &. Let

L= u(@ B(Hex) ® 1c.) ut
k

be the Wedderburn decomposition of & (31, 32, 5], where
H=@, Heer ®Ha,~ and 1g, € B(He,x). With this, we
can define the CP and unital projector P : B8(H) > B(H)
with ImP = & as

Poy =u|®

where W;, is a linear operator from H to Hr, ®Ho,%, such
that WW} = 1p @ len.

Note that < is isomorphic to a smaller algebra where
all the repeated copies of the blocks induced by @1g,,
are removed, that is o = @, BHen) © B(H), where
H= @,, Hex. Then the projector superoperator P can be
factorized into two CP and unital maps, R : 8(H) > 8(H),
with ImR = o&, and J : B(H) > B(H), ImJ = &:

dim(He,x)

ts) 1c. ut, (5)

dim(He,x)
I(X) = Bx @ ler,

where X = @,, Xx with X;, € B(Hr,). One can easily
verify that P,R and J are indeed CP and unital. These two
maps then allow us to compute a reduced model:

Proposition 2. Let 0 be the observable subspace as defined
in Eq.(4), and let J and R be the CP and unital factors of
the projector P onto & = alg{@}, Eq. (5). Let us further
define the reduced observables as O = R(O), for allO €Q
and Ly = JL R. Then, for any state p, any control input
u(t) and any time t > 0, we have

(Ot), = (OW) gig» with O(t) = Tele Su48(6),
Proof. First, let II denote a projector onto @. Then
O(t) = Tele Sun 4s(Q) = Helo £45110)
= TTelo Mus) "4s 11),

since @ is £,,-invariant and thus 2,1 = IIL, II.
On the other hand, we also have

(O})) s+) = tr[J*(p) Tele £us)49(Q)]
= tr[pJTelo Rum I4*R(O)].
Then, since & D GC, we have PII = II and thus
Tele Lu IRQ) = PTelo PLuiyP4sP(Q)
= HTelo Mui M4511),

which concludes the proof.

Furthermore, we can prove that the reduced controlled
generator £,, is of Lindblad form:

Theorem 1. Let & be a unital *-subalgebra of B(H), and
let R and J denote the CP and unital factors of the projector
in (5), P = JR. Then, for any Lindblad generator L, its
reduction to &, L = RLZ, is also a Lindblad generator,
that is, L: B(H) > BH) and {e%"}is0 is a CP, unital

quantum dynamical semigroup.

This result may be seen as the Heisenberg-picture version
of an analogous result, Theorem 4, established in [5]. While
the latter theorem was proven for Lindblad generators of
CPTP semigroups and CPTP projectors, the above modified
version can be identically proven by using the duality of
the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product (-, -) ;;. While Theorem 1
establishes that the reduced generator £,, is in Lindblad form,
finding the reduced Hamiltonian H,, € %(H) and noise
operators Ly,, € B(H) is non-trivial in general. We refer
the interested reader to [6, Appendix] for how to compute
the reduced operators.

Finally, note that while projecting a Lindblad generator £
onto an operator algebra is a sufficient condition to ensure
that the reduced generator is in Lindblad form, it is not
necessary in general. Nonetheless, the fact that / is the
smallest algebra that contains @ ensures that the generator

L£,, is the smallest we can obtain with this MR procedure.

C. Sufficient conditions for quantum model reduction

As we mentioned, computing (and thus @) is numeri-
cally demanding. For this reason, we next provide two easily
verifiable sufficient conditions that allow us to check whether
the model can be reduced.

Proposition 3. Let {H,} and {L,} be the controlled
Hamiltonian and noise operators associated to the controlled
Lindblad operator L,,. Then,

O Calg(@) C alg({Hy} U {Lu} U {O;}) = F.

Proof. Because ¥ is closed w.r.t. linear combinations and
matrix products, and given the form (2) of £L,, we have that
Lu(F) € F for all u € U and for all F € F, ie, F is
£,,-invariant for all u € U. 2 is trivially contained in F
and thus, since @ is the smallest £,,-invariant subspace that
contains Q, it must be @ C ¥. To conclude, we can observe
that, by definition, alg(@) is the smallest algebra containing

Also, while is an L£,-invariant algebra that contains
Q, it need not be the minimal one. Still, in terms of
numerical complexity, an important advantage resulting from
this condition is that .% is an operator algebra, and thus
its calculation involves only products of operators (with a
complexity of O(n*)), not of superoperators.

Proposition 4. Assume that the controlled Lindblad gen-
erator has the form Ly = Lo + L',, and let Oo denote
the observable space generated by Lo alone, i.e, Oy =
span{Lj(O), Vi € N, VO € Q}. Then, if Oo is L’,-invariant
for all u, alg(@) = alg(@o).

Proof. By definition, @p is the smallest £o-invariant sub-
space containing {. By hypothesis, @ is also £/,—invariant,
hence @ = Qo and the statement follows trivially.

The above result is especially relevant to settings where
a generator £p has been computed for the free dynamics
[5]; if Oo is preserved under the controlled dynamics, MR
need only be carried out for C’,. Note that, whenever the
assumptions of Proposition 4 apply, it is numerically con-
venient to compute @ rather than @, since this calculation
involves only repeated applications of the generator Lo [5].
A characterization of the generators £ that leave an operator
algebra invariant is given in [33].

IV. CONTROLLED DEPHASING CENTRAL-SPIN MODEL

Consider a central-spin model inspired by studies of
quantum decoherence [34], composed of one central spin-
1/2 (a qubit), with Hs ~ C? (denoted by 0), and a bath made
of N spins (denoted by k = 1,...,.N), that is, Hp ~ ce"

and H = Hgs@H zB. We take the free (uncontrolled) evolution
to be defined by the Hamiltonian Hp = Heo + Hint,o, with

N N

k=1

along with the noise operators Ly = yz oa, x = 0, for all
ki Lyoon JN: Here, of), £ = 0,2,y,z, denotes a Pauli
matrix acting non-trivially only on the jth-spin. We then
assume to have full controllability over the central spin’, for
instance via the control Hamiltonian H,(t) = of) uo(t) +

ou (t). Finally, we assume that the observables of interest

are arbitrary central-spin observables, i.e., Og = o{ for

GO, hence @ C alg(@) C F.

Proposition 3 provides a sufficient criterion to verify if the
original controlled model is reducible since, if F € B(H),
then we can certainly reduce it at least as much as F
(possibly more). Since this is only a sufficient condition,
however, it is possible to have reduction even if % = B(H).

L=0,2,y,z, and Q = (C?)?.
Given the definitions above (and the fact that every bath

could have equally assumed Hs, to be nonzero, e.g., Hs, +, and
complete controllability to arise from single-axis control, e.g., ui(t) = 0

where |j), with j = 0,...,2% —1, denotes the standard basis
for Hg. In the following, we take o/ = F even tough, for
certain choices of the parameters J; and yz, further MR
could arise by joining together block-diagonal elements. This
fact implies that, in this central spin model, the bath can be
reduced to a classical model, making the overall system-bath
pair an hybrid quantum-classical model [35]. The unitary
matrix that takes ./ into its Wedderburn decomposition is the
permutation matrix that inverts the order of the Kronecker
product, i.e., U € B(H) such that U(A@ B)Ut = BOA,
for all A € B(Hg) and all B € B(Hz). In this case, the
CP, unital projector onto </ is given by

Qn
P(X)=DwW XW), We = (qi © 12)U,

q=l

with (q| denoting the standard basis for C’. The two factors
can be taken to be the projector itself, i.e., R = J = P. Note
that in this case, even tough we do not obtain a reduction in
the representation of the involved operators, since R(X) €
c"*" there is still an effective MR as all the off-diagonal
blocks are not relevant for the dynamics of the observables
in ©. In the following, we denote with Xe the operator in
the qth block of the diagonal, i.e., Xq = W,XWw}.

In the new basis, the observables of interest take the form

Qn

q=l
and, similarly, the Hamiltonian and noise operators read

lexicographical order, i.e., k = 0 denotes the least significant
bit), and mq € {+1} depending on k and q.

For any initial state p € D(H) (whether factorized or
entangled across system and bath), the reduced state is then
given by J! (p) = Oi W, pW}, where only the blocks in

the diagonal /, are relevant. Furthermore, given the structure
of Hg 0 and L;,, the reduced model turns out to be equivalent
to a classical ensemble of 2 spins, each one evolving with
its own dynamics given by

for some k = 1,...,N, then alg({Ho, Hu} U {Lp, Lu} U
{O;}) is no longer diagonal in the bath basis. Nevertheless,
one may note that © is left invariant by the generator
Dz,,(O) and thus, by a trivial extension of Proposition 4,
the model can still be reduced by projecting it onto &. By
direct calculations, one can also observe that, in this case, the
reduced model remains the one described by Eq. (6) since the
reduced controlled operator acts trivially on the observables
of interest. The same reasoning also hods for other local
controlled dissipations acting on the bath along different
axes, €.g., Ty, 74, —, or even for collective dissipation, e.g.,

Ly(t) = u(t) Sp, o\") or similar.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

In this work we extended the results of [5] to the case
of time-dependent quantum Markov dynamics, for which
we are only interested in reproducing the evolution of a
set of observables of interest. The proposed MR reduction
method returns a smaller-dimensional quantum model that
exactly reproduces the expectation value of the observables
of interest and is still in Lindblad form.

While, in terms of applications, we have focused here on a
particularly simple model, for which the MR can be carried
out analytically and which results in effectively classical
Markov dynamics, several more complex applications may
be envisioned. For instance, building on MR for time-
independent generators studied in [5], the effect of arbitrary
Hamiltonian control on a central spin may be examined
in more complex dissipative central-spin models, such as
collectively-coupled XYZ models. Likewise, the introduction
of time-dependent boundary dissipation in XXZ spin chains,
for instance by time-periodic or switched control of boundary
Lindblad operators, could be of interest for non-equilibrium
many-body physics.

Finally, although in this work we only focused on
observable-based MR, the proposed procedure can be
adapted to cases where the set of initial conditions is re-
stricted to a few states of interest, thus obtaining a reachable-
based MR [5]. In this case, the optimal MR may need to be
performed on an operator algebra with respect to a modified
product, a so-called “distorted algebra”.
