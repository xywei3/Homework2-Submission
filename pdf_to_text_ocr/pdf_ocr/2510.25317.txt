Abstract

We study a family of pseudodifferential operators (quantum Hamiltonians) on L?(R";C*) whose
spectrum exhibits two energy bands exchanging a finite number of eigenvalues. We show that this
number coincides with the Chern index of a vector bundle associated to the principal symbol (the
classical Hamiltonian). This result provides a simple yet illustrative instance of the Atiyah-Singer
index formula, with applications in areas such as molecular physics, plasma physics or geophysics.
We also discuss the phenomenon of topological contact without exchange between energy bands —
a feature that cannot be detected by the Chern index or K-theory, but rather reflects subtle torsion

effects in the homotopy groups of spheres.

1 Introduction

Topological phenomena refer to properties that remain invariant under continuous deformations o:
a model. These properties often lead to particularly robust physical behaviors, which are preserve
under perturbations—for example, in the context of the quantum Hall effect. To study such models
mathematically, tools from algebraic topology are essential. In particular, the Atiyah—Singer index
theorem plays a central role by connecting topological invariants with operator theory and spectra
properties.

In this paper, we present and prove a particular case of this theorem, following the approach of [3,
Arxiv version]. We consider a family of operators indexed by a parameter f14, whose spectrum consists
of two energy bands (i.e. group of levels) separated by a spectral gap. As yj varies, a finite number of
eigenvalues are exchanged between the bands. Using microlocal analysis, we derive an index formula
(3.13) in theorem 3.11 that relates this number NV to the Chern index C of a vector bundle constructec
from the symbol of the operator, in a simple way since we get that NV = C.

This general framework has applications in geophysical fluid dynamics—for instance, in the study
of equatorial waves [11][2|—as well as in plasma physics [12]. In the remainder of the article, we first
introduce a simple family of operators exhibiting the key topological features, and then use this setting
to establish a more general index formula.

Notice that Ey is self-adjoint.

Remark 2.2. This normal form model appears in various areas of physics. For example, in [4, 5], it
is shown how this normal form provides a microlocal description of the interaction between the fast
vibrational motion and the slow rotational motion of the molecule depicted in Figure 2.1. In short,

Figure 2.1: Energy levels (in em7!) of the CD, molecule (carbon with four deuterium atoms) as a
function of the total angular momentum J € N (a conserved quantity corresponding to rotational
energy). The fine structure of the spectrum reflects the slow rotational motion, while the broad
structure corresponds to the faster vibrational dynamics. The spectrum exhibits clusters of energy
levels, with some levels crossing or connecting different clusters [4, 5, 6, 8, 13].

(4, p) represent the quantization of local coordinates on the sphere S? , which describes the rotational
motion of the molecule, while the C? space encodes the quantum dynamics of the fast vibrations of
the molecule, restricted to an effective two-level system.

2.1 Spectral flow and spectral index

The next proposition describes the spectrum of the operator defined in Equation (2.6) and exibits a
single eigenvalue that moves upward, see in Figure 2.2. This behavior defines a spectral index Vg = +1.
Throughout this paper, this elementary model will be referred to as model E.

Proposition 2.3. «Spectrum of Ey». For each parameter uz € R, the operator Ey, (2.6), has
discrete spectrum in L? (R,) @ C? given by

B,¢¢ =wtdt, n>1, (2.3)

with for any n € N\ {0}, eigenvalues and eigenvectors are

Proof. By direct computation, see [3, Arxiv version] for details.

See figure 2.2. We remark that for || > 1 the spectrum of Ey, has no eigenvalues in the interva
[1,1], this is called a spectral gap. When yz goes from —1 to 1, we observe that there is Vg = 1
eigenvalue passing through this gap. Below, in a more general model, we will see that Ng € Z is a

as the quantization? of the following matrix valued function E,.: R? — Herm (C?) on a phase space.

is called the symbol of By (also called classical Hamiltonian function in physics).

2.2 Chern index

In the next proposition, for each parameter (1,2,p) € R3\ {0}, we will consider the lower eigenvector
w (u,x,p) € C? of the 2x 2 matrix Ey, (x,p) in (2.6). Recall that this eigenvector is defined only up to a
scalar, hence only the (complex) one dimensional eigenspace F_ (1, x, p) = {AW (u,2,p), A € C} C C? is
well defined. We get a family of one dimensional vector spaces F_ := {F_ (4, #,p) C C?, (u,2,p) € R3\ {O}}.
This family F_ is called a complex vector bundle of rank 1 over the space of parameters
R°\ {0}. We are interested by the “topology” (or isomorphism class)* of this vector bundle F_.

This topology is characterized by an integer C (F'_) € Z called the Chern index. There are many
ways to define and compute it. One of the simplest is the following.

Definition 2.5. [9] We consider the unit sphere $? = {(,2,p) € R%,||(, x, p)|| = 1} that can
be decomposed as the union of two hemispheres joined at the equator S!. On each hemisphere
separately H) (respect. H), one can choose continuously an eigenvector s; (respect. sy) in F_
(but not globally on $2). Then one observe that on each point 6 € S' of the equator, s1, 52 are

related by a phase so = e’?()s1, giving a map y : 6 € S14 (6) € S!, called the clutching
function. The Chern index is the winding number (or degree, see (3.8)) of this map:

C (F_) := deg (y) € Z.

The proof written below gives more details. See also figures 2.3 and 2.4.

a more precise definition later.

represent w_ (j1,x,p). The degeneracy is at (j,x,p) = (0,0, 0).
Proposition 2.6. «Topological aspects of the symbol E,,». The eigenvalues of the matrix
E, (a,p) € Herm (C?) , Eq.(2.6), are

Ww (H,@,p) = Vp? + 2? + p? (2.7)

There is therefore a degeneracy w4 = w_ (only) for (u,x,p) = (0,0,0). To each point on the
unit sphere (u,x,p) € S? = {(u,2,p) € R3,||(u,2,p)|| =1}, we can associate the eigenspace
F_(u,x,p) C C? corresponding to the lower eigenvalue w_(j1,2,p). The Chern index of this
rank 1 vector bundle F_ is:

Cy :=C(F_) =41.

Proof. See [3, Arxiv version] for other alternative proofs. We have

q(w) := det (wld — E,, («,p)) = det ( in ee ) =w? — (2 +0? +p?)

hence gq (w) = 0 gives eigenvalues wi = +r with r := \/? +22 +p?,ie. Eq. (2.7). The eigenvectors

eigenspaces of the symbol functions (E,,) We also remark that the following equality holds true

One may wonder whether this equality is merely a coincidence. We will explain that there is a very
general theory called “Index theory” [1] which accounts for this relation called “index formula” and
holds in a much more general setting (arbitrary dimensions and nonlinear symbols in (x, p)). For this,
we need microlocal analysis. We present this more general model below.

3 General model

Here, we generalize the model introduced in Section 2. The general setting is defined in terms of
a symbol (a matrix-valued function on phase space) under specific hypotheses that ensure both the
existence of a spectral index N for the quantized operators and a topological Chern index C associated
with a vector bundle constructed from the symbol. We then prove the equality C =N.

3.1 Definitions

3.1.1 Hypothesis on the symbol

We first define the model by its symbol: a matrix valued function on phase space depending on a
parameter 4. Below, Herm(C*) denotes the vector space of hermitian matrices of dimension d x d.
There are (important but usual) conditions at infinity on the symbol that we will ignore in this article

[7].

Definition 3.1. [3, ass. 2.1]Our model H is defined from a continuous family of symbols
depending on a parameter pu € R:

Hl, : (%,p) € Re" > Hi, (x,p) € Herm(C?) (3.1)

such that, if we denote the real and sorted eigenvalues of the matrix H, (a, p) by
wy (HM, ep) S...Lwa(u, xp), (3.2)

we suppose that there exists an index r € {1,...d— 1} and C > 0 such that for every (ju, 2, p) €
R!+" with ||(,2,p)|| > 1, and p € (—2, 2), we have the gap assumption

wy (ft, 2@,p) < —C and wy41 (ps, 2,p) > +C. (3.3)

The hypothesis (3.3) is a spectral gap assumption, see figure 3.1. Clearly, the model E,, (2.6)
verifies this property with a gap constant C = 1.
3.1.2 Quantum operator

The following definition defines a family of operators H ue = Op, (H,,) depending on a parameter € > 0
from the symbol H,, given in (3.1). This is called quantization? .

°l quantum mechanics, quantization is the procedure that gives a quantum Hamiltonian operator Op, (H) from
a classical Hamiltonian function H. The parameter ¢€ is sometimes written ¢ = h as the Planck constant, and the semi
classical limit is h ++ 0, where one can get some spectral properties of Op, (H) from the classical dynamics generated by

Figure 3.1: Illustration of the assumption (3.3). On figure (a), for parameters (j1,2,p) € R x R" x R”
in the green domain, we assume that the spectrum of the hermitian matrix H,, (x, p), has r eigenvalues
smaller than —C and that the others are greater than C > 0. Equivalently, on figure (b), the spectrum
w of H,, (x, p) for any (a,p) is contained in the red domain.

Remark 3.3. One can check that in our previous model, one has Op,—; (E,,) ae E,, for the parameter

e=1.

3.2 Spectral index

In the previous subsection, we described a family of symbols (H,) eR and how to quantize them getting

a family of operators (fe) . Now, we state a theorem that defines a spectral index for the
€>0,uER
corresponding operators.

Theorem 3.4. /?, thm 2.2] A consequence of the gap assumption (3.3) is that for every a > 0
there exists €9 > 0 such that for every 0 < € < €0,

e for any ys such that 1+a < |p| < 2, the operator Fyre has no spectrum in the interval
]-C+a,+C —- af.

e for any pw such that |u| < 1+ a, the operator Fe has discrete spectrum in the interval
]-C+a,C — al that depends continuously on p,€.

Consequently one can define the spectral index of the model (Ay), by

Nu := Nin — Nout € Z (3.4)

where the discrete spectrum has been labeled in the positive order and nin, (respect. Nout) is the

Kian?

label of the the first eigenvalue below the spectral gap “in” (respect. “out”). It does not depend on
e>0.

See figure 3.2. In other words, for a sufficiently small €, the operator va] y,¢ Presents a spectral gap
when |j:| > 1. Moreover, when jz goes from —1 to 1, a finite number of eigenvalues of H, continuously
crosses the gap. The proof uses microlocal analysis, but the idea is that, for a sufficiently small ¢€, the

spectrum of A, is close to the range of H,,, so the red zone of figure 3.2. Moreover the compactness of
the ball ||(1, 2, p)|| < 1 implies discrete spectrum for H,, in that region (this is related to Weyl law or
uncertainty principle). There are two energy bands (lower and upper) and the spectral index counts
the number of states exchanged by them.

Remark 3.5. The integer Nz is continuous hence invariant under continuous variations (homotopy) in
the space of symbols given by definition 3.1. This means that My is "topological". Then if two symbols
are homotopic (one can continuously deform one to the other) then they have the same spectral index.
But the converse is not true: we will study this point later in section 4.

We now give an easy but important proposition (or remark) related to so called “K-theory”. One
can change the size of the matrix H,,(x,p) without changing the spectral index: it suffices to add some
constant eigenvalues outside of the gap:

Proposition 3.6. Consider r € N\{0} and wo € R with |wo| > C and (Hy), verifying the
definition 3.1. Then H, defined by

0 wolder

H,(x,p) = Hy(x,p) ® wolder = ( Hy(zp) 0 ) 3.5)

has the same spectral index than H,,:
Na = Nue@wolder = Nu-

More generally we have the additive property for two symbols

Nien =Nu +Ny.

Proof. The symbol woldcr gives a quantized operator Op (woldcr) = woldz2 (Rn@cr), whose spectrum
is constant eigenvalues {wo}, independent of (j,7,p). Hence the spectral flow index is Nutagr = 0.
Due to the diagonal form of (3.5) the spectrum of Op (4, 1) is the superposition of the spectrum o
Op (H,,) and Op (woldcr), hence Nin, =Nu+Naolder = Nu-

3.3. Chern index

In the previous section, we were interested in the operators Op,(H,,) in order to define the spectra

index Ny. Now, we study the symbols (Ay) ner:

Proposition 3.7. Let (H,,),ex be a family of symbols verifying definition 3.1 and let

5?” = {(u,0,p) eR", |\(u,a,p)|| = 1},

be the unit sphere in the space of parameters. The gap assumption (3.3) guaranties that for
every parameter (j1,2,p) € S?”, we have a well defined eigenspace Fry (u,2,p) of dimension r
associated to the first r eigenvalues w1...w, (direct sum of the first r eigenspaces). This family
of vector spaces is called a smooth complex vector bundle of rank r over the sphere S?”
and denoted Fy or

Fy > 8".

The isomorphism class of this bundle Fy denoted Vecte (9?") is characterized by the isomor-
phism class of the clutching function® on the equator g : S?"~! + U (r), denoted m2n_1 (U (r))
(see figure 1), i.e.

Veoh (S2") = man—1(U(r)).

“similarly as in definition 2.5 or figure 2.3. Here the equator is a sphere $?”~'

map in C” hence an element of U (r).

and the clutching is a unitary

Table 1 shows some class of isomorphism of vector bundles. We say that the vector bundle Fy is
trivial if the clutching function is homotopic to the identity. Remark that for r > 2n, Vec%(S?") is
always Z, and this is the subject of the following important theorem.

Theorem 3.8. /9/«Bott periodicity theorem (1959)» For all n,r € N\0 with r > n, we
have

Vecn(S?")=Z, — Vecn(S??-1) = 0.

When r < n, the structure of Vect.(S?") is more complicated and give rise to non trivial effects,
see this table. More details will be given in the third section.

The next proposition gives a definition of the Chern index C (Fy) from the clutching function g
of proposition 3.7. This case is significantly less straightforward than in definition 2.5, i.e. dimension
n = 1, where the Chern index simply reduces to the winding number (or degree) of the clutching
function Recall that the degree of a mapf : S™ + S™ is

deg(f):= > sign (det (Dx f)) € Z, (3.8)

wef-'(y)

which is independent of the choice of the generic point y € S™. In the case f : S! > S!, the degree
deg (f) is also called winding number of f.

Proposition 3.9. //, Section IIL.1.B, p.271] Let g: S??-! + U(r) be the clutching function of
proposition 3.7. Suppose that r >n. Then, we can continuously deform g so that Vx € S?”-1,
Gu (er) = er, where (€1,...er) is the canonical basis of C” and g restricted to C’~! C C" gives
a function g : S2’-! + U(r—1). By iteration we get the case r =n with a clutching function
g: 8°"! 5 U(n) and we define the function

fs
x — ge (e1)

The Chern index of Fy is an integer defined by

C(F):= an eZ, (3.10)

where deg (f) is the degree of f. Adding some constant eigenvalue in the symbol (as in (3.5))
does not change the Chern index:
Crestor — Cit. (3.11)

More generally we have the additive property for two symbols
Cuan = CH +CuHr. (3.12)

Hence if initially r <n, then we add a constant vector space to each fiber F(w,x,p) (as in (3.5))
to reach r = n and define C (F’) using (3.10).

Remark 3.10. A priori, formula (3.10) gives a rational number but proposition 3.9 claims that it is an
integer.

3.4 Index formula

So far, for any family of symbols (H,,),, of definition 3.1, we have defined on the one hand, a spectral
index Ny € Z and on the other hand, a topological index Cy € Z. In this section we will present and
explain the following result.

Theorem 3.11. /?, thm 2.7] «Index formula» Let.) ,, be a family of symbols that satisfies
the gap assumption (3.3). Let Ny € Z be the spectral index defined in (3.4) and let Cy € Z be
the topological index defined by (3.10). We have:

Nu = Cu. (3.13)

Remark 3.12. Concerning the first model, this formula (3.13) has been observed in (2.12).

3.5 Sketch of proof of the index formula (3.13)

As explained in [3], the index formula (3.13) relies on the index theorem on Euclidean space of Fedosov-
Hérmander given in [10, thm 7.3 p. 422],{1, Thm 1, page 252]. In this section we provide an convincing
explanation of formula (3.13) using normal forms. We proceed in two steps.

1. First, we present some elementary models denoted E (nC), for any n > land C € Z, called normal
forms, such that the phase space is (x,p) € R?”, the symbol is a r x r matrix with r large and
the model gives the Chern index C € Z. We then observe that the index formula (3.13), holds
true:

NE =Cr (3.14)

Remark 3.13. The model Eb) = £,, has already been presented in section 2. We present these
normal form models in detail in section 3.5.1 below.

11
2. Second, for any model defined by a symbol H,, (from definition 3.1), we first increase the size r
of the matrix by adding constant levels (as in (3.5)). According to (3.6) and (3.11) this operation
does not change the value of Cy, Ny. If r is large enough, the symbol H, » can be deformed
continuously to a normal form model E© with C = Cy. For this we use proposition 3.7 and
Bott periodicity theorem 3.8. By continuity, this guaranties that Na = Ng. We then deduce

that Ny = Ne , = oe =C =Cy giving formula (3.13).
3.14

3.5.1 The index formula with normal forms

We consider step 1. We consider dimension n > 1, i.e. phase space (x,p) € R” x R” and we set

z=(z%,..-2n):=2+ipEec”.

Proposition 3.14 (Normal form model E(°)), For dimension n > 1, and Chern index C = +
we define a matrix symbol of size 2"

Then for any C € Z, we define the model EGC) by direct sum of |C| copies

For this model E™), we have

Proof. We proceed with different cases.

e The case C = 0 with a constant matrix, gives fixed eigenvectors hence Cg = 0 and no exchange
of states hence Vg = 0, so (3.17) holds true.

4 Topological contact without exchange

In this last section we discuss some interesting physical phenomenon called “topological contact”
that may happen in the models (H, 1) eR of definition 3.1, if dimension n of phase space is large enough.
Consider a model (H,,) ueR given by definition 3.1. There are two cases and subcases:

1. If the vector bundle Fy defined in proposition 3.7 is trivial (i.e. the isomorphism class is
[Fu] = 0 in Veci,(S?”)), then C = 0 and NV = 0. We can perturb continuously the symbol (H,,)

-1
toward a constant matrix ( 0 ' ) (or with higher dimensions) so that we have a (big) gap
for every values of js € R, ie. we can “open the gap”. Conversely an open gap implies that the

bundle is trivial.

2. If the vector bundle F is non trivial, (ic. [Fy] 4 0 in Vecé(S?”)), then it means that the
two bands are “topologically coupled” with a “topological contact” and we can not “open
the gap”, or remove the contact between the two bands. However there are subcases:

(a) IfC 40, then VN =C £4 0 also, there are exchange states between the bands. This situations
holds if r > n from Bott theorem 3.8.

(b) If C = 0, then NV = C = 0 also, there are no exchange states between the bands. From
Bott theorem 3.8, this situation can not happen if r > n but it may happen from table 1,
ifr <nand n> 3. The simplest example with n = 3 degrees of freedom with rank r = 2,
because Vect? (S°) = Zz = {0,1}. Suppose for example that Fy — S® is non trivial and
with topological class [F] = 1 € Vect? (S°) = Z. It means that the two bands have a
“topological contact”, i.e. that we can not open the gap. Nevertheless NV = C = 0 (because
of the morphism [Fy] € Vect? (S°) + C € Z). This implies that there is no exchange of
states between the two bands but there is some small gap smaller than ,/e, i.e. that goes
to zero in the semi classical limit « + 0. We can call this a topological contact without
exchange. See figure below.

If one adds a second similar contact (at some other value of 1), then since 1+ 1 = 0 in Zg, one
recovers a trivial bundle, the two contact annihilate themselves and one can finally “open the
gap”. See figure below.

More generally these kind of phenomena may occur with models (H, om such that the vector
bundle Fy —> $2” has rank r < n, see this table of homotopy groups that exhibits very rich,
unexpected and complicated patterns.
