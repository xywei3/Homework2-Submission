Abstract

The electronic properties of carbon nanotubes are fundamentally governed by their chirality, specified by the
integer indices (n,m). The lack of a predictive theory directly connecting the architecture of the nucleation cap
to the resulting (n,m) has hindered the controlled synthesis of specific chiralities. Here, we derive a universal
topological sum rule that quantifies this relationship. We show that (n,m) is uniquely determined by the sum
of the coordinates of the six pentagons in the cap. The complete set of these coordinates, evaluated across
rotationally symmetric lattice frames, fully defines the carbon cap structure. This rule establishes that chirality
is encoded deterministically at nucleation, as any perturbation to the pentagon positions overwhelmingly leads
to a predictable, quantifiable, and entropically irreversible shift in (n,m). We further explain the preferential
formation of the (12,6) nanotube by identifying a six-fold symmetric cap with epitaxial matching to the (1, 1, 1)
catalyst facet. Our work provides a theoretical framework that redefines the field, shifting the focus from growth
kinetics to deterministic nucleation programming and paving the way toward predictable synthesis.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) hold exceptional promise for semiconductor technology due to their remarkable
electrical conductivity and chirality-dependent band gaps [1, 2]. Although the widespread metaphor of CNTs as
rolled-up graphene sheets offers an intuitive framework [3], this post-growth representation obscures the physical
origin of chirality. The chiral indices (n,m), which determine their electronic character, are mathematically defined
by a roll-up vector, yet physical determinism occurs earlier, during nucleation [4-7]. A carbon cap, a curved
dome incorporating six pentagons within a hexagonal lattice, serves as the topological seed for tube growth [8, 9].
Although the spatial arrangement of pentagons is known to influence chirality [10, 11], a predictive and quantitative
theory linking cap geometry to the resulting (n,m) indices has remained an open challenge. Here, we bridge this
gap by introducing a topological theory that establishes a direct and mathematically rigorous connection between
cap architecture and its outcome chirality, encapsulated in what we term the topological sum rule.

Topological Framework

To establish a rigorous connection between cap structure and nanotube chirality, we develop a topological frame-
work that captures the essential geometry of carbon networks. A carbon nanotube is fundamentally a two-

*zhengrong-guo@yunlinu.edu.cn
dimensional surface curved in three-dimensional space [12]. We define three basis topological vectors e;, ej, ex
(Fig. 1), and their inverses. A connection operation combines these; for example, e; - e; is a basic building block,
and any vector combined with its inverse yields the identity eg. Repeated connections form topological paths. A
closed path around a hexagonal ring, for instance, is given by:

The set S, comprising the identity, all basis vectors, their inverses, and finite combinations under connection,
contains every allowed topological path in graphene-like networks. To incorporate sublattice-mismatching defects,
we define left and right rotation operators £ and R that act on paths to introduce dislocations. These operators
act cyclically on the basis vectors:

L:e;=L(ei), ex=Lle;), e; ' = Lex)
R:e,'=R(ei), e: =Rle;), ej; = Rex)

Although S itself does not form a group, the subset generated from eo, pj; = e;-e;, and pjz = e; ex constitues
an Abelian group V = {eo, pji, Pjk,--.}*, wherein the connection operation is commutative and invertible. Within
V, we adopt the plus sign to denote the connection operation between elements.

In graphene or nanotubes, any topological path connecting crystallographically equivalent atoms (A — A or
B — B) belongs to the group V. The value of such a path is defined as the element ap;; + Spjx (with a, 8 € Z) to
which it is homotopic. This leads to a purely topological definition of chirality: for a carbon nanotube of chirality
(n,m), a closed path encircling the circumference takes the value np;; + mpjx (see Supplemental Material $1 for
detailed description of the topological framework).

Derivation of the Sum Rule

We now incorporate pentagons to transform a closed graphene path into a nanotube path. Each pentagon t
(t = 1,...,6) occupies a lattice position (nz,m,), represented topologically as nypj; + mepjx. The path from

pentagon ¢ to pentagon t + 1 (with cyclic indexing, t + 1 = 1 for t = 6) is given by:
Prstqi = (mig - nt) Pji + (mei — Me)PyKR,

Together, these form a closed graphene path summing to eo:

Peraphene = > Prtsi = €0-
ti

Introducing a pentagon—a topological kink represented by the path

—1

=k -l erlierli
Ps =ej ene; +e; -e, =e;

—breaks this closure. Although Pj-,2 connects directly to Ps, the combined path P1_,2 + Ps; cannot connect
directly to P2_,3 due to a fundamental sublattice mismatch introduced by the pentagonal defect. This topological
obstruction is resolved by systematically applying right rotations R to subsequent segments, which restores sub-
lattice registry. The complete circumferential path of the nanotube, incorporating all six pentagons, is therefore:

6

ad

Pont = > Ri (Piot41 + Ps), (1)
t=1

where R‘~! denotes t — 1 successive applications of the R operator.
Given that three right rotations invert any path, R?(P) = P~', the pentagon contributions sum to identity:
fe R'-!(Ps) =e. Substituting the explicit path forms yields:

6

Pont = SS RR’! (nepji + MUP): (2)
t=1

To simplify the expression in Equation (2), we exploit the identity P = R'~![£'-!(P)] and re-parameterize each
(nz,mz) in successively left-rotated topological spaces. This aligns all pentagon contributions into a common
reference frame:

MuPji + MUPjk = TUL! (Py) + TL (Dyn) (3)
The closed nanotube path defines its chirality:

corresponding vector spaces. (Top right) Atomic configuration of the cap and the resulting carbon nanotubes, with
the cap-nanotube boundary defined by the presence of a stable edge structure during nucleation (see Supplemental
Material S2 for details)

Equation (5) reveals the fundamental linear relationship. The Abelian group V is isomorphic to the group
generated by physical lattice vectors rn, fm. Here, pj; and pjx are their topological proxies; a left rotation £
corresponds to a 7/3 real-space rotation of the lattice basis. We therefore introduce a chiral index notation for the
cap: [(71, 771), (M2, 72), ..., (716, 7™m6)], Where each tuple (74, 7rz) represents the coordinates of a pentagon within
the lattice space (r‘,,r!,,) (Fig. 2). This leads to the final topological sum rule:

6 6

Equation (6) presents the central result of this work: the topological sum rule governing carbon nanotube chirality.
This rule dictates that the chiral indices (n,m) are determined entirely by the sum of the coordinates of the six

3
pentagons, evaluated across rotationally related lattice vector spaces. A profound implication is that while a given
cap can be represented by multiple notation sequences due to the symmetry of the hexagonal lattice, the resulting
sum in Eq. (6) remains invariant under all symmetry operations of the P6/mmm space group. This invariance
underscores the rule’s fundamental character as a universal topological law.

Discussion

The topological sum rule provides not only an intuitive bridge between cap structure and nanotube chirality but
also profound physical insight into its origin. We propose a topological interpretation in which the graphene edge
is taken as a reference state, since any closed path on its lattice is homotopic to the identity element e9. Each
pentagon, however, acts as a topological deflector, rotating successive path segments by 7/3—a direct consequence
of the sublattice mismatch introduced by the pentagonal defect. As a result, the chirality of a carbon nanotube
emerges as the coherent sum of six such discrete rotations, forming a deterministic topological imprint of the
pentagon arrangement in the cap.

The controlled synthesis of carbon nanotubes with predefined chirality remains a fundamental challenge in
nanotechnology [13-16]. Our work reframes this challenge as a problem of topological programming: although
multiple cap structures can correspond to the same chiral indices (n,m), equation (6) establishes that any change
in the position of a pentagon induces a deterministic and quantifiable shift in chirality. For instance, shifting one
pentagon from (0,0) to (1,1) in a (5,5) nanotube redirects growth to a (6,6) nanotube (Fig. 2). Restoring the
original (5,5) chirality would require compensating changes in other pentagon positions summing to (—1,—1)—a
scenario of low statistical probability in an entropy dominated regime [17]. This underscores that chirality is de-
termined deterministically during nucleation, demanding atomic-level precision in pentagon placement throughout
cap formation [18, 19].

Two distinct pathways—clone growth and solid catalyst-specified growth via chemical vapor deposition
(CVD)—enable atomic-level control over carbon cap formation. Clone growth directly programs the cap architec-
ture through molecular-scale design. For instance, chemical opening of Cgo molecules yields cap sequences such
as [(1,0), (2,0),...] and [(0,0), (1,1),...], which template the growth of (9,0) and (5,5) nanotubes, respectively
(Fig. 2) [20]. Alternatively, molecular templates synthesized through organic chemistry—such as the Co¢gHs54
molecule, which preorganizes the sequence [(2,1), (0,1),.../—can direct cap assembly to selectively form (6,6)
nanotubes [21].

Nevertheless, chemical vapor deposition using solid catalysts remains the most scalable and technologically
promising synthesis route, having already produced several nanotubes with high enantiomeric purity [22]. Among
these, the (12,6) species exhibits notable and reproducible abundance across a wide range of synthesis condi-
tions [23-25]. Although kinetic theory accounts for its rapid elongation, the preferential nucleation of the (12,6)
nanotube has remained an experimental puzzle. Here, we provide a compelling explanation for this long-standing
question through a topological framework.

Figure 3: Schematic illustration of lattice matching between nanotube caps and (1,1, 1) crystallographic facets.
(a) A homogeneous cap structure [(2, 1), (2,1), (2,1), (2, 1), (2, 1), (2, 1)] leading to the growth of a metallic (12, 6)
nanotube. (b) A modified cap [(2, 1), (2, 1), (3, 0), (2, 1), (2, 1), (3, 0)] resulting in a semiconducting (14, 4) nanotube.

A distinct category of carbon caps is defined by their six-fold rotational symmetry, corresponding to nan-
otubes with chiral indices (6n, 6m) and represented by the notation [(n,m),...]. Representative examples include
((1,0),...], (1, 1),...], and [(2,1),...]. These symmetric caps achieve coherent structural registry with (1,1, 1)
crystallographic facets of various face-centered catalysts, with all six pentagons positioned along the cap periphery
(Fig. 3a). This configuration creates favorable nucleation conditions, enabling epitaxial extension of the cap across
the catalyst surface in a graphene-like growth mode. Pentagon incorporation initiates when the expanding carbon
network encounters the catalyst boundary [26-29].

Among nanotubes with six-fold symmetric caps, the (12,6) chirality is uniquely privileged, combining optimal
nucleation characteristics with favorable post-nucleation growth kinetics. Its geometric parameters—a diameter

of approximately 1.3 nm and a chiral angle of 19.1°—promote rapid elongation [30-32].

However, achieving such well-defined growth requires precise incorporation of all six pentagons at (2,1) sub-
lattice sites (or equivalently, (1,2) sites, which yield the mirror-symmetric (6,12) chirality). Any deviation from
this ideal configuration—for example, substituting two (2,1) pentagons with (3,0) sites—deterministically shifts
the resulting chirality to the semiconducting (14,4) type (Fig. 3b). Consistent with this theoretical framework,
the (14,4) nanotube exhibits experimental enrichment under similar synthesis conditions [33]. Moreover, several
other structurally related chiralities—including (18,0), (16,2), (10,6), and (9,9)—are also enriched [28].

Notably, while the existence of highly symmetric caps can account for their enrichment, it does not fully explain
the overwhelming preferential formation of (12,6) over other chiralities. The (12,6) symmetric cap admits only two
configurations, whereas its structural variants offer substantially more possibilities—the (14,4) cap, for instance,
possesses 30 distinct configurations near this symmetry. This numerical disparity suggests that (14,4) should
be entropically favored. The fact that (12,6) nanotubes form preferentially, even against entropic predictions,
indicates that an underlying physical mechanism selectively stabilizes its specific cap architecture. This finding
underscores the need for a theoretical framework describing pentagon formation dynamics on catalyst surfaces—a
crucial step toward predictive cap engineering [18, 34].

Furthermore, our topological framework establishes a pathway for the rational design of carbon-based het-
erostructures, including intramolecular nanotube junctions and graphene-nanotube hybrids (see Supplemental
Material $3). By strategically incorporating pentagonal and heptagonal defects into the hexagonal carbon lattice,
a diverse range of target architectures can be systematically constructed. Our approach thus provides a versatile
and predictive tool for the atomic-scale engineering of complex carbon nanomaterials.

Conclusion

We have established a universal topological sum rule that governs the chirality of carbon nanotubes. The chiral
indices (n,m) are given by the direct sum of the six pentagon coordinates in the nucleation cap, evaluated in
rotationally symmetric coordinate frames. Each pentagon serves as a topological deflector, rotating successive
growth directions by 7/3, such that the net chirality arises as the deterministic sum of these discrete rotations. This
result demonstrates that chirality is encoded deterministically at the nucleation stage. Consequently, controlling
nanotube chirality reduces to the topological programming of the cap architecture—which fundamentally requires
precise pentagon placement to achieve predictable synthesis. As a key illustration, we identify a six-fold symmetric
(12,6) cap exhibiting perfect lattice matching with the (1,1,1) catalyst facet, thereby explaining its enrichment
in experiments. Our work establishes a fundamental principle and a concrete design rule for the atomic-scale
engineering of carbon nanotube chirality, advancing the field into a new stage of controlled nucleation.
