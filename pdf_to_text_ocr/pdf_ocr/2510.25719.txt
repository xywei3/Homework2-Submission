We study the interplay of symmetries and Gaussianity in bosonic systems, under closed and
open dynamics, and develop a resource theory of Gaussian asymmetry. Specifically, we focus on
Gaussian symmetry-respecting (covariant) operations, which serve as the free operations in this
framework. We prove that any such operation can be realized via Gaussian Hamiltonians that
respect the symmetry under consideration, coupled to an environment prepared in a symmetry-
respecting pure Gaussian state. We further identify a family of tractable monotone functions of
states that remain non-increasing under Gaussian symmetry-respecting dynamics, and are exactly
conserved in closed systems. We demonstrate that these monotones are not generally respected
under non-Gaussian symmetry-respecting dynamics. Along the way, we provide several technical
results of independent interest to the quantum information and optics communities, including a
new approach to the Stinespring dilation theorem, and an extension of Williamson’s theorem for
the simultaneous normal mode decomposition of Gaussian systems and conserved charges.

I. INTRODUCTION

Symmetries lie at the foundation of the fundamental
principles of nature. Noether’s theorem, for instance, es-
tablishes that every continuous symmetry gives rise to a
conservation law [1]. In practice, exploiting symmetries
often simplifies the characterization of a system’s dynam-
ics. Conversely, if one has access only to physical opera-
tions that respect a certain symmetry, e.g. spin rotations
in the 2 direction, it becomes impossible to transform
symmetric states, e.g. spin-Z particles, into asymmet-
ric states, e.g. spin-% particles. From this perspective,
modern treatments of symmetry in quantum physics [2—
8] view asymmetry as a resource that permits reaching
certain quantum states that would otherwise remain in-
accessible under symmetric dynamics. This resource-
heoretic approach [9, 10] has uncovered deep links be-
ween asymmetry and various areas of quantum physics,
such as quantum coherence [6, 11-17], quantum metrol-
ogy [12, 18-21], and athermality in quantum thermody-
namics [14-16, 22-25]. More recently, in the context of
many-body systems, the resource theory of asymmetry
has been shown to be useful for understanding thermal
relaxation processes in quantum systems, and in particu-
ar for elucidating the Mpemba effect [26, 27]. However,
he resource theory of asymmetry has been developed
rimarily for finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, leaving
he subtleties of continuous-variable (CV) systems with
infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces largely unaddressed.

An important class of CV systems that is ubiqui-
ous in nature is the class of bosonic Gaussian sys-
ems, i.e. bosonic systems described by Gaussian states
and Gaussian dynamics. The Gaussian formalism often
sufficiently captures or approximates quantum correla-

tions [28] which are crucial in quantum optics, field the-
ories and solid state physics [29].

Gaussian systems are also ubiquitous in the labora-
tory, as they can be efficiently prepared and manipu-
lated [30-32]. Therefore, there have been extensive anal-
ysis of the role of Gaussianity in operational tasks in the
contexts of quantum communication [33-36], quantum
thermodynamics [37-42], quantum simulation [43-45],
quantum coherence [21, 46-48], quantum sensing [49-53],
quantum learning theory [54-57] and quantum comput-
ing [58-63]. Gaussian operations are sufficient for quan-
tum advantage in several of these scenarios, but other
times they prove too limited compared to the much larger
class of non-Gaussian operations [64]. Viewing Gaus-
sianity as an operational constraint within the set of all
possible operations on CV systems has motivated the de-
velopment of Gaussian resource theories [65, 66] that at-
tempt to characterize and quantify the degree of non-
Gaussianity present in a CV system.
In this work, we bridge the notions of symmetry and
Gaussianity in the context of bosonic CV systems, and
study the effect of Gaussian constraints on symmetry-
respecting (covariant) operations, and vice versa. Specif-
ically, we study the consequences of symmetry in both
closed and open Gaussian time dynamics. For closed
systems, we identify quantities that remain conserved
if the dynamics is governed by Gaussian Hamiltonians
that respect a symmetry, but that are not conserved if
the Hamiltonian is not Gaussian or does not respect the
symmetry. Similarly, for open systems, we find functions
of quantum states that remain monotone under Gaussian
covariant operations.

‘We take an approach which is akin to quantum re-
source theories, and in particular to the resource theory
of asymmetry. In this context, the motivation and scope
of our results are twofold. Firstly, we investigate the
standard resource theory of asymmetry in the setting of
bosonic systems, where the set of free operations is de-
fined as all transformations that respect the underlying

symmetry. This establishes a systematic characteriza-
tion of asymmetry within a well-established theoretical
framework with broad applications. Secondly, we de-
velop and analyze a new resource-theoretic framework
in which the free operations are restricted to Gaussian
covariant operations. This refinement provides a frame-
work that is both physically motivated and experimen-
tally relevant, as it naturally incorporates the structural
features of Gaussian processes while respecting the im-
posed symmetry constraints. In analogy with the well-
studied notion of Gaussian entanglement, we refer to this
new framework as Gaussian asymmetry.

An immediate application of our framework lies in the
context of quantum thermodynamics, where the free op-
erations are those realizable by energy-conserving unitary
transformations together with ancillas in the thermal
state of the system’s intrinsic Hamiltonians. Recently,
Gaussian thermal operations have been studied [39] as
a restriction of the free operations that is desirable in
certain practical settings. To understand the connection
with our framework, we note that energy-conserving uni-
taries can equivalently be defined as unitaries that re-
spect a certain symmetry, namely, as unitaries that com-
mute with the time-translation symmetry generated by

the intrinsic Hamiltonian, i.e. exp(-ifft) for allt ER.
If the time evolution of the system is periodic, then the
corresponding family of unitary transformations forms a
Gaussian unitary representation of the group U(1), which
we study extensively in this work.

After a brief look at preliminary notation in Section II,
we introduce and characterize the representations of in-
terest in Section III. We then establish the core ingredi-
ents of the resource theory of Gaussian asymmetry in Sec-
tion IV, discussing monotones in Section V, and conser-
vation laws for closed systems in Section VI. We provide
a dilation theorem for our free operations in Section VII,
and we conclude in Section VIII.

Summary of main results

Covariant Gaussian dilation. We show that any
symmetry-respecting (ie. covariant) Gaussian channe
can be realized using Gaussian Hamiltonians that respec
the symmetry and couple the system to an environ-
ment initially prepared in a pure, symmetry-respecting
Gaussian state (Theorem 15). This result generalizes
he well-known Gaussian dilation of Gaussian channels
[32, 67]. Remarkably, our argument relies on a different
approach based on the ideas of Gaussian purification
and decoupling (see Fig. 6). This result strengthens
the operational significance of the resource theory o
Gaussian asymmetry, by providing an implementation
of free operations via symmetry-respecting Gaussian
unitaries and ancillary states.

Monotones for Gaussian asymmetry. In order

© quantify asymmetry in open covariant dynamics, in
Section V, we define and calculate quantities that are
monotone under the action of Gaussian covariant chan-
nels. Given a representation of interest S(g) : g € G
for a symmetry group G, we derive families of tractable
monotones of Gaussian asymmetry as well as of asymme-
ry in the displacement vector only (type-1 asymmetry)
and in the covariance matrix only (type-2 asymmetry)
of a quantum state p.

We introduce a family of type-l asymmetry mono-
‘ones that take the form

f(A) := rank (qi! (aa')) ,

where d is the displacement vector of any, possibly non-
Gaussian, state and T is a completely positive map
defined in Eq.(47) that projects dd‘ to an irreducible
representation ps of the symmetry.

We then give a recipe for constructing type-2 asym-
metry monotones. In the case of a Gaussian state
p = e- 9" /tr[e-8"] with covariance matrix o, we find
he following closed form for a family of such monotones,

det [(oa + 71-2) /2]
det[(o + $(g)o1-aS(g)*) /2]’

or any a € (0,1), g © G. Here, S$(g) is the matrix rep-

. 1
FL)(6) = —5 log

resentation 0: S(g) in terms of position and momentum
operators, and the quantity oq is the covariance matrix
of p*/tr[p%], ie. the thermal state of Hamiltonian H at
emperature (a3)~t. Monotones 2) are essentially ra-
ios of overlaps between Gaussian states obtained from /.
Specifically, the numerator corresponds to the overlap of
wo thermal states of Hamiltonian H with linear terms
removed, but at temperatures higher than the tempera-
ure of #, while the denominator corresponds to the same
overlap with one of the states rotated according to g € G.

In the important case of a continuous 1-parameter
HQ >t ER,
where Q is a Gaussian observable representing a con-
served charge, we obtain additional monotones,

family of unitary transformations S(t) =

1 _
Fo(6) = tt [2Q0; INQ, 01 p29] ,

where (2 is the symplectic form, and Q is the matrix
representation of Q in terms of position and momentum
operators.

Conservation laws for closed Gaussian systems.
All the above monotones remain conserved under closed
Gaussian dynamics that respect the symmetry. In Sec-
tion VI, we further introduce new conservation laws that
hold under closed Gaussian dynamics, but do not hold
under non-Gaussian dynamics.

Remarkably, we find that for Gaussian states lack-
ing coherence with respect to the eigenspaces of the
conserved charge, a simple finite set of conservation
laws captures all the consequences of symmetry and
Gaussianity (Theorem 11): if these laws are satisfied,
hen there exists a Gaussian charge-conserving unitary
hat transforms one, possibly mixed, state into the other.

Diagonalization with symplectic transforma-
tions (extension of Williamson’s theorem). As
a key technical ingredient to derive the conservation
aws, we introduce an extension of Williamson’s theo-
rem [68] (Theorem 12) that, under certain conditions, al-
lows for the simultaneous normal mode decomposition of
a positive-definite matrix and a symmetric matrix rep-
resenting the conserved charge. That is, we show that
hese two matrices can be simultaneously diagonalized
yy congruence via a symplectic transformation.

II. PRELIMINARIES

We first provide preliminary definitions on symmetry
representations and Gaussian systems.

A. Symmetry representations in the Hilbert space

We assume any system under consideration is
equipped with a unitary representation S(g):g € G ofa
symmetry group G, which, in general, can be a projective
representation, such that

5(92)5(g1) = w(g1, 92)5 (gear) 5 (1)

for all gi,g2 € G and S(g~!) = S(g)t, where w(gi, g2)
is a phase. Then, under symmetry transformation g €
G, the state |i) € H of the system is transformed as
|b) + S(g) |). This, in turn, implies that a density
operator 6 € B(H) transforms as p+ $(g)AS(g)t, and a
channel, i.e. a completely positive trace-preserving linear
map € : B(Ha) > B(H~) transforms as

£() + Sp(g)E(S4(g)()Sa(g)") Sala)"

where subscripts A and B label the input and output sys-
tems, respectively, which in general can be different. As
usual, rather than applying the transformation on states,
we can apply the dual transformation on observables, i.e.
an observable K transforms as K +> S(g)'KS(g).

B. Gaussian systems

Any system under consideration is a collection of a
finite number n of bosonic modes with position and
momentum operators # := (%1,P1,---;2n,Pn)? which
satisfy the canonical commutation relations a) =
(Pj, Pr] = 0, and (45, p.] = 10;,4, written compactly as

[*#7] =i, = iD e a) ; (2)

j=l

where 2 = Q, is the symplectic form on n modes!.
The annihilation and creation operators are @; = (@; +
ip;)/ V2, and al, respectively, and the n-mode vacuum
state joy?” is the unique state annihilated by all n anni-
hilation operators.

The Gaussian formalism can be defined based on the
notion of the second-order Hamiltonian

H= <=" HP+PE, (3)

where H is areal symmetric (2n x 2n) matrix and € € R?”
is a displacement vector. We refer to such Hamiltonians
as Gaussian Hamiltonians, and the group of unitaries
that can be realized by them, i.e. the group generated
by unitaries of the form e’”, as Gaussian unitaries.

Any Gaussian unitary can be brought to the standard
form U = DeV, where

De =e , (4)

for some € € R?”, is a Weyl displacement operator, and
V is a symplectic Gaussian unitary that can be realized
with purely quadratic Hamiltonians. Gaussian unitary
U transforms the position and momentum operators as

He = Vi (DiPDe)V = VEE, (5)

where V = e~°! is a (2n x 2n) real matrix? satisfying
VOQVT = Q. The set of (2n x 2n) real matrices satis-
fying this condition forms the symplectic group denoted
Sp(2n,R). In particular, symplectic Gaussian unitaries
form a subgroup of the full Gaussian unitary group?.

A Gaussian quantum density matrix f is a thermal

state e~°” /tr[e—?"] of a positive second-order Hamilto-
nian AH with 8 > 0 and it is fully specified by its dis-
placement vector d and covariance matrix ¢,

d:=tr[pr], o=tr[p{(#-d),(#-d)"}]. (6)
Here, o satisfies ¢ = oT and the uncertainty relation
ao +iQ2 > 0. The limit of zero temperature, i.e. 3 — 00,
corresponds to pure Gaussian states.

A bosonic quantum channel is a completely-positive
trace-preserving (CPTP) map € : B(H4) > B(Hg,) from
input bosonic system A to output bosonic system B.

1 If the number of modes of system A is unclear, we write 04
instead. Notation is further explained in Appendix A 1.

2 We denote the phase space matrix associated with a Hilbert space
operator by simply dropping the hat, unless otherwise stated.

3 Indeed, the correspondence —QH 1+ if for purely quadratic raf
yields a faithful representation of the Lie algebra. Specifically,

iA, =([ifp,ifco]) — = -OH, =[-QHg,-OQHc}.
A Gaussian channel € is a subclass of bosonic chan-
nels [67, 69] that transform the displacement vector d
and covariance matrix o of the input as

di+Xd+€, ot XoX"+Y, (7)
for an arbitrary real vector € and two arbitrary real ma-
trices X and Y satisfying

Y +i(Qp —XQ4X")>0, (8)

where 24 and Qg are the input and output symplec
tic forms, respectively. Gaussian channels map Gaussian
states to Gaussian states, even when they act on a sub-
system of a composite system, i.e. (E@Zz)(faz) is Gaus-
sian whenever fag is Gaussian, for any environment E
with arbitrary number of modes. We provide a formal
definition in Appendix F 1.

Appendix A2 overviews additional details on Gaus-
sian formalism that are relevant to our proofs.

Ill. INVARIANCE UNDER SYMPLECTIC
REPRESENTATIONS OF SYMMETRY

In our framework, all systems under consideration are
equipped with a (possibly projective) Gaussian unitary
representation of a group G, denoted as g + U(g), for
all group elements g € G. This means that the symme-
try transformation acts linearly on position and momen-
tum operators as described by Eq.(5). In particular, we
are often interested in representations which do not con-
tain displacements, which correspond to the case € = 0
in Eq.(5). That is U(g) = S(g), where S(g) is in the
symplectic subgroup of Gaussian unitaries. Let S(g) be

the symplectic matrix associated with $(g) via Eq.(5).
Then, for any (possibly projective) symplectic Gaussian
representation g +> S(g) in the Hilbert space, the map
g++ S(g) defines its associated symplectic representation
of symmetry in the phase space, namely it satisfies

S(g2g1) = S(g2)S(g1), and

so") = Sia)", ”

for all g1, 92,9 €G.

Consider systems A and B with na and ng modes,
and position and momentum operators 74 and fp, re-
spectively. Then, the composite system AB has n4 +ng
modes and we write the position and momentum oper-
ators as 74 ®fg. The symmetry representation on the
composite system is the tensor product of representa-
tions, g + Sap(g) = Sa(g) ® Sp(g), in the Hilbert
space, with associated phase space representation g >
Sab(g) = Sa(g) ® SB(g). Note that each of the subsys-
tem representations $4, Sp can generally entangle modes
within the subsystem.

A. Symmetry-respecting Gaussian operators and
channels in phase space

Operators and channels that remain unchanged under
the action of a symmetry group G take a central role
in the study of asymmetry. Table I shows how different
object of interest in phase space transform under symme-
try transformations, allowing us to characterize invariant
Gaussian operators and covariant Gaussian channels in
the phase space.

TABLE I. The action of symmetry transformations in
phase space. This table summarizes how different objects
of interest transform under a symmetry transformation de-
scribed by a symplectic matrix S, namely, displacement vec-
tors d and covariance matrices o associated with a quantum
state via Eq.(6), displacement vectors € and symplectic ma-
trices V associated with a Gaussian unitary U via Eq.(5),
the X,Y matrices associated with a Gaussian channel via
Eq.(7), and symmetric matrix H associated with a second-
order Hamiltonian A via Eq.(3). The type of tensor associ-
ated to each object is determined by the number of matrices
S or S* and their inverses that appear in the transformation.

Given a symplectic Gaussian representation g +> s (g)
of group G, state f is called G-invariant if [A, 5(g)] = 0
for all g € G. This implies invariance of its displacement
vector d and covariance matrix o under the associated
phase space representation g +> S(q),

S(g)d=d, and

S(g)oS(g)? =o, forallg eG. G0)
The above constraints are satisfied by all invariant states,
whether Gaussian or not. However, for Gaussian states,
they guarantee that the state is G-invariant.
A Gaussian unitary U = DeV is called G-invariant
when [U, $(g)] = 0 for all g € G. This is equivalent to
invariance of vector € and symplectic matrix V,

S(g)§ =€, and (11)

S(g)VS(g)1 =V, forallgeG.
In particular, the displacement vector € is invariant if and
only if it is restricted to modes where the symmetry rep-
resentation acts trivially. In Appendix B 2, we show that
any G-invariant symplectic Gaussian unitary can be de-
composed as V = ele! for G-invariant Hamiltonians
Hi, and Ay. It follows that the subgroup of symplectic
Gaussian unitaries respecting the symmetry is connected.

Finally, consider a Gaussian channel € : B(H4) >
B(Hg) with input and output symplectic Gaussian rep-
resentations g +> Sa(g) and g + Sa(Q) of group G.
Channel € is called G-covariant when

E(Sa(9)()S4(9)) = Sa()E()Sa(9)" . for all g EG,

(12)
which is equivalent to the G-invariance of ,X and Y,
Sa(gg =€,
XSa(g) = Sp(g)X, and (13)
Sp(g)¥Sa(g)' =Y, forallgeG.

Appendix B2 offers a proof of the equivalence be-
tween Hilbert space and phase space invariance condi-
tions based on the transformation rules in Table I.

B. Orthogonal symplectic (passive) representations

A particularly physically relevant family of Gaussian
representations is defined by the so-called passive uni-
taries, a terminology borrowed from the quantum optics
literature [32, 70]. We call an operator passive if it com-
mutes with the free Hamiltonian of harmonic oscillators
with identical frequencies,

1 n 1
Fetes > 5 +p) =>- (aa 5) . (14)

j=l j=l

Specifically, a symplectic Gaussian unitary $ and its as-
sociated symplectic matrix S are passive if S is also or-
thogonal, i.e. SQ.ST = and SST = J, that is,

S € Sp(2n,R) NO(2n,R) & Ulm). (15)

The isomorphism with U(n) can be explained as a con-
sequence of the fact that passive transformations do not
mix annihilation operators with creation operators, and
act unitarily within each set. That is, under any passive
representation of group G,

+ S(g)t = LUin(a) Gg (16)

where g++ U(g) defines an n-dimensional unitary repre-
sentation of group G' (see Appendix B 1 for details).

In the case of passive representations, since S(g)? =
S(g)~!, invariance by congruence is equivalent to invari-
ance by similarity. Hence, the invariance conditions on
all matrices 0, V, X, Y, and H, are equivalent to com-
mutation with S(g) for all g € G. The following propo-
sition, proved in Appendix A 2, gathers frequently used
properties of passive unitaries and quadratic observables.

Proposition 1. For any purely quadratic observable
= pe Qjxh jfk, where Q = Q™ is symmetric, the
following statements are equivalent:

on

(1) eis is a passive symplectic Gaussian unitary for
alls € R;

(2) e~22° is orthogonal symplectic for all s € R;
(3) Q commutes with the free Hamiltonian;

(4) Q commutes with 0;
5) the vacuum state is an eigenvector of Q.

Apart from the pure vacuum state \0)°", passive op-
erators also leave invariant any free thermal state
e PHtree /ty[e—P Hire] with pol & 0),

C. Invariant Hamiltonians

In terms of creation and annihilation operators, a
Gaussian Hamiltonian can be written as H = H? + H™?,
where

AP = AK ala,, HP = Lit aja, +H.c., (17)

denote the passive and non-passive terms, respectively.
If HP A 0, then under the Hamiltonian H the vac-
uum evolves into a pure Gaussian state exhibiting squeez-
ing. Equivalently, its density operator does not commute
with Hee. While there always exists a passive Gaussian
Hamiltonian that respects any symmetry, namely Hfree, a
representation may not allow the existence of G-invariant
non-passive Gaussian Hamiltonians.

A passive representation transforms a greta n-mode
second-order Hamiltonian H ++ $(g)HS(g)' as HP 4
U(g)H?U(g)t and H®? ++ U(g)H®PU(g)?. We thus
identify necessary and sufficient conditions for H to be
invariant under the given representation,

U(g)H?U(g)' = HP,

(18)
U(g) HU)" =,

for all g € G. The matrices HP and H®? satisfy-
ing the conditions in Eq.(18) are characterized in Ap-
pendix B 3. In particular, using the vectorization of these
equations, one finds that invariant Hamiltonians corre-
spond to subspaces that are invariant under the repre-
sentations U(g) ® U(g)* and U(g) ® U(g) for g € G,
respectively. In general, the form of invariant states and
operations depends on the choice of representation, as we
illustrate in Fig. 1 by considering composite systems with
different numbers of modes on each subsystem, necessi-
tating subsystem representations of different dimensions.
By decomposing the representation g ++ U(g) to irreps
and applying Schur’s lemma, one can fully characterize
the matrices that satisfy these conditions, as we further
explain in Section IITE.

FIG. 1. Gaussian systems and symmetry represen-
tations. Each system under consideration is a collection of
bosonic modes carrying a representation of a symmetry group
G, which, in general, can differ between subsystems. In this
example, systems A, B, and C have 3, 3, and 2 bosonic modes,
respectively, and carry an arbitrary representation of group G
with dimension equal to the number of modes of the system.
Since all Gaussian Hamiltonians are quadratic, interactions in
this framework can only couple pairs of systems, i.e. they are
2-local. The symmetry further restricts these 2—local interac-
tions (see Appendix B5 for further discussion and examples
including the group SU(2) and the permutation group S3).

Example: U(1) symmetry

We start with the important case of U(1) symmetry,
which can have different physical interpretations. These
include invariance under rotations around a fixed axis in
real space, time-translational invariance in periodic sys-
tems, or, equivalently, energy conservation, and insensi-
tivity under phase shifts.

For a system with n modes, consider the U(1) symme-
try associated with the observable

a ii
2 gala; => (a + py — 5) : (19)
j=l j=l

where integer q; determines the charge associated with
mode j, and constant 4 5 can be ignored as it corresponds
to a global phase. If ir. = wQ i is the intrinsic Hamiltonian
of a system of n modes, then q;w is the energy of an
excitation in mode j, e.g. a photon or a phonon, or,
equivalently, the frequency associated with that mode.
More precisely, assume the action of the U(1) symme-
try for any phase @ € [0, 27) is represented by operator

O(6) = exp(i6Q) = exp (idgala,) , (20)

cos(q;9)

(21)
where Q = Bj qj is the total conserved charge, and
each mode is treated as its own subsystem with repre-
sentation 6 ++ O;(0) := exp(—0q;). In general, charges
qj can be arbitrary integers. In the context of quantum
thermodynamics, when Q is interpreted as the intrinsic
Hamiltonian of a system, the charges q; are all positive,
otherwise, if q; < 0, for some j, the Hamiltonian of mode
j will be unbounded and so will not admit a proper ther-
mal state. However, as we describe in Appendix A 3,
engineering Hamiltonians with negative frequencies is a
common technique in quantum optics, used, for example,
to implement 2—mode squeezing [71, 72].

Modes with charge q; = 0 are not restricted by the
U(1) symmetry and may have arbitrary Gaussian Hamil-
tonians. However, they cannot be coupled to modes with
non-zero charge. For any mode with charge q; # 0, the
only 1-mode Hamiltonian that respects the symmetry is
ala,, up to normalization. This Hamiltonian generates a
phase-shifter, with associated symplectic matrix

Vps(d) = e7 9? = (3 ne) . 6 € (0,2). (22)

Two modes j and k with non-zero charges qj, qx are cou-
pled by a U(1)-invariant Hamiltonian FH if and only if
[H, QQ] = 0, ie. all (2 x 2) blocks H;), that couple mode
j and mode k satisfy

Ay, = — (Gq!) QA Q. (23)
In particular, modes with charges of unequal magnitude
are uncoupled, ie. Hj, = 0 unless qj = tqz. This

can be seen by considering any unitary-invariant norm of
both sides of Eq.(23), e.g. the operator norm. Hence, up
to normalization and a phase shift, the U(1)—invariant
Gaussian Hamiltonians are

Biss = (aja - Hc.) , Hog =i (Gjan —Hc.) , (24)

for qj = qx # 0 and for q; = —qx # 0, respectively,
which generate the beam-splitter and 2—mode squeezing
operators, with associated symplectic matrices

Unless ¢ € {0,7} and r = 0, these operators do not
t

commute with the free Hamiltonians aja; and alan,
which means they exchange the conserved charge be-
tween modes j and k. Together with phase-shifters,
they generate all U(1)-invariant Gaussian unitaries, as
we prove in Appendix B6.

Proposition 2. All U(1)-invariant Gaussian unitaries
are generated by displacement operators on zero-charge
sectors, phase-shifters, beam-splitters between sectors of
equal charge and 2—-mode squeezers between sectors of op-
posite charge.

When all charges q; are equal, then invariant symplec-
tic matrices coincide with passive symplectic matrices,
and there exists a known algorithm [73] that decomposes
them into phase-shifters and beam-splitters.

SU(2): Schwinger model of angular momentum

Suppose that a 2—-mode system is equipped with the
defining representation of the SU(2) symmetry, generated
by angular momentum operators

i : (atb+ai'). (27)

This construction is known as the Schwinger boson rep-
resentation of angular momentum [74]. Using the Euler
decomposition of SU(2) elements, this immediately de-
fines a representation of SU(2) as

§(U) = ev iad: piaade pias J. , (28)

where a1,@2,a@3 are the Euler angles associated to uni-
ary U € SU(2).

This system does not admit any single-body non-
assive SU(2)-invariant operator, which follows from the
fact that the defining irreducible representation of SU(2)
is pseudo-real (see discussion in Section IIE). Never-
heless, it does allow for two-body non-passive SU(2)—
invariant operators. In particular, the quadratic SU(2)—
invariant Hamiltonians

AP =ata+ bt, (29)
AP = Glan + Oth , (30)
AY? = e'® (Gib — byan) + H.c., (31)

are, respectively, single-body passive, two-body passive,
and two-body non-passive, for arbitrary ¢ € [0,27). Note
that, unlike the passive Hamiltonians, H™? allows inter-
actions between the modes associated with @ and 6.

D. Symplectic representations with invariant
states: Squeezed passive representations

An important feature of orthogonal symplectic repre-
sentations, which is crucial in our work, is the existence
of invariant states: the vacuum and, more generally, all

7

thermal states of the free Hamiltonian Hire. In contrast,
a general symplectic representation S : G — Sp(2n,R)
of a symmetry group G does not necessarily admit an
invariant state. A prominent example is given by the full
symplectic group itself. In particular, there is no state
that remains invariant under the 1-mode squeezing op-
erator exp(r(at? - a*)), when r # 0, described by its
associated symplectic matrix

To see this note that, according to Eq.(10), if a state with
covariance matrix ¢ is invariant, then o~'/?$(g)o!/? is
orthogonal. In other words, the representation g +> S(q)
is similar to an orthogonal representation. The eigenval-
ues of Visq(r) are e” and e~", so the 1-mode squeezing
operator cannot be similar to an orthogonal transforma-
tion when r 4 0.

However, this phenomenon cannot occur in the impor-
tant case of finite groups, and more generally of compact
groups such as U(1) and SU(d). Moreover, all representa-
tions that admit a physical invariant state are equivalent
to a passive representation.

Proposition 3. Let G be a group with a symplectic rep-
resentation S : G — Sp(2n,R) that admits a G-invariant
quantum state with finite covariance matrix a, i.e. such
that S(g)oS(g)? =o for all g € G (this condition is au-
tomatically satisfied if G is compact). Then, the following
statements are true.

(i) Representation S is symplectically equivalent to a
passive (orthogonal symplectic) one; that is, there
exists a symplectic matriz R € Sp(2n,R) such that,
for allg €G,

O(g) = R-S(g)R €Sp2n,R)NO2n). (33)

(ii) The passive representation O is unique up to conju-
gation by an orthogonal symplectic transformation;
that is, if O(g) = R-15(g)R is passive for some g €

G and symplectic matriz R, then O(g) = TO(g)T™
for some orthogonal symplectic matriz T.

(iii) Representation S admits a pure Gaussian G-
invariant state, which is characterized by zero dis-
placement and covariance matriz RR*.

In Appendix B7, we present a self-contained proof. For
any symplectic matrix R, and orthogonal symplectic rep-
resentation G — Sp(2n,R)M O(2n), we shall refer to the
family of representations defined by

S(g) = RO(g)R*: 9 €G, (34)

as squeezed passive representations.

A few remarks on this important proposition are in
order. First, statement (i) for compact groups is an im-
mediate consequence of the Cartan-Iwasawa-Malcev the-
orem, which states that any compact subgroup of a con-
nected Lie group is contained in a maximal compact sub-
group, and all maximal compact subgroups are conjugate
to each other [75-77].
Second, the uniqueness of the associated passive repre-
sentation O(g) up to a passive symplectic transformation
follows from the symplectic singular value decomposition,
also known as the Bloch-Messiah decomposition [78, 79].
As a simple example, consider two different representa-
ions of U(1) symmetry on a single mode, as

O1(0) = e®® or O2(0) =e, (35)

or @ € [0, 27). While these representations are equivalent.
as real representations, i.e. they are related as

02(8) = VOx(0)V~", (36)

for all 6 € [0,27) with e.g. V = Z, they are not sym-
lectically equivalent; that is, there exists no symplectic
ransformation V satisfying the above equation. Accord-
ing to statement (ii) of Proposition 3, this can be seen
y simply noting that no passive symplectic transforma-
ion V can convert one representation into the other. In
his example, all such passive transformations are of the
form e%® for some ¢ € [0, 27), which commutes with the
representation, and therefore cannot change it.

Third, statement (iii) of Proposition 3 implies that the
existence of a G-invariant state under a symplectic Gaus-
sian representation S(g) : g € G guarantees the existence
of a pure G-invariant Gaussian state |7), satisfying

5(g) In) = |n) « (37)

for all g € G. This statement is not generally true for
non-Gaussian representations. For example, although
he maximally mixed qubit state is invariant under SU(2)
rotations, no pure qubit state is SU(2)—invariant.

Analysis of passive representations is directly appli-
cable to squeezed passive representations via the basis
change induced by R. In the Hilbert space, this means
hat any symplectic Gaussian representation with invari-
ant states is equivalent to S(g) = RO(g)R' : g € G,
where R is a symplectic Gaussian unitary. Equivalently,
here exist annihilation operators b, = Ra, Ri, that can

e written as a linear combination of operators {4,, aly,
via what is known as a Bogoliubov transformation, and,
relative to this new basis, $(g) does not mix creation and
annihilation operators,

$(g)'bj$(g) = $0 Ujx(9)be , (38)
k

where g++ U(g) represents group G unitarily, generaliz-
ing Eq.(16) to all squeezed passive representations. We
note that the above decomposition is not unique and de-
pends on the choice of the annihilation operators {b;}-
However, according to statement (ii) in Proposition 3,
different choices of these operators result in the same
unitary U(g) on annihilation operators, up to a unitary
change of basis.

For example, for the single-mode U(1) representations
given in Eq.(35), the corresponding unitaries are simple

FIG. 2. Squeezed passive representations. We sketch
the action of squeezed passive representations of U(1), 6
S1-(@) := Visa(r) exp(—9Q) Visa(—r) for different squeezing pa-
rameters r, on the displaced vacuum state Deoyt |0). These
transformations move phase space points anti-clockwise on
an ellipsoid, with the passive representation (r = 0), corre-
sponding to a circle. Each element S$,(9) for fixed 0) com-
mutes with representation S,, if and only if r’ = r, whereas
its transpose S;-(00)" = S—,(—00) commutes with S,, if and
only if r’ = —r. We discuss when a (1,1)-tensor and its
transpose simultaneously commute with the same representa-
tion in Appendix B 1. The complex conjugate representations
@ + S;(—@) move points clockwise instead. We also depict
the state’s covariance matrix under the action of the represen-
tation with r = 0.1. The covariance matrix picks up squeezing
along its orbit, but returns to the same state after a 7 rotation,
ie. it respects the Zz symmetry. We generalize this observa-
tion for any representation of U(1) in Appendix B 8, where we
show that a Gaussian operator which breaks the U(1) sym-
metry always breaks the symmetry of a finite U(1) subgroup
of sufficiently high order. Instead, the state Visq(r) |0) is an
invariant state of representation Sj, for all r.

phase factors, i.e. (1 x 1) unitaries, equal to e~® and e,
respectively.

As a consequence, squeezed passive representations
can, up to conjugation by a symplectic transformation,
be decomposed into unitary irreducible representations
of the group. These can then be used to fully charac-
terize invariant Hamiltonians, invariant quantum states,
and covariant channels as we discuss in Section HIE. An-
other desirable property of squeezed passive representa-
tions is that invariant Gaussian unitaries act transitively
on invariant pure Gaussian states, which we prove in Ap-
pendix C1 by constructing the unitary in terms of the

states’ displacement vectors and covariance matrices.

As an example, Fig. 2 illustrates the squeezed passive
representation 0 > exp(i0(e~?" 4? + e"p")), obtained by
conjugating a 1-mode U(1) representation with charge
q=1 by a 1-mode squeezing operator.

Complex Conjugate Representation

Given any unitary representation U(g) :g €G in the
Hilbert space, one can consider the complex conjugate
representation U(g)* : g € G, where complex conjuga-
tion (*) is defined with respect to a fixed arbitrary basis,
and corresponds to an anti-unitary transformation in the
Hilbert space. We use the convention that this fixed basis
is the common eigenbasis of the position operators {#,},
which means under complex conjugation the momentum
operators transform as pj ++ —pj, ie. FH (I @ Z)P.
With this convention, the complex conjugation can be
interpreted as time reversal.

Suppose S(g) :g € G is a symplectic Gaussian rep-
resentation with associated phase space representation
g +> S(g). Then, S(g)* : g € G is also a symplectic
Gaussian representation with associated representation

gH (L@Z)S(g)\(1@Z). (39)

E. Irrep decomposition & the trichotomy of irreps

A standard method for characterizing the set of invari-
ant states and Hamiltonians is via decomposition into
irreducible representations. Consider a group G with
squeezed passive representation g ++ S(g) = RO(g)R-+
for symplectic R and orthogonal symplectic representa-
tion g ++ O(g). Then, according to Eq.(38), we can
choose a proper basis for the annihilation, such that they
transform unitarily under the action of symmetry, with-
out mixing with creation operators. By decomposing this
unitary representation into irreducible representations,
we find a basis {by,n,a} such that

dy

S(9)! baja $(9) = SOWACM ie Breas — (40)
k=1

or all g € G. Here, \ labels the inequivalent irreps of
G, each with dimension dy, [U,(g)];x ave the matrix ele-
ments of irrep A with indices j,k =1,...,d,, andaisa
multiplicity index. The overall transformation mapping
he set {4,;, al} of the original annihilation and creation
operators to the set {Oy j,01 bh at is a Bogoliubov trans-
formation, which is described by a symplectic matrix.

For a given squeezed passive representation g ++ S(g),
he multiplicity m(A) of an irrep appearing in the de-
composition in Eq.(40) remains invariant under any sym-
lectic change of basis, i.e. under a similarity transfor-
mation RS(g)R~! by a symplectic matrix R.

Proposition 4. Any symplectic representation S :G—
Sp(2n,R) of a group G that admits an invariant state,
is uniquely specified, up to a similarity transformation
S(g) > RS(g)R-+ : g € G by a@ symplectic matrix
R € Sp(2n,R), in terms of the integer multiplicities m(\)
defined above, for all unitary irreps X of group G.

The proof is presented in Appendix B7. It is worth no’
ing that similarity transformations by general, possibly
non-symplectic, real matrices, such as the time-reversal
I ® Z in Eq.(39), can change m(A). However, it is still
guaranteed that the sum m(A) + m(A*) remains con-
served, where \* denotes the dual irrep of  [80, 81],
ie. the irrep equivalent tot U¥ (see Appendix B 3).
In general, symmetry forbids correlations between
modes transforming under inequivalent irreps, except
when the irreps are related by complex conjugation. In
particular, based on the decomposition in Eq.(40), we
present a full characterization of symmetry-respecting
Gaussian Hamiltonians, unitaries, and channels (see
Proposition 19 in Appendix B 3). Here, we highlight an
important implication of this characterization.

Proposition 5. Let p be a, possibly non-Gaussian, G—
invariant state. Modes transforming under irreps X and
N, i.e. modes associated with annihilation operators
by jae and By grees can be correlated only if = X or
N = \*. Likewise, G-invariant Hamiltonians and uni-
taries couple modes associated with by je and by ja!
only if X =X or NX = X*.

Finally, for any Gaussian G-covariant channel, the
output modes with annihilation operator transforming
under an irrep X can depend non-trivially only on in-
put modes with annihilation operator transforming under
irreps X or X*.

This proposition, for instance, implies that a non-
passive quadratic Hamiltonian can be G-invariant only if
there exist two distinct sets of modes carrying dual irreps,
or if there is a set of modes carrying an irrep that is self-
dual (i.e. equivalent to its own dual). As another con-
sequence, the only U(1)-covariant channels on 1—mode
systems, for which the output depends non-trivially on

the input, correspond to frequencies gout = +4in. These
channels are called phase-covariant when qout = din, and
phase-contravariant when gout = —4in-

An important special case arises when n subsystems
carry the same representation, and this representation is
irreducible, that is, only a single \ appears in Eq.(40),
occurring with multiplicity n, ie. U(g) = Uy(g) ® In.
In this case, the corresponding real symplectic represen-
tation g ++ S(q) is irreducible over R but reducible over
C. This reducibility can be seen from the fact that, for
all g € G, S(g) does not mix annihilation and creation

4 Since the representations are unitary, the notions of complex
conjugate and dual irreps coincide.
operators by ja and Bia When U) is irreducible, i
dual representation UX is also irreducible. In general, VU;
may or may not be equivalent to U). That is, there may
or may not exist an invertible matrix B such that

i B

Uy(g)* = BU (9) B, (41)

for all g € G. It turns out that if such a matrix B ex-
ists, it is either symmetric or anti-symmetric (see Ap-
pendix B 3), so the relationship between these two irreps
falls into three cases, each with important consequences
for invariant Hamiltonians and states:

(i) Complex irreps. U, and UX are inequivalent; that
is, there exists no invertible matrix B satisfying
Eq.(41). This occurs, for example, for the U(1)
symmetry on a single mode. In this case, if all
subsystems carry the same irrep, then there is no
non-passive G-invariant Gaussian Hamiltonian.

(ii) Real irreps. U, and U¥ are equivalent via a sym-
metric matrix B. This occurs, for example, for the
ermutation group S,,, where all irreps are real, i.e.
B =I. Inthis case, if all subsystems carry the same
irrep, both single-body and two-body G-invariant
non-passive Hamiltonians exist. In particular, the
Hamiltonian

8
EH? — e¢ Ss Bjpajay, + H.c., (42)
jk=1

is G-invariant for any ¢ € [0,27), where Bj, are
he matrix elements of B.

(iii) Pseudo-real irreps. U, and UX are equivalent via
an anti-symmetric matrix B. This occurs, for ex-
ample, for SU(2), where B = Q). In this case,
if all systems carry the same irrep, there are two-
ody G-invariant non-passive Hamiltonians, such
as the one in Eq.(31), but no single-body non-
assive Hamiltonians. In particular, the Hamilto-
nian in Eq.(42) vanishes.

A more detailed discussion of this irrep classification is
provided in Appendix B3.

Entangled G—invariant Gaussian states

As another example of important consequences of the
above trichotomy of irreps, consider a system composed
of n subsystems, each containing d modes that transform
under the same d—dimensional irrep of a symmetry group
G. Consider the set of pure G-invariant Gaussian density
operators. In the case of a passive representation, this set
contains the state in which all modes are in the vacuum.
In the case of n = 1, i.e. when there is only one sub-
system, then the vacuum is the only invariant pure state
if the irrep U is complex or pseudo-real. On the other

10

hand, for n > 1 subsystems, the vacuum is the only in-
variant state if the irrep U is complex. In other words,
when the irrep is real or pseudo-real, G-invariant states
can contain entanglement, e.g. by evolving the vacuum
under the two-body non-passive Hamiltonians in Eq.(42),
such as the Hamiltonian in Eq.(31) for SU(2).

In Appendix B4, we characterize the covariance ma-
trix of certain invariant quantum states.

IV. RESOURCE THEORY OF
GAUSSIAN ASYMMETRY

A. Free states and free operations

All systems under consideration are equipped with a
squeezed passive representation of a symmetry group G,
as defined in Proposition 3. Then, we specify a resource
theory with the following ingredients:

Free states: Gaussian states that are invariant under
a representation of G, as characterized by Eq.(10) in
phase space.

Free operations: Gaussian channels that are covariant
under the input and output representations of G, as
characterized by Eq.(13) in phase space.

For brevity, we sometimes refer to this resource theory
as Gaussian asymmetry, in analogy to Gaussian entan-
glement. We emphasize, however, that this terminology
is imprecise, since in this framework both asymmetry and
non-Gaussianity can play the role of a resource.

Restricting to squeezed passive representations guar-
antees that the set of free states is not empty, and
contains both pure and mixed states. We can also define
free unitary operations as a subset of the free operations.

Free unitary operations: Gaussian unitaries that are
invariant under representations of G, as characterized
by Eq.(11) in phase space.

As discussed in Section I, restricting to such opera-
tions and states is motivated by physical and practical
considerations. In particular, it is less expensive to im-
plement such operations in various operational contexts
compared to other operations.

The resource theory of Gaussian asymmetry inherits
many desirable properties from the resource theories of
asymmetry and non-Gaussianity. These properties in-
clude that the theory is closed under partial trace and
tensoring a free state, while the tensor product of free
operations is a free operation. It is a non-convex the-
ory, as in the case of a trivial symmetry it reduces to the
non-convex resource theory of non-Gaussianity.

Free operations act transitively on free states. That
is, for any pair of G-invariant Gaussian states p; and
fz there exists a Gaussian channel that converts p; to
f2. Moreover, free unitaries act transitively on free pure
states as we show in Appendix C1.

Proposition 6. Let G be a symmetry group with
squeezed passive representation g ++ RO(g)R' in Hilbert
space H, where O is passive. Let ld1),;u2) € H be
any pair of pure invariant Gaussian states, and denote
the displacement vector and covariance matrix of |p) as
dy, 0%, respectively, for k = 1,2. .

Then, there exists an invariant Gaussian unitary U,
such that U |w1) = \W2). Furthermore, the unitary can be
realized as U = DeV with

€=d2.-—d,, and

(43
V =R(Ro1o.R-T)2(R-10,R-T)-? RI. )
Combined with Proposition 3, this implies that all G—
invariant pure Gaussian states of a composite system can
be obtained from a fixed G-invariant pure Gaussian state
that is unentangled across subsystems.

Example: U(1) asymmetry

Recall that a (2n x 2n) real matrix M commutes
with U(1) representation O(@) = exp(—@QQ), where
= Oya qjJ if and only if its (2 x 2) blocks Mj, satisfy
the condition of Eq.(23), leading to

if qj = +4.

. (44)
if qj = —4ak.

myr exp(OjKQ) ,
Myr =
minZ exp(Ojx.Q) ,

for real coefficients mx and 0; € [0,27). Then, we can
specify a resource theory of U(1) asymmetry with the
following ingredients:

Free states: Gaussian states with displacement vector
d that is supported on modes with zero charge, and
covariance matrix o of the form of Eq.(44). Note that in
order for o to be symmetric, we require that mj, = mp;
and 0j~r = ¥6x; for qj = +qx. In particular, the di-
agonal blocks are proportional to the identity, oj; = aj,I.

Free Channels: Gaussian channels characterized by
Eq.(13) in phase space, with € supported on modes with
zero charge, and X,Y of the form of Eq.(44). Again,
for Y to be symmetric, we require that mj, = mg; and
Ojn = FOx; for a7 = tax.

Free Unitaries: Gaussian unitaries DeV, with € sup-
ported on modes with zero charge, and symplectic matrix
V of the form of Eq.(44).

B. Two types of Gaussian asymmetry

Gaussian channels do not mix the displacement vector
and the covariance matrix of a quantum state /, as seen

11

in Eq.(7), which has implications in the manipulation of
Gaussian asymmetry.

Given a symplectic Gaussian representation g > Ss (9),
we say that a state p contains type-l asymmetry i
S(g)d # d for some g € G, i.e. its displacement vector
breaks the symmetry condition satisfied by G-invariant
states. Similarly, state p contains type-2 asymmetry i
S(g)oS(g)? # o for some g € G, ie. its covariance
matrix breaks the symmetry condition satisfied by G—
invariant states. Crucially, these two types of asymmetry
remain distinct under Gaussian covariant channels, tha
is, the output state contains each type, only if the inpu'
state contains it. Non-Gaussian covariant operations, on
the other hand, can convert type-1 to type-2 asymmetry,
but not the other way around. Specifically, we prove the
following statement in Appendix C 2.

Proposition 7. Covariant channels cannot transform
a Gaussian state p with no type-1 asymmetry to a state
which contains type-1 asymmetry, regardless of the type—
2 asymmetry of p.

On the contrary, for any pure Gaussian state which
contains type-1 asymmetry, there exists a, necessarily
non-Gaussian, covariant channel that maps it to a state
which contains type-2 asymmetry.

In Section V B, we present monotones that are defined
exclusively through either the displacement vector or the
covariance matrix, which will be called type-1 and type—
2 Gaussian asymmetry monotones, respectively.

While for Gaussian states, lack of asymmetry in
he displacement and covariance matrix implies that
state is invariant under the action of symmetry,
his is not the case for non-Gaussian states, for
which higher moments are not determined by the
first two. For instance, consider the non-Gaussiz
states p = } (|0) +[3) + [6)) ((0| + (3] + (6]) and fp =
3 ({0\0| + |3)(3] + |66|). They have indistinguishable
first two moments, with zero displacement and covari-
ance matrix 77, but, under phase shifts, 6, transforms
non-trivially, whereas f2 is incoherent and remains in-
variant. Therefore, the asymmetry content of fj; lies en-
irely in its higher-order central moments. Consequently,
o understand and characterize the asymmetry of non-
Gaussian states, one can extend the definitions of type-1
and type-2 asymmetry to higher central moments.

C. Complete characterization of first moments
under Gaussian covariant dynamics

Consider the set of reachable states by Gaussian co-
variant channels from a given initial state. Here, we char-
acterize the displacement vectors of the reachable states.
Recall that for any, possibly non-Gaussian, input state
with displacement vector d, the displacement vector of
the output state of a Gaussian channel is d’ = Xd+ €,
where, in general, € and X are unrestricted real vector
and matrix, respectively. For a covariant Gaussian chan-
nel, Eq.(13) implies that the displacement vector € van-
ishes on modes where the symmetry acts non-trivially,
ut remains fully unrestricted on modes carrying the
rivial representation of symmetry. Hence, in the follow-
ing discussion, we restrict attention to the modes where
he symmetry acts non-trivially. Moreover, for covariant
channels, the transformation matrix X must satisfy the
commutation relation [X,$(g)] = 0 for all g € G, where,
for simplicity, we assume that the input and output sys-
ems have the same number of modes and carry the same
representation of the symmetry.

Consider a group G with squeezed passive represen-
ation g ++ S(g). The set of displacement vectors of
reachable states is

S(d) := span{Xd: X € Mg(2n, 2n), ie
[X, S(g)| =0 for all g € G}, 2)

where Mg(2n,2n) denotes the set of all real (2n x 2n)
matrices. To characterize the subspace S(d), we consider
the irrep decomposition of the representation given by
Eq.(40) to irreps. In particular, we write

KS(g)K-t= a U, (9) ® In, (46)

HEM

where M := AU A* is the union of inequivalent irreps A
in the space of annihilation operators and their duals A*,
and N,, is the multiplicity space of irrep js. Note that, in
general, matrix K is neither unitary nor symplectic, but
is invertible.

Let T™ : Mc(2n x 2n) + Mc(d, x dy) be the com-
pletely positive map that projects (2n x 2n) complex ma-
trices to irrep jz. Formally, this map is given by

T)(-) = try, [W,.K()K'O,], (47)

where II, is the projector onto irrep . Roughly speak-
ing, for modes carrying irrep jz, the support of T) (dd')
determines” the subspace S(d) of displacement vectors
that can be reached from the initial state with displace-
ment vector d.

The above intuition is formulated in the following
proposition, which fully characterizes S(d), the set of
displacement vectors of reachable states.

Proposition 8. Let G be a group with squeezed passive
representations Sa(g) : g € G and Sp(g) : g € G on
input system A and output system B with respective sets
of inequivalent irreps M4 and Mg in the space of anni-
hilation and creation operators.

5 Note that we have used dt instead of d to include the case where
d is expressed in the basis defined by creation and annihilation
operators, where, in general, d is complex.

12

Given any quantum state p with first moment da,
there exists a Gaussian channel that is covariant un-
der input/output representations S4,S_ and maps p to
a state with first moment dg if and only if

supp (re (dedi,)) C supp (zi (dad',)) , (48)

for all w € (Ma Mz) \ {terivia}, where [trivial is the
trivial irrep and T“ is defined in Eq.(47).

We defer the full proof to Appendix C3.

D. Example: SU(2)-covariant amplifiers and
attenuators

Recall the Schwinger boson representation of SU(2) in
Eq.(28), defined on two modes with annihilation opera-
tors @ and @ . Consider general Gaussian bosonic chan-
nels on this system, and let X,Y be matrices describing
the action of such channel in phase space via Eq.(7). For
SU(2)-covariant channels, the displacement vector € is
zero, and the matrices X and Y satisfy

[X,SU)|=0, s(U)ys(U)T=yY, (49)

for all U € SU(2), where S(U) is the symmetry repre-
sentation defined in Eq.(28), which in the (41,42, a4, a4)
basis is given by

S(U) =U @U*: UE Ssu(2). (50)

Using the fact that U* = QTUQ, this representation
can be decomposed into two copies of the defining repre-
sentation of SU(2),

(I2 ®Q)(U @U*)\(I2 ®NT) =U SU ZUBh, (51)

for all U € SU(2). As we show in Appendix C 4, a general
matrix X that commutes with the action of symmetry
takes the following form in the (#1, 1, %2, p2) basis,

X = ef2 (v4.4 + x_e%2 X_) (52)

for arbitrary ri € R and 6,¢ € [0, 27), where

X_=@Z=(ZO0Z)Vis (5) =(Z@-Z)SWir

in the (£1, p1,%2,p2) basis. Here, Z = diag(1,—1) isa
Pauli matrix, and SWi2 is the swap of modes 1 and 2.

Note that X_ is an orthogonal but non-symplectic ma-
trix, satisfying X4 = Jy. In the Hilbert space, it corre-
sponds to the anti-unitary transformation

X_=CN; (5) = Cexp(inJy) ; (54)
where C is the anti-unitary corresponding to complex
conjugation in the common igenbosis of #@1,%2, and
Jy = = ilde, Jz] = (4a. — aah). The second expres-
sion in Eq.(54) has the same form as the time-reversal
operator on spin 1/2 systems. Indeed, under an the
angular momentum operators acquire a minus sign,

X_SyX2! =-Sy, for wé {x,y,z}, (55)

which means that X_ acts as time reversal if the two
modes describe an angular momentum degree of free-
dom. On the other hand, if the two modes describe, e.g.
two independent mechanical oscillators, then the time-
reversal transformation is simply complex. conjugation in
the & basis, ie. C, whereas X_ acts as (X_w)(x1, 22) =
(x2, -21)* on the wavefunction.

As an anti-unitary, X_ can be physically realized only
when the process adds a sufficient amount of noise to
the system, which is captured by matrix Y. In fact, the
only symmetric matrices Y that satisfy the invariance
condition in Eq.(49) are of the form Y = yl4, y € R in
the (#1, 1, £2, p2) basis, as can be seen by imposing that
Eq.(52) is equal to its transpose. This leads to the fol-
lowing complete-positivity condition for 2-mode SU(2)—
covariant channels,

y> Vl (ee

which is independent of phases ¢, 6.

Up to a global phase shift e®°? at the output of the
channel, the matrix X is specified by two real parame-
ters 4 and a phase 6. Two special cases of interest are
channels with X = x41, and X = x_X_, which are anal-
ogous to phase-covariant and phase-contravariant chan-
nels discussed in Section HITE. In fact, Eq.(56) reduces
to the complete-positivity condition for these channels
when x_ = 0 and x, = 0, respectively. However, un-
like in the case of U(1) symmetry, since SU(2) is self
dual, both types of channels are covariant for the same
system. These channels can be interpreted as SU(2)—
covariant amplifiers and attenuators. In particular, for
x— = 0 channels with |x,| > 1 and |r;| < 1 are SU(2)-
covariant amplifiers and attenuators, respectively.
t can then be shown that under such channels, an in-
put with a non-zero displacement vector can be mapped
to an output with an arbitrary displacement vector. In
other words, as long as the input displacement vector is
non-zero, SU(2) symmetry and Gaussianity do not re-
strict the displacement of the output state. Note that
the space of displacement vectors on two modes is a 4D
real vector space, which is consistent with the fact that
matrices X satisfying Eq.(52) also form a 4D real space
(indeed, this space carries a quaternionic structure). Of
course, these constraints do restrict the covariance matrix
of the output, ensuring that monotonicity of asymmetry
and Gaussian asymmetry monotones, as discussed below,
is not violated.

We conclude by applying Proposition 8 to this exam-
ple, which immediately implies that, for inputs with non-
zero displacement, the displacement vector of the out-
puts is unrestricted. The matrix K in Eq.(46) takes
the form J @Q. Acting on the displacement vector
d = ((a1), (a2), (1)", (@2)*)™, this gives

Kd = ((a1), (az), —(@2)", (@)")". (57)

The matrix T(dd') is obtained by taking the partial trace
over the multiplicity subsystem with respect to the tensor
product decomposition defined in Eq.(51):

supp(T(dd')) = oon { (ei) j ee) \ . (58)

Note that T(dd") has full support, i.e. rank(T(dd')) =
2, unless both (41) and (@2) vanish, in which case T(dd')
is zero, as can be seen by taking the determinant of the
matrix whose columns are given in Eq.(58). As we discuss
in the next section, rank(T'(dd')) is a Gaussian asymme-
try monotone.

V. GAUSSIAN ASYMMETRY MONOTONES

Monotones are used in resource theories to quantify
how resourceful a state is. Within the context of Gaus-
sian asymmetry, we define monotones as follows.

Definition 9. Suppose all bosonic systems under con-
sideration are equipped with Gaussian unitary represen-
tations of a group G. We call a function from the set
of quantum states of these systems to the non-negative
real numbers a Gaussian asymmetry monotone if it is
non-increasing under Gaussian G—covariant operations.

If a Gaussian asymmetry monotone depends solely on
the displacement vector or the covariance matrix of the
quantum state, we further call it a type-1 or type-2
asymmetry monotone, respectively.

It immediately follows that all Gaussian asymmetry
monotones remain conserved under (reversible) closed
Gaussian dynamics that respect the symmetry.

For instance, all asymmetry monotones [5, 82-87],
such as the relative entropy of asymmetry [82, 88] and
quantum Fisher information metrics (20, 84], are non-
increasing under all covariant operations and, there-
fore, also under Gaussian covariant operations, which
are a special case. Consequently, they are automati-
cally Gaussian asymmetry monotones. Similarly, any
non-Gaussianity monotone, such as the Wigner nega-
tivity [89], relative entropy of non-Gaussianity [90], and
stellar rank [91] are monotones for Gaussian asymmetry.
Note that monotones that are faithful, i.e. achieve a min-
imum if and only if the state is free, in the theories of
asymmetry or non-Gaussianity are not generally faithful
in the theory of Gaussian asymmetry.
A. Relative entropy of asymmetry

An entropic monotone, commonly considered in re-
source theories [9], is the relative entropy of resource I.
In the case . asymmetry, consider the twirling opera-
tion [5] T(p) = f dg S(g)pS(g)', where the integral is
taken ue ie to the Haar measure dg of group G
with unitary representation g ++ S(g). Then,

T(p) = inf S. (Alle)

= Sv(AllT(0)) = Su(T(d)) — So(A) (59)

where F is the set of bosonic quantum states that are
invariant under the action of the symmetry group G, and
he von Neumann entropy S,, of state p is

8.(A) = —tr[plog(A)) (60)

In analogy with other quantum resource theories, func-
ion T is often called the relative entropy of asymmetry®.

Note that if, instead, we define [ by taking F to be
he set of Gaussian G-invariant states, then I is faithful
in the resource theory of Gaussian asymmetry, but. it
ecomes harder to compute, as the last two equations in
Eq.(59) do not hold in general.

Consider the 1-mode U(1) representation e 1
ei! Ty Appendix C5, we calculate the relative en-
ropy of asymmetry of # in terms of its mean pho-
on number (n) := tr[fata] for pure coherent and
squeezed states. In particular, for a coherent state

a) = D(Re(a),Im(a))7 19);

1
T(laXal) = 5 log(n) +1og(V2re) + O((n)~*), (61)
where (n) = |a|?. Similarly, for a squeezed state |r) =

exp(r(al? - a’) |0),
T(|r\(r|) = log(n) + log (2-8 re?) +o(1), (62)

where (n) = sinh? r, and y ® 0.577 is the Buler—
Mascheroni constant. We plot both monotones in Fig. 3.

The relative entropy of asymmetry can be extended
by considering the weighted twirling operation,

T(6) = / dg p(9)$(9)A8(9)" , (63)

where pis a distribution over group elements. Ay pis sharp
at some group element g € G, then 7,() = (9)pS(g)t.
On the other hand, if p is the uniform fae: over

6 The quantity S,,(7(A)) — Sv() was first introduced in Ref. [82],
and was called ee Then, in Ref. [88], it was shown that
it can be expressed in terms of the relative entropy.

FIG. 3. Relative entropy of asymmetry for 1—mode
states. We consider 1-mode U(1) symmetry and calculate
the Holevo asymmetry I of coherent states |a) and squeezed
vacuum states |r) as a function of mean photon number (n).
The maximum mean photon number (n) = 50 in the plot
corresponds to |a| = /50 © 7.07 and r = sinh™! (/50) =
2.65. The dashed lines represent the asymptotic behavior of
the monotone as r,|a| — oo. For (n) < 8.54, coherent states
have a larger relative entropy of asymmetry, whereas squeezed
states exhibit the dominant asymptotic behavior.

G, then J, = T is the twirling operation. Then, one can
define the so-called Holevo asymmetry monotones [5],

TP, (6) = Sv(Tp(0))

for some distribution p over the group G. In addition
to the relative entropy of asymmetry, and its generaliza-
tion to Holevo asymmetry measures, an important class
of asymmetry monotones with clear operational inter-
pretations is obtained from the quantum Fisher informa-
tion [20, 21, 84]. For further approaches to constructing
asymmetry monotones, see [5].

Based on the split of Gaussian asymmetry into type-1
and type-2 asymmetry, we may ask whether we can simi-
larly construct separate monotones for each type. Indeed,
we provide such examples in the following sections.

— Sv(6), (64)

B. Type—1 asymmetry monotones

We present a family of functions that depend solely
on the first moments of states and are monotone under
covariant Gaussian channels. Recall the setting of Propo-
sition 8. For each irrep jz of a symmetry group G and
for any, possibly non-Gaussian, state p with displacement
vector d, define the integer

f(A) := rank (qi! (aa')) . (65)

FIG. 4. Type-1 asymmetry. Suppose a G—covariant Gaus-
sian channel € sends an input state f; to an output state po.
Then, there exists a G-covariant Gaussian channel €’ that

maps pi, = DY) (Ar) to 62 = DS (Ar).

The monotonicity of this quantity under covariant Gaus-
sian channels follows immediately from Eq.(48). Since
the support of T“) (dgdi,) for the output state is con-
tained in the support of T) (dad) for the input state,
its dimension cannot be larger.

It is also clear that f,, is an integer bounded by d,,, the
dimension of irrep jz. In particular, for Abelian groups,
it can only take values 0 or 1, indicating whether or not
the first moment of the state has a component in a mode
that supports irrep pu.

C. Type-2 asymmetry monotones

Here, we present a general recipe for constructing
type-2 Gaussian asymmetry monotones, based on the
notion of type-1 asymmetry—destroying maps. One
can define the type-1 asymmetry-destroying map DY 5
(d,o) + (0,c) that removes the first moment d of a state
p. This map explicitly depends on input d and can be
realized as a displacement D(A) = D_apDa.

Consider a Gaussian G-covariant channel € whose ac-
tion in phase space is described by X,Y,€ according to
Eq.(7), such that €(/1) = fy for states p1, P2 with first
moments d;,d2. We can fully remove the type—1 asym-
metry in the input/output states by applying appropri-

ate displacements, obtaining states DY (#1) and DY (p2)
with vanishing first moments. Then, the Gaussian G—
covariant channel €’ described by X,Y,0 according to
Eq.(7), maps Dy (p1) to Dy (62), as depicted’ in Fig. 4.

Given an asymmetry monotone f, we can construct
a type-2 asymmetry monotone f® : p > f(DY (A),
where DY is the type-1 asymmetry-destroying map that

7 One can similarly define a type-2 asymmetry-destroying map
that sends the covariance matrix o of a state f to a fixed co-
variance matrix that respects the symmetry such as the identity
I for passive representations. However, in general, one cannot
guarantee the existence of a covariant channel €’ that maps the
transformed input state to the corresponding transformed out-
put state, as depicted in Fig. 4 (for instance, this is the case for
1-mode phase-insensitive amplifiers with U(1) symmetry).

depends on the first moment d of input state p. Then,
using the notation of Fig. 4,

F (DEP (E(r))) = FEY (r))) S$ (OY (Ar), (66)

because €’ is a G-covariant operation. We proceed to
give concrete examples of type-2 asymmetry monotones
in the next section.

D. Petz-Rényi relative entropy of asymmetry

Here, we give a recipe for deriving Gaussian asym-
metry monotones and corresponding type-2 asymmetry
monotones, providing some examples that take explicit
closed forms for Gaussian states.

Given any divergence D and any group element g € G,
the quantity f(A) = D(A||$(g)ASt(g)) is an asymmetry
monotone for unitary representation S' of G. Concretely,

for any p € B(H) and G-covariant € : B(H) > B(H),
FalE(A)) = D(E(ANIE(S(9)AS"(9)))
< D(A|S(9)AS"(9)) = fol). (67)
where the first equality follows because € is covariant
and the inequality is the data-processing inequality that

divergence D needs to satisfy.
Consider the Petz-Rényi a—divergence [92],

26 1 xegci ,
Dall?) = —logtrlp"7!-"], (68)

defined for a € (0,1) U (1,00). This quantity has
been calculated explicitly [93] in terms of the displace-
ment vector and covariance matrix of any two Gaussian
states 6,7, for a € (0,1). For our purposes, consider
fog = Dal S(g)AS(g)'), where f has first moment d
and covariance matrix a. We find in Appendix C 6 that

fase = ae (F230) + FO) » (69)
I923(0) = dy (0a + S(g)71-05(9)") "dy, (70)

Fa = coth(a coth™!(ciM)) iQ, (72)

for a € (0,1), is the covariance matrix of p°/tr[p%],
ie. the thermal state of Hamiltonian H at temperature
(a8)~1, where f is the thermal state of Hamiltonian H at
temperature 8~!. This follows from the well-known rela-
tion oiQ = coth (FiQH) between the covariance matrix o
of state p and the Hamiltonian matrix H of H. Inserting
this relation in Eq.(72) gives oi = coth (ZiQ(aH)).
Note that if f is pure, so is p*/tr[6*] and oq = o for
all a € (0,1). Then, Eqs.(70,71) simplify to

a p)= a; (o + S(g)oS(g)") dy, (73)
fQ(A) = 5 losdet [(o + S(g)oS(9)") /2]. (74)

We emphasize that the expressions in Eqs.(69—71,73,7
are not valid for non-Gaussian states.
Under closed covariant dynamics, the monotone fog
is conserved, since Ineq.(67) holds as equality. If the
(1) p(2)

dynamics is Gaussian, both fa,g, fa,g are independently

conserved, i.e. e any invariant Gaussian unitary U, it
is evident that fi! *) (OpUt) = = fs (A); for k= 1,2.

Under open dynamics, the quantity ree is a monotone
for type-2 asymmetry due to Eq.(66). We can rewrite
FE) for a = 1/2 as follows,

which expresses the ratio of the purity of state p1/2 over
the overlap between state p1/2 with removed displace-
ment vector and its rotation by g € G.

Consider the U(1) symmetry generated by a purely
quadratic observable Q, given by S(t = ei with asso-
ciated symplectic matrix S(t) = e~°°*. In Appendix C7,
we show that, for this continuous symmetry, we obtain
additional monotones of Gaussian asymmetry and type—
2 asymmetry as the second derivatives Fg of fio, and

FD) of (O)

Fo = FS) + FY (76)
FQ? (A) = —d™Q005',0Qd, (77)
FQ) (p)= itr [Qo HIMQ, 71 9] . (78)

Note that if Q commutes with 2, then FS (A) attains a
zero value for every state with o1/2 = I, e.g. the vacuum.
On the contrary, if Q does not commute with 2, then the
representation is not passive (see Fig. 2), so, for example,
the vacuum is no longer a free state.

As an example, consider free evolution with frequency
w, ie. Q =wI, on 1 mode. For a coherent state |), we

have f2)(\7)) = 0, and

foe(l7)) = Far (ly)) = 21 = cos(wt))I9/?, (79)

o as Noether’s theo-
in the presence of rotational SU(2)

symmetry, the angular momentum operators remain con-

served. More genera!

ly, for a symmetry group G, if an

initial state p evolves under a symmetry-respecting uni-
tary into a final state p’, then we have

tr[AU(g)| = trla'U(9)],

or all g EG. (83)
If the group is generated by an observable Q such that
U(s) = e255 ER, we find that,

[AQ] = tr['Q"].

In the aforementioned example of SU(2) symmetry, this
equation implies that all expectation values of polynomi-
als of angular momentum operators remain conserved.
When # is a pure state, Eq.(83) captures all the im-
plications of the symmetry in the following sense: if this
conservation law holds for all g € G, then there exists
a unitary transformation V that respects the symmetry,
e. [V,U(g) |= = 0 for all g € G, and converts between the
two states p’ = VpVt (ays.
Clearly, if the dynamics of a closed system that re-
spects the symmetry is Gaussian, they satisfy the conser-
vation laws in Eqs.(83,84). This naturally raises the fol-
lowing question: Are there conservation laws that are sat-
isfied by Gaussian closed systems that respect the
metry, but are not necessarily satisfied by non-Gaussian
closed systems that respect the symmetry? In other
words, does the presence of symmetries in Gaussian sys-
tems impose any additional constraints on the dynamics?
In the following, we show that the answer is affirmative,
and we present a class of such conservation laws.
The intuition is simple: conservation laws of the form
given in Eq.(84) only consider the total amount of charge
in the system. However, roughly speaking, the conserved

(84)

8 Tt is worth noting that this does not generally hold when # is
mixed; in fact, the conservation of measures of asymmetry im-
poses independent conservation laws on the dynamics of the sys-
tem that are not captured by Eq.(83) [83].
charge and asymmetry can be decomposed into different
components corresponding to central moments of differ-
ent order, which do not mix under Gaussian dynamics
that respect the symmetry. Therefore, by analyzing the
contributions to charge and asymmetry in these differ-
ent central moments, one can identify new independent
conserved quantities.

A. Conservation laws for closed Gaussian systems

Suppose that under a Gaussian unitary evolution de-
scribed by V, an arbitrary, possibly non-Gaussian, initial
state p, with displacement vector d; and covariance ma-
trix 01, evolves to the final state p2 = VpiV"', with dis-
placement vector dy and covariance matrix a2. Suppose
further that V is invariant under a symplectic Gaussian
representation of symmetry e’’@ with quadratic charge

Q=SlQpnrite, Q=Q", (85)

ik

for all r € R, which corresponds to representation e~"2@
in the phase space. Then,

diQd, =d3Qd2, —_tr[o1Q] = tr[oeQ]. (86)

Crucially, while in a Gaussian charge-conserving closed
system each of these quantities is individually con-
served, this is not generally the case in non-Gaussian
charge-conserving closed systems. We provide a counter-
example in Section VIB. Instead, due to Eq.(84) for
k=1, tr[piQ] = tr[poQ], which, in turn, implies the
following linear combination remains conserved,

tr [o,Q] + 2d? Qd, = tr [o2Q] + 2d} Qdy. (87)

To derive more general conservation laws, we first estab-
lish the following simple result.

Lemma 10. Consider the function
F(A) = tr[f(A2, 2B), (88)

where A and B are (2n x 2n) matrices, and f is any
arbitrary non-commutative polynomial. Under any sym-
plectic transformation V € Sp(2n,R) that commutes with
OB, i.e. [V,QB] = 0, we have

Fp(A) = Fa(VAV"). (89)

Proof. For any invertible matrix V,
tr[f(AQ, QB)| = tr[V f(AQ, AB)V—*] (90)
=trif(VAQV-!,VOQBV—')} (91)
= tr(f(VAV7Q,QB)), (92)

where the second equality follows from the pro
erty Vf(X,Y)V-t = f(VXV-1VYV~—!) of non-
commutative polynomials, and the third from the as-
sumptions that [V, QB] = 0 and that V is symplectic.

17

For instance, choosing f(X,Y) = (XY)*, for integer
k, and A = o, we obtain Fg(A) = tr[(AB)*]. Then,
assuming V commutes with QQ for Q in Eq.(85), choos-
ing B = Q leads to the conserved quantity Fg(A) =
tr [(AQ)*], which in turn implies the conservation law

Similarly, if the Gaussian unitary V respects a group
G with symplectic representation S : G — Sp(2n,R),
then choosing B = —0QS(g) yields the conservation law

tr [(0125(g))*] = tr [(722S(g))*] . (94)

for every group element g € G.

Example: SU(2) symmetry and conservation of
angular momentum

Recall the SU(2) example with the angular operators
defined in Eq.(27). Let djq and oj,q denote the displace-
ment vector and covariance matrix of mode a in sub-
system j, and let d;» and oj, denote the displacement
vector and covariance matrix of mode b in subsystem j.

The expectation value tr[pJ-] remains conserved under
general SU(2)-invariant dynamics, and, if the dynamics
is also Gaussian, Eq.(86) implies the independent conser-
vation of the following two quantities,

> (Gadia - A ydi,») ; 5 (trloj.0 - trlo;.1) .

j=l j=l
(95)

B. Violation of conservation laws in non-Gaussian
closed systems

Consider a single mode with U(1) representation
exp(igata), @ € {0,27), which corresponds to the con-
served charge Q = @@ and Q = In is the (2 x 2) iden-
tity matrix. Consider a system initially in the pure co-
herent state ja) :-= Da, |0), with first moment dy =
V2(Re(qa), Im(a)), and covariance matrix 71 = In, and
suppose it evolves to state J |a), where U = I —2|0\O| is
a non-Gaussian U(1)-invariant unitary. Under this trans-
formation, the state’s displacement vector and covariance
matrix become

dy = cd,, (96)
o2 = (1+ (1—c)d{dy)In + 2c(l—c)did; , (97)

where c := 1 —2e7!¢l’, Although the conservation law in
Eq.(87) still holds, i.e.

tr [(oe + 2d) Q| =2(1+2la\2), (98)
for k = 1,2, the conservation laws in Eq.(86) are not sat-
isfied for non-zero displacement a. It is worth noting that
a non-zero displacement at the input causes the output
covariance matrix to acquire off-diagonal elements. As a
result, it no longer commutes with (, and so, unlike the
input covariance matrix, it breaks the U(1) symmetry.

C. A complete set of conservation laws for
incoherent states

An important case of interest is when the symme-
try is represented by a passive quadratic charge Q. Let
Q= eackig(Q) qll, be the spectral decomposition of the
symmetric matrix Q, where II, is the projector on the
modes {j : qj = q} with charge g. Then, using Lemma 10,
one can directly obtain the conservation laws

tr [(o1 (ly — H_g))*] = tr [(o2(Ty-T1-4))*] , (99)

®

for |g| > 0 and all integers k. To see this, first note that
according to Proposition 1, [Q,Q] = 0 when Q is pas-
sive. Thus, any symplectic matrix that commutes with
QQ, also commutes with Q? = —(QQ)?, hence also with
projectors to the eigenspaces of Q?, namely IL, +II_, for
q € Eig(Q). This holds because each Hy + H_, can be
written as a polynomial p, of Q?, ice.

My, + T-4 = Pq(—(Q2)*) = Pq(Q?) :

It follows that by choosing f(X,Y) = (XYp,(-Y?))* in
Proposition 10, and A = o and B = Q, we obtain the
above conservation laws.

The conservation laws in Eq.(99) only restrict sectors
with g £0. In the sectors with g = 0, the symmetry does
not impose any restrictions. Nevertheless, the fact that
the dynamics is closed and Gaussian imposes non-trivial
constraints on the dynamics, namely,

(100)

tr[(o12T9)*] = tr[(o2210)*) , (101)
The above equations can be equivalently stated as equal-
ity of symplectic eigenvalues of 01 IIo and o2IIo on modes
with zero charge, and equality of ordinary eigenvalues of
oy (II, — Iq] and 03/1, — I_,] on modes with non-zero
charge, i.e.

SympEig (oi IIo) = SympEig (o2IIo), g=0,
(102)

Eig(oi (II, — _q)) = Eig(o2(Ily —H_-q)), q #0.
(103)

We emphasize that, for any covariance matrix o, matrix
o(II, — H_,) is indeed diagonalizable, and the number
of its positive and negative eigenvalues is equal to the
number of modes with charge |q| and —|q|, respectively?.

18

Interestingly, it turns out that for Gaussian states that:
(i) have a vanishing displacement vector, and (ii) contain
no coherence with respect to the charge Q, these conser-
vation laws capture all the implications of symmetry: if
they hold, then there exists a G-invariant Gaussian uni-
tary transformation that converts one into the other. In
particular, we show the following statement.

Theorem 11. Consider a symmetric matriz

Q= S ql, ,

qcEig(Q)

(104)

such that [Q,Q] = 0, where Ty projects on the sector with

charge q, i.e. on modes {j : qj = q}-
Suppose 01,02 are two covariance matrices such that
{o1, QQ] = [o2,0Q] =0. (105)

Then, there exists a symplectic transformation S_ such
that SQST = Q and SoS" = 02 if and only if conditions

tr[(o1 OM)*] = tr[(c2T)*] ,
r [(o1 (Hy T_q))*] tr [(o2(Iy T_g))*] >

hold for all |\q| > 0 and integers k.

(106)
(107)

The proof is deferred to Appendix D2. Note that one
only needs to check the conditions of Eqs.(106,107) for
k < n(q), where n(q) is the total number of modes {j :
|q;| = lal} with charge +q.
Theorem 11 allows one to determine what quantum
states are reachable from a given initial state via invari-
ant symplectic transformations. As an example, suppose
a system of n modes is initially prepared in a product
of uncorrelated thermal states, with covariance matrix
Bj vjlz. Then, a Gaussian state with covariance ma-
trix o is reachable from this state via a charge-conserving
symplectic transformation if and only if

Big (Ty ~T1-)) = { 45 : yl =a},

for all |q| > 0, and SympEig (oi IIo) = SympEig (c2IIo).
We conclude that

its positive, negative and zero eigenvalues, are equal to those
of B. To see this consider the similarity transformation AB —+
A~1/2 4BA!/2, This implies AB is similar to A!/2BA!/2. Then,
applying the Sylvester’s law of inertia, we find that the number
of positive, negative, and zero eigenvalues of B is equal to those
of A!/?BA!/?, and thus to those of AB. Applying this to A =
(IIg + W_q)o(IIq + W_—q) and B = Q proves the claim.
where we have defined op := II,oII, to be the restriction
of covariance matrix o on the modes with charge p.
Similarly, for k = 2 we obtain
2 2 2 2
llogll2 + llo-qll2 — 2lloq,-all2 = Ss v;, (109)

where || All := (tr[A?])1/?, and o,,-4 = II,oT_,

Concretely, consider the sy: mmetry generated. ‘by Q=

the invariant covariance matrices take the form

for 411,422, a12 > 0 and 6 € (0,27). Then, the conserva-

We conclude that, once any of a11, G22, or @12 is chosen,
the other two are uniquely determined.

D. Extension of Williamson’s theorem
(simultaneous normal mode decomposition)

In this section, we establish a symmetric extension of
Williamson’s seminal theorem [68, 94], which is a critical
step in the proof of Theorem 11.

The content of Williamson’s theorem [68] is that any
(2n x 2n) real symmetric positive-definite matrix M can
e diagonalized by congruence using a symplectic ma-
rix S, such that the symplectic eigenvalues appear in
airs, ie. SMST = Ojai vjIz for real positive v;,
where Jy denotes the (2 x 2) identity matrix. It has re-
cently been shown [95] that two (2n x 2n) real symmetric
positive-definite matrices M), M2 can be symplectically
diagonalized by congruence using one symplectic matrix
if and only if Md, and M2 symplectically commute, i.e.
QMy,QMo] = 0. In such a scenario, we say that My, and
Mp admit a simultaneous normal mode decomposition.

For applications in the context of symmetry, we need
o consider a different extension of Williamson’s theorem,
in which two (2n x 2n) real symmetric matrices M and Q
are given, with only M required to be positive-definite,
and find necessary and sufficient conditions for M and Q
o admit a simultaneous normal-mode decomposition.

Theorem 12. Let M and Q be (2n x 2n) real symmetric
matrices, such that M is positive-definite and [Q,Q] = 0.

19

Then, there exists a symplectic matrix S that diago-
nalizes both Q and M by congruence,

SMSt = Dube 5 2D, (113)
j=l

SQST=Dah, weER, (114)
j=l

if and only if M and Q satisfy
(QM, 2Q] =0,
where In denotes the (2 x 2) identity matrix.
The proof is deferred to Appendix D1. Note that the
condition in Eq.(115) can be equivalently stated as
(QM, XQ] = [O.M, Q] = [M,Q] =0. (116)
If Q is taken as the symmetric matrix that corresponds
to a conserved charge Q and M is a Hamiltonian matrix
or the covariance matrix of a quantum state, the first
commutation relation in Eq.(115) represents invariance

(115)

of M under the symmetry generated by Q. The second
commutation relation in Eq.(115) implies that the charge
is passive. The standard Williamson’s theorem [68] corre-
sponds to the special case of trivial symmetry, i.e. Q = 0.

Normal mode decomposition when all charges q; are
equal, i.e. Q = qI, q € R is an important special case of
Theorem 12, and we highlight it here.

Proposition 13. For any Gaussian state p with covari-
ance matriz o, the following statements are equivalent:

(1) The covariance matrix satisfies [o,Q] = 0;

(2) There exists a passive symplectic Gaussian unitary
S such that, up to displacement,

n e Bi ala;

Spst = &@) ——_— (117)

B54 al a; ie
is a product of thermal states with 8; > 0;

(3) The covariance matrix consists of (2 x 2) blocks de-
scribing correlations between modes j and k, that
have the form ox = ajx exp(9j4Q), with azn = an,
and 0; = —Ox3 for all j,k =1,...,n.

aut (1) => (2). If [o,Q]) = 0, the charge matrix

= q@j_, 2 satisfies both assumptions in Eq.(115)
q Theorem 12, which then implies that there exists a
symplectic matrix $ such that SMST = Dy-1 vjIz and
Sst = Oy In. The RHS in the former equation is ex-
actly the covariance matrix of the thermal states in the

RHS of Eq.(117) with 8; = log (44), while the latter

equation ensures that S is passive.
(2) = (3). This follows immediately from the form o:

all U(1)-invariant matrices given in Eq.(44).
(3) > (1). The form of oj, directly yields (1).

Proposition 13 is the main result of Ref. [96], where it was
derived with no reference to symmetry considerations.

VII. COVARIANT GAUSSIAN DILATION

Any Gaussian channel can be realized via a Gaussian
unitary that acts on the system and on an environment
prepared in a Gaussian pure state [67], a result which
extends the Stinespring dilation theorem [97]. In this
section, we generalize this result to show that any covari-
ant Gaussian channel can be realized via a symmetry-
respecting Gaussian unitary that acts on the system and
on an environment prepared in a Gaussian pure state
hat also respects the symmetry. To prove this gener-
alization, we develop an approach for constructing such
dilations, which is different from both the proof of the
aforementioned result for Gaussian channels in the ab-
sence of symmetries [67] and the proof of the covariant
Stinespring dilation theorem for finite-dimensional sys-
tems, which relies on the Kraus decomposition [5]. Natu-
rally, the symplectic representations under consideration
are assumed to admit invariant states, which, by Propo-
sition 3, implies that they are squeezed passive represen-
tations. We start by a quick review of Gaussian purifi-
cations which play a key role in our main proof of the
dilation theorem (see Fig. 6 for a proof sketch).

A. Invariant Gaussian purification

Consider an n-mode system A and a symmetry group
G with symplectic Gaussian representation S4(g):g € G
in Hilbert space H4. Given any mixed Gaussian state
p € B(Ha) that is invariant under representation S'4,
does there exist a purification |) € H4 ® Hq of p that
is Gaussian, and invariant under tensor representation
S4 @ Sq, for an ancillary system A and an appropriately
chosen representation $3? The answer is positive as we
show in Appendix E1, and, analogously to the case of
discrete-variable systems [98], we prove in Appendix E2
that it is unique up to a symmetry-respecting Gaussian
unitary on the ancilla. We sketch the construction of
such purification in Fig. 5.
Lemma 14 (Invariant Gaussian purification). Consider
a system with a finite number of bosonic modes and
Hilbert space Ha equipped with symplectic Gaussian rep-
resentation S4(g):g€G of a group G. Let pa € B(Ha)

be an invariant state, i.e. Sa(g)paSa(g)' = pa for all
g €G. Then, the following statements hold true.

(i) There exists a Gaussian pure state |) 44 € Ha ®

FIG. 5. Circuit for purification. We consider an invari-
ant Gaussian state #4 with covariance matrix ¢ = VDV",
for symplectic V and diagonal D > I. Registers A and A
oth comprise n modes. The circuit operates in three steps:

(i) preparation of the vacuum state on both registers, (ii)
coupling of the two registers via n 2—mode squeezers, each
depending on a symplectic eigenvalue in D and depicted by
an arched line inside the box, and (iii) symplectic rotation
on each of the registers A and A (V and V’ are associated
with symplectic matrices V and VQ, respectively). Overall
this circuit realizes the purification |y) with covariance matrix
oy = (VOVO)Vasq( 5 cosh™* D)Vasq(5 cosh™* D)"(V@VQ)*,
as given in Eq.(120). Lemma 14 proves that this is an invari-
ant Gaussian purification of and guarantees that it is unique
up to an invariant Gaussian unitary U0 applied on the ancil-
lary register A according to Eq.(121). We note that steps
(i), (ii) and (iii) are generally not individually invariant, but
Proposition 6 gives a G-invariant Gaussian unitary that pre-
pares oy, from a G-invariant state that is uncorrelated across
A and A which, however, requires the implementation of the
globally correlated symplectic transformation /aj.

covariance matriz of state pa, respectively, then,

where O is the zero vector on A, Za = (Ia ® Z),
and Q is the symplectic form on A.

space Hp equipped with symplectic Gaussian repre-
sentation Sp(g):g €G. Tf ltn) ap and |{2) 4p are

fork =1,2 and allg € G, then there exists a Gaus-
sian unitary Ug that commutes with representation
Sp(g):g €G such that

12) ap = (is ® on) Wa) ap - (121)

We note that the purification given in Eq.(120) is a slight
modification of the Gaussian purification!® previously
found by Holevo and Werner [69]. We also emphasize
that invariance is considered at the state vector level, i.e.
(Sa(9) ® Sa(9)) 4) 45 = |¥) ap» for all g € G. This
is a stronger condition than the density operator being
GHinvariant, requiring that the state vector itself must
carry the trivial representation of the group, as opposed
to a general non-trivial one-dimensional representation.

B. Covariant Gaussian dilation

Equipped with invariant Gaussian purifications, we
are ready to establish covariant Gaussian dilations of co-
variant Gaussian channels. Recall that Gaussian chan-
nels are completely Gaussianity-preserving CPTP opera-
tions (see Appendix F 1), ie. CPTP maps which send
Gaussian states to Gaussian states, even when acting
only on a subsystem of a larger Gaussian system.

Theorem 15 (Covariant Gaussian dilation). Consider a
pair of systems A and B with finite numbers of bosonic
modes and Hilbert spaces Ha and Hg. Suppose each sys-
tem is equipped with a symplectic Gaussian representa-
tion of a group G that admits an invariant state (as char-
acterized in Proposition 3), denoted by Sa(g): 9 € G,
and Sp(g) 2g € G, respectively.

For any Gaussian channel € : B(Ha) + B(Hp) that
is covariant, i.e. E(Sa(g)(-)Sa(g)t) = Sp(g)E(-)Sa(g)t
for all g € G, there exists a dilation of the form

£0) = try5 [Vann (() © lMalop) Vian] > (122)

where ancilla B has Hilbert space Hz = Hp equipped
with representation Sp(g) = S%(g) : g € G, where the
complex conjugate is defined in the common eigenbasis of
position operators, In) BB is an invariant pure Gaussian

state, i.c. (Sa(9) ® Sp(9)) In) pn = Im) pp for all g € G,
and Vypp is a symplectic Gaussian unitary that com-
mutes with representation Si, (9) @Sp(g)@S5(9) :g€G.

Furthermore, |n) gp can be chosen to be uncorrelated
between B and B.

Fig. 6 provides a sketch of the proof based on the notion
of invariant purification and decoupling. The complete
proof is deferred to Appendix F 2, where we also present
a phase space version of the statement and the converse
of the theorem. Note that when the symmetry repre-
sentations are trivial, we obtain the dilation of Gaussian
channels, which was previously shown [32, 67] using a
different approach.

10 The original Gaussian purification [69] considers covariance ma-
trix Z4oy,Z,, which results in a symplectic form Q.4®—Q4 that
is reflected on the second subsystem. Other Gaussian purifica-
tions have been considered, e.g. in Ref. [30], but they generally
do not respect the symmetries of the original state.

FIG. 6. Gaussian Stinespring dilation via purifica-
tion and decoupling. Our proof of Theorem 15 provides a
constructive method for implementing a covariant Gaussian
channel € using G-invariant Gaussian unitaries that couple
the system to an environment in a G-invariant Gaussian pure
state. First, the channel is applied to the subsystem A of
a composite system AA, initially prepared in a G-invariant
Gaussian pure state |7) ,z, resulting in state 7,4. In step (i),
we construct a G-invariant Gaussian purification of 7,7, de-
noted |®) ,z37%, whose existence is guaranteed by Lemma 14.
In step (ii), we decouple |®) ,z,% via a G-invariant Gaussian
unitary Vi es obtaining |%) ,q ® |n) _—, which is an equiv-
alent purification of pz := tra[|v)(¥|,_]. Lemma 14 ensures
that such a unitary exists. Therefore, if 6z is full rank, we
obtain the channel equality in Eq. (122). Note that X de-
notes a system whose Hilbert space is isomorphic to that of
system X but carries the complex conjugate representation of
symmetry. This approach to dilation can also be applied in
the setting of discrete variables.

Theorem 15 demonstrates that, for any symplectic
Gaussian representation, a (covariant) Gaussian channel
mapping n4 to ng modes is guaranteed to have a (co-
variant) Gaussian dilation with ancillary qubits prepared
in (pure) vacuum using at most 2ng ancillary modes.
Therefore, similar to the dilation of general Gaussian
channels, a covariant Gaussian channel from n4 to ng
modes can be realized by discarding an environment with
at most n4 + ng modes.

The fact that the ancilla state |7),— can be cho-
sen unentangled across the bipartition B : B follows
from Proposition 3, which guarantees that the symplectic
Gaussian representation Sg admits a G-invariant pure
state, together with Proposition 6 which states that G—
invariant Gaussian transformations act transitively on
he space of G-invariant Gaussian pure states.

It is worth noting that the proof of Theorem 15 pro-
vides a method to construct the dilating unitary V. One
nas freedom to choose an initial pure state |) ,z pro-
vided that its reduced state on A is full-rank and invari-
ant under input representation S4. Then, the purifica-
ion step (i) outlined in Fig. 6 constructs G-invariant
Gaussian state |®) ,a pp, ¢-g- using the purification in
Eq.(120). The decoupling step (ii) consists of identifying

a G-invariant symplectic Gaussian unitary V,4pg tha
maps between the two purifications of marginal state
tra[|YX%|4q]. This is done by first identifying an in-
tertwiner that maps between the modes in ABB thai
are correlated with modes in A, and then completing
it into a full G-invariant symplectic transformation (see
Appendix E3).

As an example, consider a Gaussian channel € tha’
acts on a system A with n modes equipped with U(1)

representation O(@) = Qj exp(i0qja'a;) with integer
charges q;. If € is covariant with respect to the U(1)
symmetry, i.e.

E(0(0)()0(0)") = O()E()O()", (123)

hen Theorem 15 implies that it can be realized by cou-
ling A to n-mode ancillary systems B with charges

{qj : j = 1,...,n}, and B with charges {-q; : j =
,---,m}, all initially prepared in vacuum Joye"

J(1)—invariant Gaussian unitaries.

, using

We obtain covariant Gaussian dilations for all 1-mode
hhase-insensitive, or, equivalently, energy-conserving,
channels via the constructive proof of Theorem 15 in Ap-
endix F 3. In particular, we directly find dilating uni-
aries for all attenuator and amplifier channels, which
are slight modifications of the standard dilating uni-
aries [30], guaranteeing U(1)—invariance.

VIII. SUMMARY & OUTLOOK

We develop a framework that characterizes symmetry-
respecting Gaussian dynamics in bosonic systems.
Within this framework, we demonstrate that asymmetry

22

splits into different types and derive families of mono-
tones that are tractable for Gaussian states, quantifying
asymmetry in the state’s displacement vector and covari-
ance matrix. We also derive a family of conservation laws
for Gaussian closed dynamics, some of which are violated
when the dynamics is non-Gaussian. Finally, we develop
a new approach to channel dilation which relies only on
an appropriate equivalence of purifications. In the pres-
ence of symmetries, our dilation provides a constructive
method of realizing covariant Gaussian channels via in-
variant Gaussian unitaries and pure states.

It is worth exploring the restrictions that phase space
representations of symmetry impose on the characteristic
unctions of quantum states, which may lead to practical
asymmetry witnesses. In particular, the characteristic
function gives rise to the s~ordered representations [99],
such as the Wigner, Glauber, and Hussimi representa-
ions, which are reconstructible in a lab [100, 101].

Our statement of channel dilation can be quantified
beyond the context of Gaussian covariant channels, by
asking the question of whether channels with limited
non-Gaussianity or asymmetry can be dilated via uni-
aries and ancillary states that themselves contain limited
non-Gaussianity or asymmetry as measured by a chosen
monotone. For instance, one could employ a monotone
such as the Wigner negativity [89] of non-Gaussian states,
and ask what quantum channels may be implemented via
Gaussian unitaries and ancillary states of fixed maximum
non-Gaussianity as quantified by the chosen monotone.

Fermions are the counterpart of bosons, following
canonical anti-commutation relations [102]. Besides their
natural significance, fermionic simulation is a promis-
ing path towards quantum advantage [103], in particu-
lar due to the Jordan-Wigner transform [104] which al-
lows fermionic simulation on qubit devices. Much like
for bosonic systems, fermionic Gaussian systems are the
most easily engineered, and so an analog of our analy-
sis of symmetric Gaussian dynamics can be useful in the
context of fermions as well. It may also be of interest
to investigate a resource theory of asymmetry on hybrid
setups of continuous and discrete variables.

In general, specific quantum information tasks, such
as property testing for Gaussian states [105], motivate
the study of specific symmetry representations. We hope
that our framework paves the way to exploring CV quan-
tum information tasks that hinge on Gaussian represen-
tations of symmetry.

Appendix A: Notation and background on Gaussian CV

1. Notation

The complex conjugate is denoted by star (*). The zero matrix is denoted by 0. The inequality A > B between
square matrices A, B of the same dimension means that A — B has non-negative eigenvalues. The space of bounded
linear operators for Hilbert space H is written as B(H). The qubit Pauli operators are denoted by I,X,Y,Z. We
denote an operator @ acting on the Hilbert space by a hat, and an operator a acting in phase space without the hat.

We use the shorthand 4+ H.c. = @

We follow Serafini’s notation [32
ab =, ajb;,

-T t rf D
and the outer product as 4b, with components [ab | .= ajby. Note that in general (aa") ~ aa
jk

a‘ for operator G. Vectors of operators, a or @, are denoted by boldface.
for calculations involving vectors of operators. We write the inner product as
ant

since operators Gj and Gy may not commute for 7 4 k. The commutators and anti-commutators of a list of operators

can thus be succinctly expressed as

ears (aa) {a,a™} = aa" + (aa")’ (Al)
26
2. Elements of the Gaussian formalism
a. Bases for CV systems

The choice of basis does not affect operators in the Hilbert space, but it determines matrix representations in the
phase space. We often make use of two common bases for CV systems. The real basis is represented by the vector of
position and momentum (quadrature) operators,

#:= (#1,8n)+--:PiBn)™- (A2)
The complex basis is represented by the vector of creation and annihilation operators,
@ = (t1,...,4m,44,...,a4)7. (A3)

We use symbol + or = in expressions when the RHS is a matrix representation of the LHS given in the real basis
(A2) or the complex basis (A3), respectively.
Both basis operator vectors satisfy the canonical commutation relation (CCR),

[*,#7] = [aa] =i2,, where % Bs C, , & 9 (, ‘ (A4)

j=l

is the (2n x 2n) symplectic form™ and I here denotes the (n x n) identity matrix.

Phase space objects that appear in Gaussian CV theory transform differently under a change of basis as demon-
strated in Table I according to their tensor type. (1, 1)—tensors, such as a symplectic matrix V, transform by similarity,
while (0, 2)-tensors, such as a Hamiltonian matrix H, and (2,0)-tensors, such as the covariance matrix o of a quantum
state, transform by congruence. All (2,0)-tensors and (0,2)-tensors can contract into (1,1)-tensors. For example,
QH and oQ~! are (1,1)-tensors. As a consequence, QHQ is a (2,0)-tensor and transforms identically to o.

Any (1,1)-tensor A expressed in terms of (n x n) real blocks as A = i 2) in the permuted (“xp-ordered” )

A (2,0)-tensor or (0, 2)-tensor, such as 2, requires a subsequent “left-right mirroring”, achieved by right-multiplying
with X ® In.

b. Second-order Hamiltonians

Recall that a Gaussian CV system of n bosonic modes is described by a second order Hamiltonian Has given in
Eq.(3), where additive constants are ignored as they amount to unobservable global phases in the dynamics. Using
Eq.(A5), we express the Hamiltonian matrix H in the complex basis in terms of two (n x nm) blocks!? F and G as

afG F

where we require that G = GT, and F = Ft because H is symmetric in the real basis.
For purely quadratic Hy, Hp, Hc, the relation life, ic] = iaeT (9(-0Hp, -Hc])F leads to the equivalence

iH, =[iHp,iHc] — -—QH4 =[-QHp,—-OHc]. (A7)

This allows us to prove Proposition 1 on passive purely quadratic observables.

11 Tt is common in the literature (e.g. [31, 32]) to consider the commutation relation [a, a] instead, leading to the mirrored symplectic

form Qy fj (; 9 ) in the complex basis.

12 In the main text, we use HP instead of F and H®? instead of G.
27

Proposition 1. For any purely quadratic observable Q = Dab QjxP jf, where Q = Q™ is symmetric, the following
statements are equivalent:

(1) e@> isa passive symplectic Gaussian unitary for all s € R;
(2) e~22¢ is orthogonal symplectic for all s € R;
(3) Q commutes with the free Hamiltonian;

(4) Q commutes with Q;
(5) the vacuum state is an eigenvector of Q.

Proof. (1) = (3). (Q, Htrec] = 0 implies [el Hizee| = 0 for all s € R. Conversely, by differentiating [ei@s, Hirec] =0
with respect to s and setting s = 0, we get [Q, Hrree] = 0.

(3) = (4). This follows directly from Eq.(A7) with Ha = 0, Hp = Hfree and Ho = Q.

(4) = (2). Matrix e~°®* is the symplectic matrix associated with operator eis, for all s € R. Note tha
(e-2@8)* = e228, Then, e~ 22s (e- 2s)? =I for all s € R if and only if [(Q,Q] =0.

(3) > (5) and (5) > (2). The vacuum state is a non-degenerate eigenstate of Hire. Hence, if Q commutes with
Hine, it is also an eigenstate of Q. Conversely, if the vacuum state is an eigenstate of Q, then e~ 22s (e-8@s)" =
in order to preserve its covariance matrix.

c. Gaussian unitaries
2 . - damage
A purely quadratic Hamiltonian H generates a symplectic Gaussian unitary $ = e? = 28 M§ which acts on the
basis € as S'ES = SE, where the symplectic matrix S associated with operator $ is

saema(l ). (A8)
ve ou"

for (n x n) blocks U,V satisfying UUt — VVt = I and UV" — VU" = 0, in order to ensure that the transformed
basis sé satisfies the CCR in Eq.(A4). Passive symplectic Gaussian unitaries do not mix creation and annihilation
operators, so their associated symplectic matrices simplify to S = U @ U*, where U is now a (n x n) unitary.

The real symplectic group Sp(2n,R) is connected, but not compact, so not all elements can be expressed as a
single exponential § = e~°". Instead, every S$ € Sp(2n,R) admits a singular value decomposition [78, 79] in terms
of compact and non-compact symplectic transformations,

sZo! a (" o ) otZo (err son of, (A9)
evr

. sinhr coshr
jel

where O,O! € Sp(2n,R) M O(2n) and r = diag(ri,...,7n) € R”. Phase-shifters and beam-splitters generate the
maximal compact subgroup Sp(2n,R)M O(2n) & U(n) [106]. Together with the 1-mode squeezer, they generate the
entire symplectic group Sp(2n,R) [107].

Finally, recall that every Gaussian unitary can be brought into the standard form U = DeS for some Weyl
displacement operator De, up to an unobservable global phase.

d. Gaussian states

The set of Gaussian states is the collection of thermal and ground states of positive semi-definite second-order
Hamiltonians. They are fully characterized by the first two statistical moments, as given in Eq.(6). The covariance

matrix takes the form
afGF
= ; Al0
28

for (n x n) blocks G = GT, and F = Ft given by

Fyn = (aj + AAj)p — 2(0;)p(Gj)p, Gj = (Gj + Anas) 9 — 2(Gy) (Ax), (All)
where ((-)), := tr[(-)A]. The covariance matrix o satisfies the uncertainty relation ¢ + i2 > 0 in the real basis !%,
and its symplectic eigenvalues are the ordinary eigenvalues of |{Qo|. The uncertainty relation is equivalent to the

symplectic eigenvalues being greater than 1, ie. |{Qo|? > I, giving the relation
-e0EQ —1 20; (A12)
with equality if and only if o is the covariance matrix of a pure state, i.e. all symplectic eigenvalues are 1.
Three notable 1-mode states that we use throughout our discussion are the thermal state pin(m) of the free
Hamiltonian in Eq.(14) with 7 := (e? — 1)~!, the coherent state |a) -= Da |0) and the squeezed state |r) == Visq |0).
Their decompositions [108, 109] in the eigenbasis of the number operator @'a@ ue on {|k) : k € N} are

3. Engineering second-order Hamiltonians with negative energies

We address the question of applicability of U(1) representations with negative charges in the context of quantum
thermodynamics, where physical Hamiltonians have positive frequencies.
We can engineer negative frequencies via modulation [71, 72]. Consider a pair of harmonic oscillators with fre-
quencies w, + 6 > 0, where w. > 0 is called the carrier frequency and 6 > 0 is called the detuning from the carrier
frequency. The total Hamiltonian is

A(t) = (we + dala + (we — O) ahaa + FHA i (e™talal - e™layan) , (Ald)

a
1
>

ees
2
S

where f(t) is a time-dependent real function. In the rotating frame defined by the free Hamiltonian w,(@} a
H(t) is transformed to

Ao + f(t)Him = balay — dahag + f(t)i (ala } — aaz) (A15)

which corresponds to two harmonic oscillators with frequencies +d. Since the interaction Hamiltonian f (¢) Hint

commutes with the intrinsic Hamiltonian Ap, it generates an energy-conserving unitary. More precisely, the overall
realized unitary in the rotating frame is

U(t) = exp(—itflo) exp (—ifin [ ass(s)) , (A16)

Appendix B: Symplectic symmetry representations

The central objects in the theory of asymmetry are operators that remain invariant under the action of a symmetry
representation U and the operations that are covariant with the action of U.

Definition 16. Let G be a symmetry group with unitary representation {Ua(g) : :g € G} in Hilbert space Ha.
We call an operator Vv: Ha > Ha invariant under representation Ua if

IV, U4 (g)] =0, for all g eG. (B1)

Let {Up(g) : 9 € G} be a unitary representation of G in Hilbert space Hg.
We call a quantum channel € : B(H4) > B(He) covariant under the input/output representations U4,Ug if

& (Ga(9)(NOK)) = Ua( gE( )Op( g)', for alg eG. (B2)

We may write G-invariant/G-covariant if the group representations are clear from context, or, simply invari-
ant/covariant if the group is also clear from context.

13 Tn our complex basis, the uncertainty relation looks like (o + i2)(I @ X) > 0 for Pauli X.
29
1. Squeezed passive representations in phase space

A general Gaussian transformation with non-zero displacement U= DeS transforms the basis é as
UteU = SE-E. (B3)

Therefore, every Gaussian representation g + U(g) = De(a)S(9) in the Hilbert space corresponds to a semi-direct
product in the phase space,

S(g291) = S(g2)S(g1) and = & (92.91) = S(g2)€(g1) + €(g2), for all gi,go EG. (B4)

When interested in symplectic representations, i.e. representations with €(g) = 0 for all g € G.

Recall that every symplectic representation that admits an invariant state is a squeezed passive representation
g + S(g) = RU(g) ® U(g)*)R7! due to Proposition 3 which is equivalent to a passive representation up to a
symplectic matrix R. We thus focus on passive representations.

Every passive representation g ++ $(g) in the Hilbert space induces a unitary representation in the phase space via

g > S(g) £U(g) @U(g)", (B5)

where U(g) is unitary, for all g € G. In order to make the unitarity of the passive representation apparent, we work
in the complex basis using the block form of Eq.(B5). To unify notation for this discussion, consider the (1, 1)-tensor

afF G
vet Bi
(é. 4) is)

which may, for instance, represent a symplectic matrix V, a Hamiltonian matrix V = QH, or a covariance matrix
V =o00°"!. Hence, blocks F,G may need to satisfy additional constraints imposed by the represented tensor, e.g.
VOVT =0, H= HT ora =o".

Using the transformation rule for (1,1)—tensors listed in Table I, we find that block F' transforms by similarity,
F + U(g)FU(g)', while G transforms by congruency, G —> U(g)GU(g)",

(:. a). (vo 0 )(é °) G 0 ) =( UQFULa)' | miner a
Gt FE 0 U(g)t} \G* Ft] \ 0 U(g)* (U(g)GU(g)")” (U(g)FU()t)"]

for all g € G. Therefore, a (1,1)-tensor V is invariant if and only if, for all g € G,

U(g)FU(g)t

=F, (B8)
U(g)GU(g)" =G.

Importantly, had we chosen a (2, 0)—tensor e Oo instead, such as QHQ. or o, we would have arrived at the same

invariance conditions in Eq.(B8) for F and G, because a (2,0)-tensor transforms by congruence rather than similarity.

Invariance of transposed (1,1)—tensors and inverse (2,0)—tensors

It is clear that if a (1,1)-tensor V is invariant under a squeezed passive representation, then V~? is also invariant.
However, it is less clear whether V7 is invariant. If V corresponds to symplectic Gaussian unitary V, then VT =
QTV-1Q, with the transposes taken in the real basis, corresponds to symplectic Gaussian unitary

V= exp(—it Hire) vo exp (i< Aree) (B9)

In general, if V respects a passive representation of symmetry g ++ O(g), V' also respects the symmetry, i.e.
[V, O(g)] = 0 for all g € G implies [VT,O(g)] = 0 for all g € G. However, this is not generally true for squeezed
passive representations. In fact, [V,S(g)] = 0 for all g € G implies that [V7,S’(g)] = 0 for all g € G, where
gt S'(g) = 27 S(g)Q is an equivalent, but, in general, different representation of symmetry. We provide a condition
that guarantees invariance of VT under squeezed passive representations.
30

Proposition 17. Consider a group G with squeezed passive representation g ++ S(g) = RO(g)R~1, where R is a
symplectic matrix and g ++ O(g) is a passive representation. Denote by C = comm{O(g) : g € G} the commutant
of the passive representation and suppose that R™R is in the normalizer of C, i.e. (R™R)C(R™R)~1 =C. Then, a
(1,1)-tensor V is invariant only if V7 is also invariant under S.

Proof. V is invariant under S, i.e. [V, RO(g)R~*] = 0, or, equivalently,
O(g)(R-VR) = (R-*VR)O(9), (B10)

for all g € G, which implies that R-'VR € C. Assuming that R™R normalizes the commutant C, we also have
R'VR-? =(R'™R)(R-'VR)(R'R) 1 EC. (B11)

Therefore, O(g)(R'VR-T) = (R™VR~-7T)O(g) for all g € G, which implies, by taking the transpose, that
O(g)"(R“VTR) = (R-'VTR)O(g)" , (B12)

for all g € G. Since g ++ O(q) is an orthogonal representation, we have O(g)? = O(g7') for all g € G, so, by replacing
g~' with g in Eq.(B12), we obtain

O(g)(R-'VTR) = (R-'VTR)O(g), (B13)

for all g € G, which is equivalent to [V", RO(g)R~'] = 0 for all g € G, ie. V7 is invariant under 9.

The statement of Proposition 17 holds also for a (2,0)-tensor V and its inverse V~! instead of its transpose. The
assumption of Proposition 17 is trivially satisfied when R™R € C, for example when R = I. On the contrary, consider
R= Visq(r) for some r # 0 and a passive representation g ++ O(@) of U(1) symmetry on 1 mode (see Fig. 2), so that
6++ RO(6)R7! admits RR™ as an invariant covariance matrix, corresponding to some squeezing parameter r. Due
to Eq.(44), the relevant commutant is C = {mexp(@Q) :m € R,6 € [0,27)}, so RR = Visq(2r) does not normalize
C. As a consequence, the squeezed state with opposite squeezing —r is not invariant because its covariance matrix is
the inverse (RR™)~1.

where I, ® Z maps #; + #; and p; + —p; for all j in the real basis, and X, Z are the qubit Pauli operators.

2. Invariance in phase space

The transformation rules in Table I determine the invariance conditions under symplectic representations.

Proposition 18. Let G be a symmetry group with symplectic Gaussian representation g ++ S(g) in Hilbert space H,
and associated representation g ++ S(g) in phase space. Then,

(i) a second-order Hamiltonian H= i DLE" HED, is invariant if and only if
S(QE=E, and S(g)\QHOS(g)" = OHO, for allg EG, (B15)
(ii) a Gaussian state p € B(H) is invariant if and only if its displacement vector d and covariance matrix 0 satisfy
S(gd=d, and S(g)oS(g)" =o, for allg EG, (B16)
(iii) a Gaussian unitary 0 = DeV : BCH) > B(H) is invariant if and only if

S(gJ€=E, and S(g)VS(g)'=V, for allg EG. (B17)
31

Let G have squeezed passive representations g ++ Sa(g) and g> Sp(g) in input and output Hilbert spaces Ha, Hp,
with associated representations g++ S'4(g) and g++ S'p(qg) in phase space. Then,

(iv) a Gaussian channel E : BH) > B(Hp) with phase space action as given in Eq.(7) is covariant if and only if
Sa(gé=E, XSa(g)=Sp(g)X, and Sp(g)¥Spa(g)’ =Y, for allg eG. (B18)

Proof. First, note that a displacement operator De is invariant under a representation g ++ S(g) if and only if vector
€ is invariant, because S(g)DeS(g)t = Dsayes for allg € G.
Statement (i) follows directly from $(g)tH$(g) = Dh ek Sg) THS(Q)EDs qe: for all g € G and the transfor-
mation rule for H listed in Table I.
Statement (ii) follows directly from the fact that Gaussian state is uniquely specified by its displacement vector
d and covariance matrix o and the transformation rules for d,¢ listed in Table I.
The direct part of statement (iii), ie. the part where we assume that U is invariant, follows immediately from

the transformation rule for V listed in Table I. The converse needs care, since, in general, a symplectic matrix V
ih ¢

corresponds to a symplectic Gaussian unitary V=e ‘H2 that cannot be expressed as a single exponential due
to the non-compactness of the real symplectic group. Consider the singular value decomposition in Eq.(A9), which
can be re-expressed as V = OVV'V for an orthogonal symplectic O and positive-definite symplectic VVTV. First,
note that we can write VVTV in terms of an exponential, ie. /VTV = e~®”, because, by Eq.(A9), V7V 2
O (O74 diag (e?" ees ) O7, and taking the square root gives

VVTV =exp| O A diag (rj, 173) ] OT] =e", (B19)
j=l

for H =O (Oi Qdiag (rj, -rj)) OT = H™ where we used that O is orthogonal symplectic so 0,0 = OOQn.

Next, consider the case when the representation S' is passive. Then, according to Proposition 17, V™ is invariant,
and as a consequence VV TV and O are also invariant. Therefore, we can write O = e SiH and Vv VIV =e 2, for
some invariant H,, H2. Then, ih, He are both invariant under g > S(g), and so is V = eet,

If the representation g + S(g) = RO(g)R™! is squeezed passive for a symplectic Gaussian unitary R and passive
representation g ++ O(g), then R~!VR is invariant under g ++ O(g), so there exist RIAR and RAR that are
invariant under g > O(g) such that R'VR = exp(iR' ih R) exp(ift AR) is also invariant. Therefore, H,, Hy and
V =e e'M2 are invariant under go S(g).

Statement (iv) in the case of equal input/output dimensions follows directly from the fact that Gaussian channel
Eis uniquely specified by €, X,Y and their transformation rules listed in Table I. The assumption of squeezed passive
representation guarantees, due to Proposition 3, that the representations admit invariant states, which is relevant in
the direct part, i.e. when the channel is assumed covariant.

To prove statement (iv) in the general case where input and output dimensions may not be equal, let p be a
Gaussian quantum state with displacement vector d and covariance matrix o. Consider the action of group element
g € G followed by the channel,

d 4, ga(g)d & XSa(g)d + € = di, and

. (B20)
o 4, Sa(g)oS.a(g)? = XSa(g)oSa(g)™XT+Y = 04.
Now consider the action of the channel followed by group element g € G,
a =; xd + ¢ 52, g9(g)Xd+ Sp(g)é =: d,, and
(B21)

o 5 XoXT+Y EU), Sp(g)XoX7Sp(g)? + Sa(g)¥Sa(g)t = 05.

Assume that € is covariant according to Definition 16. Then, we must have d, = dy for arbitrary initial d, leading to
the conditions Sg(g)€ = € and XS4(g) = Se(g)X. We must also have o{ = 04 for arbitrary initial 7, which leads to
the condition Sg(g)Y Sp(g)t =Y.

Conversely, assume that the conditions in Eq.(B18) hold. Then, di = dj and o{ = o4 for an arbitrary initia
quantum state with displacement vector d and covariance matrix 7, so the Gaussian quantum channel € is covariant
according to Definition 16.

32

It is clear that if either Hamiltonian H or state p = e!9F /tr[e'?#] at any temperature 8~! > 0 is invariant, then
the other one is as well. Moreover, if any one of the (1,1)-tensors, QH or ¢Q~! = icoth (ZiQH) is invariant, then
the other one is as well. As a corollary of Proposition 18, proving one of the above invariances either in phase space
or in Hilbert space, guarantees the rest.

3. Irrep decomposition of squeezed passive representations

Let G be a symmetry group with representation U(g) for all g € G in Hilbert space H = L?(R") of a bosonic
system. Under the action of a representation of G, the Hilbert space admits a decomposition of the form

12(R") & D CH @ My, (B22)
Xd

where there may be arbitrarily many inequivalent irreps \, while C% and M) can be finite or infinite dimensional
subspaces. To characterize the asymmetry of general systems, we would need to understand the asymmetry in all
these, potentially infinite, irreps.

However, the CV systems under consideration are described by a finite number n of modes in phase space. A passive
operator U has an associated symplectic matrix S 4 U © U* according to Eq.(B5). Since passive representations
do not mix creation and annihilation operators, the phase space decomposes identically within the block of creation
operators and within the block of annihilation operators. Therefore, we introduce a decomposition of symmetry in
the linear span of annihilation operators, which is isomorphic to C”,

ceQMc*emM=2@c*ec™, (B23)
AEA AEA

where A is the set of inequivalent irreps, C% is the d,—dimensional invariant subspace of irrep \, and My, is the
subspace associated with all m(A) multiplicities of A. According to this decomposition, by a proper change of basis,
U(g) decomposes in irreps as

Ug) =QUag) @Inay, for allg EG. (B24)
AEA

Consider a (1,0)-tensor d * a@a* in phase space. Invariance under representation S =U @ U* means that a =
U(g)q@ for all g € G. This occurs if and only if a contains non-zero components within the trivial subrepresentation
Atrivial, Which is a 1-dimensional irrep. Therefore, @ is invariant if and only if

= OD Aint (B25)

where Q),,,,;4; 18 an arbitrary complex vector of m(Atrivial) components in the multiplicity space of Atrivial, and O is
the zero vector of n — m(Atrivial) in the compliment space A \ {Atrivia}-

In order to fully characterize invariance of larger phase space tensors under passive representations, we need to
introduce the notion of a dual irrep. For any irrep \ € A, its dual A* € A* == {y* : yp © A} is defined such that irrep
U)» is equivalent to UX, ie. there exists a matrix By such that

Uy: (9)* = By"Uy(9) By , (B26)

for all g € G. Dual irreps have equal dimensions, d,» = dy, so there exists a bijection between the bases of their
corresponding invariant subspaces, but the corresponding multiplicity spaces are unconstrained. Since U)(g),U)«(g)
are unitary, B) can in general be chosen to be a multiple of a unitary matrix [80].

We can provide a classification of irreps in terms of their duals:

(1) Inrep A € Ais called self-dual if \* © ), i.e. there exists an invertible matrix By such that U¥(g) = By'Uy(g)By
or all g € G. One can check using Schur’s lemma that, for self-dual A, By is either symmetric or anti-symmetric,
and, additionally, if By is symmetric, then U) is equivalent to an irrep with real matrix elements [80, 110}.

f By is symmetric, the self-dual irrep X is called real. We denote the set of real irreps by Ayeal. Any symmetry
hat is reducible over the reals has real irreps, i.e. UX(g) = U)(g) for all g € G, with the permutation group
S, serving as an example. The adjoint representation of a simple compact Lie group is also always a real
irrep [80, 81].
f By is anti-symmetric, the self-dual irrep \ is called pseudo-real. We denote the set of pseudo-real irreps by
Apseu. A prominent example of a pseudo-real irrep is SU(2) with total angular momentum 1/2 in which case
UX(g) = YU (g)Y for all g € G, where Pauli matrix Y is anti-symmetric.

33

(2) Irrep A € A is called complex if \* # X. It is then relevant whether its inequivalent dual irrep \* belongs to the
set of inequivalent irreps A. We denote the irreps with no dual in A, and the irreps with an inequivalent dual
pair, respectively, as

Angi=A\A*, — Apa = (AMA*) \ (Areat LI Apseu) - (B27)

The U(1) symmetry is an important example of a symmetry with complex irreps. Specifically, A contains
inequivalent dual irreps of U(1) if the representation of U(1) is generated by a charge operator that contains
charges of equal magnitude but opposite signs. Additionally, the defining representation of SU(3) is a complex
irrep, i.e. is not equivalent to its complex conjugate.

According to this characterization, the set of inequivalent irreps naturally partitions in four disjoint subsets,
A = Ang U Azeat LU Apseu LI Apa - (B28)

Let us now consider an invariant (1,1)-tensor represented by blocks F,G according to Eq.(B6). Our goal is to
decompose F and G into the irreps induced by representation U. Recall that (2,0)-tensors and (0, 2)-tensors can be
converted into (1, 1)-tensor by appropriate contractions with the symplectic form.

The invariance condition for component F as given in Eq.(B7) is F = U(g)FU(g)'. Denoting by Fy’ the component
of F that maps irrep ’ to irrep A, Schur’s lemma requires that

Fyy « Lay" 5 (B29)

for all \,’ € A. This decomposition is independent of the nature of the dual irrep A*. Accounting for multiplicities,
F takes the following explicit form,

F= Ql, @Pr= YO ProarlA.8,ay(r,8,0'| , (B30)
AEA ACA
8,01,
where index s = 1,...,d) labels a basis for irrep A of dimension d, and indices a,a’ = 1,...,m/(A) label a basis in

the multiplicity space of irrep A of dimension m(A). This fully characterizes an invariant (1, 1)-tensor in the case of
G = 0, which may correspond to absence of squeezing in an appropriate context.

The invariance condition for component G as given in Eq.(B7) is G = U(g)GU(g)". Denoting by Gy the
component of G that maps irrep \’ to irrep A, Schur’s lemma requires that

Block By is diagonal, symmetric and unitary for each real irrep A € Areal, and diagonal, anti-symmetric and unitary for
each pseudo-real irrep A € Apseu. For each inequivalent dual pair \,* € Apa, unitary block By = BL. is off-diagonal
with respect to the irrep bases of X and A*. Accounting for multiplicities, G takes the following explicit form,

G= YO Bysei Grea’ |As8,a(d, 8,0) + S> (Bywo0'G@raa’ As 8, A", 8/,0"| + BY, Gre aca! [A 8,a/ (A, 8,0) 5

(B32)
where s,s’=1,..., dy, w=1,...,m(A), and a’ = 1,...,m(A*). Note that for a self-dual irrep A, m(A*) = m(A).
We summarize the above analysis in the following statement, where we provide a full characterization of the irrep
decompositions of blocks F and G under passive representations.

Proposition 19. Let G be a symmetry group with passive representation g + S(g) = U(g) ® U(g)* in phase space.
There exists a basis, called the irrep basis, such that the unitary U(g) decomposes in irreps as

Note that this decomposition can be readily employed when dealing with squeezed passive representations of the
form R(U(g) @U(g)*)R7!, where R is a symplectic matrix that may contain squeezing, as equivalent representations
have the same irrep decomposition up to a basis change by R.

4. Irrep decomposition of invariant Gaussian symplectic Gaussian unitaries and quantum states

Proposition 19 has direct implications on the structure of invariant symplectic and covariance matrices under
a squeezed passive representation g ++ R(U(g) @ U(g)*)R~+ of a symmetry group G, with symplectic R, and in
particular on the entanglement between modes. We focus on passive representation g ++ U(g) ®U(g)* and recall that
the invariant unitaries and states of the squeezed passive representation can be obtained by the invariant states of
the passive representation via a basis transformation by R.

Any symplectic Gaussian unitary S cannot correlate modes carrying irreps of different type among the four types

The symmetry necessitates entanglement between inequivalent dual irreps, and allows for arbitrary entanglement
within multiplicity subspaces, but all other irrep subspaces are uncorrelated with each other.

Consider the decomposition of U(g) in the irrep basis given in Eq.(B33). The displacement vector d £aga*
of invariant state fp is expressed in the irrep basis via Eq.(B34), meaning that it is non-zero only on modes where
G F
EF* G

Eq.(B35), where, in order to satisfy the covariance matrix constraints F = F' and G = GT", we require that

the symmetry acts trivially. The covariance matrix ¢ = of p is expressed in the irrep basis according to

(i) Fy is a (m(A) x m(A)) Hermitian matrix for all \ € A,

(ii) Gy is a (m(A) x m(A)) complex symmetric matrix for all A € Areal,
(iii) Gy is a (m(A) x m(A)) complex anti-symmetric matrix for all A € Apseu ,

5. Examples of passive representation decompositions

For the sake of concreteness, we provide examples of Gaussian operators that are invariant under specific symmetries
of interest. Using Proposition 19, we can also immediately derive invariant tensors in phase space.

Trivial symmetry. In the case of no symmetry, the trivial representation corresponds to A = {Atrivial}, Where
Atrivial is a 1-dimensional, self-dual irrep with multiplicity equal to the number of total modes of the system, m(A) = n.

SU(2) symmetry. Recall the Schwinger representation S(U) : U € SU(2) from Eq.(28). This is a pseudo-real
irrep satisfying U* = QTUQ. An SU(2)-invariant covariance matrix ¢ on 2 modes takes the form

o2{ 9% Ab (B41)
Filz 0

where Jy is the (2 x 2) identity matrix, and F, > 1 is a real number. Recall that in the case of a pseudo-real irrep,
the non-passive block is B, ® G) for an anti-symmetric matrix G). Here, By = 2 and G) is a 1-dimensional anti-
symmetric matrix, so it must equal 0. Hence, the only 2-mode SU(2)-invariant Gaussian states are two uncorrelated
modes at equal temperature. Similarly, one finds that the only 2-mode SU(2)-invariant Gaussian unitary is the
identity operator.

A less trivial example arises when we consider the group SU(2) on 6 modes, with representation

U =U(a,B,7) @Iy. (B42)

Therefore, the 6-mode SU(2)-invariant covariance matrix o takes the form

ot 2@G3 I, @ F3 : (B43)

where F3 > J3 is a (3 x 3) Hermitian matrix and G3 is a (3 x 3) anti-symmetric matrix.
U(1) symmetry. Consider U(1) symmetry on 3 modes, with Tepresentation U(t

S3 and Z; symmetries and composite representations. Consider an interaction Hamiltonian H'?, between

system A with n4 modes and representation g 4 Sa(g) =

Therefore, Aint, is invariant under the symmetry if U4(g)FUp(g)' = F and Ua(g)GUp(g)" = G, for all g € G. These

conditions can be vectorized to

Up(g)* is real, the conditions for F and G are identical.

6. Local decomposition of U(1)—invariant Gaussian unitaries

We prove that U(1)-invariant Gaussian unitaries decompose to 2—local U(1)-invariant Gaussian unitaries.

Proposition 2. All U(1)-invariant Gaussian unitaries are generated by displacement operators on zero-charge sec-
tors, phase-shifters, beam-splitters between sectors of equal charge and 2-mode squeezers between sectors of opposite
charge.

Proof. Recall the general U(1) representation O(@) = @j- el 4 454) with integer charges q; # 0. A Hamiltonian
H= tk (Fix + G jxiijdx) +H. is invariant under O if and only if Fy, = ela —45) Fr, and Gyn = ele tWG,,

so we can decompose any invariant Hamiltonian as

i = SOF; + ST Fx (alan —ayah) + > Gye (alah — ajar) - (B56)
a i kidgk qi=-
j= Ok

The Lie algebra of invariant Hamiltonians is therefore spanned and hence generated by phase-shifters, beam-splitters
between sectors of equal charge and 2—mode squeezers between sectors of opposite charge. According to Proposition 18,
the group of G-invariant symplectic transformations is connected. As a consequence, the Lie group of U(1)-invariant
symplectic matrices is generated by exponentials of multiples of these generators.

As an example, suppose we have two equal charges, i.e. Q = q(I @1). Then, any invariant covariance matrix o as
given by Eq.(44) decomposes as

mI 0

we (rato orrrats( 0 rl

) int er)’,
38

2
for symplectic eigenvalues 11,2 > 1, and parameters @ = tan~1(612), and ¢! = 3 tan71 (#8).

On the other hand, suppose that we have two opposite charges, i.e. Q = q(I @ —I). Then, o decomposes as

I 0 ,
7 = (Vps($) ® 1) Vasq(r) (" J raat en)",
0 wt
for symplectic eigenvalues 11,12 > 1, and parameters ¢ = — tan! (612), and r= -3 tanh! (25):

We highlight that in the case of equal charges, a beam-splitter was used for the decomposition, whereas in the
case of opposite charges, a 2—mode squeezer was used instead. It is natural to ask if there is a systematic way to
decompose U(1)-invariant symplectic matrices on an arbitrary number of modes. If all charges q; = q are equal,
then invariant symplectic matrices coincide with passive symplectic matrices, and there exists a known algorithm [73]
that decomposes them into phase-shifters and beam-splitters. In the context of symmetries, this algorithm hinges
on the fact that the symplectic form 2, is proportional to the charge QQ, = qQn, so the conditions for a matrix
to be symplectic and U(1)-invariant coincide. This reduces the problem into decomposing an (n x n) unitary that
mixes annihilation operators into (2 x 2) unitaries and phases. If at least two charges have different signs, then the
conditions for a matrix to be symplectic and U(1)-invariant no longer coincide, so the algorithm cannot be easily
extended to the general case of U(1) symmetry. We leave the task of finding such an algorithm as an open question.

7. Squeezed passive representations as symplectic representations that admit invariant states

We prove that all symplectic representations that admit an invariant state are equivalent to a passive representation,
and further admit a pure invariant state. As noted in the main text, the first statement on compact groups is an
immediate consequence of the Cartan-Iwasawa-Malcev theorem [75-77]. Here, we present a self-contained proof.

Proposition 3. Let G be a group with a symplectic representation S : G — Sp(2n,R) that admits a G-invariant
quantum state with finite covariance matrix o, i.e. such that S(g)oS(g)? = o for all g € G (this condition is
automatically satisfied if G is compact). Then, the following statements are true.

(i) Representation S' is symplectically equivalent to a passive (orthogonal symplectic) one; that is, there exists a
symplectic matric R € Sp(2n,R) such that, for all g € G,

O(g) = R7'S(g)R € Sp(2n,R) NO(2n). (33)

(ii) The passive representation O is unique up to conjugation by an orthogonal symplectic transformation; that is,
if O(g) = R-1S(g)R is passive for some g € G and symplectic matrix R, then O(g) = TO(g)T™ for some
orthogonal symplectic matrix T.

(iii) Representation S admits a pure Gaussian G-invariant state, which is characterized by zero displacement and
covariance matrix RR? .

Proof. We first prove statements (i) and (iii). Compact groups always admit an invariant quantum state,

o=r / dg S(g)S(9)". (B57)

Indeed, o is symmetric, G-invariant, i.e. S(g)o.$(g)? =o for all g € G, and satisfies the uncertainty relation +i > 0
for sufficiently high r > 0.

In both cases of a compact and non-compact group G, given a covariance matrix o that remains invariant under
the action of symmetry, we can obtain a covariance matrix o.. of a pure state by applying the transformation
Littiby: yeni I= coth(a coth™! (aiQ)) iQ. Here, if o is the covariance matrix of Gaussian state e~°" /tr[e~°"], then og
is the covariance matrix of a Gaussian state with the same Hamiltonian H and temperature (a8)~1. Finally, /oz is
a symplectic transformation as discussed in the proof of Proposition 6. Choosing R = \/a3. completes the proof.

We now prove statement (ii). The symplectic transformation Q = RoR satisfies O(g) = QO(g)Q-!. Consider the
Bloch-Messiah decomposition Q = O2DO, (according to Eq.(A9)), where D is a positive-definite diagonal symplectic
matrix, and O; and Oy are orthogonal symplectic. Define the orthogonal transformation I(g) := O,O(g)O}. Then,

O(g) = (02D01)O(g)(O2D01)~ = O2DI(g)D~10F (B58)
39
is orthogonal if and only if DI(g)D~+ is orthogonal, i.e.
(DI(g)D~*)(DI(g)D“*)* = I, (B59)
or equivalently,
DI(g)D~?I(g)"D=TI, (B60)

where we have used the fact that D is diagonal, and therefore D = D™. This equivalently means that [D~?, I(g)| = 0,
or, since D is positive-definite, [D, I(g)] = 0, for all g € G. Together with Eq.(B58), we get

O(g) = O2DI(g)D~'OF = O2I(g)OF = (0201)O(g)(O201)" , (B61)

where T := O20, is orthogonal and symplectic, concluding the proof.

An important corollary of Proposition 3 is that symplectically equivalent representations have the same irrep
multiplicities.

Proposition 20. Consider two G-invariant symplectic subspaces Fy and Fy with equal dimensions, symplectic forms
Q1 and Q2, and squeezed passive representations S; and Sz, respectively. Suppose there exists a symplectic intertwiner
V:F, > Fy, such that VIQ2V =Q1, and VS;(g) = S2(g)V for allg € G. Then, for each irrep \ of group G in the
associated unitary representation in the space of annihilation (or creation) operators, the multiplicity m(A), as defined
by Eq.(B33), is identical for S; and S>.

Conversely, if all multiplicities m(A) are identical for two symplectic representations S, and Sz, then the represen-
tations are equivalent up to a similarity transformation by a symplectic matrix V, i.e. S2(g) =V~!Si(g)V :g € G.
If S, and Sz are both symplectic and orthogonal, then V can also be chosen to be symplectic and orthogonal.

Proof. Consider the decomposition $;(g) = R1O1(g)R;' for symplectic matrix Ry and orthogonal symplectic repre-
sentation O;(g) : g € G, with decomposition

O1(g) = Vi(g) © Vi(g)*- (B62)

A similar decomposition exists for S9(g), with S2(g) = RgO2(g)Rz!, and Oo(g) = U2(g) @ Ua(g)*.
Since $2(g) = VSi(g)V~! = (VR)Oi(g)(VR)“!, and V is symplectic, the second part of Proposition 3 implies
that there exists an orthogonal symplectic transformation O, such that

O2(g) = 001(9)O" (B63)
for all g € G. Writing this in the complex basis, we find that there exists a unitary transformation U such that
Ua(g) = OUi(g)U" (B64)

for all g € G. This implies that U; and U2 are equivalent unitary representations, and thus have the same isotypic
decomposition,

U2(g) = TU (g)Ut = DUNG) @ Imo), for all g EG. (B65)
AEA

In particular, this means that for each irrep A, the multiplicity m(A) is identical for representations U; and Up.

8. U(1) symmetry breaking for Gaussian systems
In Gaussian systems, U(1) symmetry breaking is equivalent to Z, symmetry breaking for some p > 2.
Proposition 21. Let O(0) = Qj exp (i9qja44;), with integer q; #0 for j =1,...,n, be a representation of U(1)

on n modes. A Gaussian Hamiltonian breaks the U(1) symmetry if and only if it breaks a Z, symmetry for some
integer p > 2maxjez,, |qj|-
40

Proof. Since no mode carries the trivial representation, i.e. qj # 0 for all 7, we can assume that there is no displacement,
otherwise both symmetries are broken.

Any purely quadratic Hamiltonian on n modes takes the form

H= So Fyrahan + Gjrdja, + He. (B66)
j,k=1

For an arbitrary representation of U(1) on n modes, as given by Eq.(20), the subgroup Z, admits subrepresentation

n
O(r) = Qe ruse , forallreZ,. (B67)

j=l

The Hamiltonian transforms under the action of U(1) or Z, as

Arava AlAt — et O(de—ai) ata deta) a a 5
O(0)HO(#)' = 2 lis WW Gan + Gin TY Gay + Hc. , (B68)

where 6 € (0,27) if the symmetry is U(1), and 0 € {r22 Pe Zp} if the symmetry is Z,. Operator Hf breaks the
symmetry if and only if any of the phases e9(4*—4), ¢#(4+45) is non-zero for any permissible 6.
In the case of Z, symmetry with p < max{q;, — qj,q; +}, there may be phases that are zero independently of r.

However, for p > 2max;ez,, |q;|, it is guaranteed that p > qx — qj and p > qj + qk, So H has the same non-zero terms
under the action of both U(1) and Zp.

This result applies to any symplectic Gaussian unitary generated by / any quantum state prepared as the thermal
state of a second-order Hamiltonian that breaks the U(1) symmetry.

9. Mode-coupling and entanglement in the presence of symmetries

We introduce a primitive that entangles systems in a symmetry-respecting manner. Starting with a simple scenario,
let @ and 6 be the annihilation operators on two l-mode systems A and B respectively: Then, passive operations,
such as the beam-splitter cannot create correlations from the vacuum state |0) ?. On the other hand, the 2-mode
squeezer Vasa (1), with r £0, acts on the vacuum as

Vasq(r) |0)°? = sech r §*(—tanhr)! |7) @ |J) . (B69)
j=0

This state is known as the EPR state and it is entangled whenever r 4 0, as its reduced 1-mode states are thermal
states with non-zero von Neumann entropy (Eq.(60)). We generalize the 2-mode squeezer V2sq(7) to obtain an
operator that entangles 2 systems of arbitrary numbers of modes, and we characterize the conditions on the squeezing
correlation matrix r that ensure invariance of the operator under a general passive representation of a symmetry.

Proposition 22. Suppose that A and B are two bosonic systems of n modes, and let G be a symmetry group with
squeezed passive representation g + Sa(g) = R7'Oa(g)R in Hilbert space Ha, where R is a symplectic Gaussian

unitary and Oa has associated phase space representation g ++ Oa(g) = U(g) ® U(g)*.
Define the following symplectic Gaussian unitary,

n
Vaq(r) = R exp S rjwal Bf “ + pli Dr R1, (B70)
jk=1
Al

for any (n x n) complex, invertible matrix r. Then, operator V(r) has associated symplectic matrix

Veq(r) = R}, (B71
sal?) 0 (2 it (cosh mm) 0 )
vrir :
sinh Vrt
a rt 0 0 cosh Vrir
where the basis is (G@1,... Gen dls ae Gt, b, me bas Bh; Me bi).

Moreover, V(r) is invariant under the tensor representation g > S.a(g) @ Sp(qg) if and only if r =Ua(g)rUB(g)™
for allg € G. In particular, if Sp(g) = S49), this condition becomes |r,Ua(g)| = 0 for allg €G.

The correlation matrix r describes how operator Vaq(r) entangles the annihilation (creation) operators on system A
with the annihilation (creation) operators on system B. Operator Vaq(r) is generated by the Hamiltonian matrix
Hyq (1) £r* @r@r* @r and it is an n-mode generalization of the 2-mode squeezer Vasq()s which can be obtained
by setting n = 1 andr eR.

Proof. Throughout the proof, we assume that the representations $4 and $g are passive, which can be achieved by
simply changing the basis by R. .
First, we prove the invariance condition for operator V(r),

n

($.4(g) ® $a(g))Voq(r)(S.a(g) ® S(g))" = exp { Y7 (nix (Sa(g)@}Sa(o)") (Sa(g)b,S2(9)") - He.)

so [S14(g) ® Sz(g), V(r)] = 0 if and only if r = Ua(g)rUg(g)", which holds if Sg(g) = S.a(g) and [r,Ua(g)] = 0, for
allg EG.

Next, we derive the symplectic matrix V.q(r) associated to the operator Vgq(r) given in Eq.(B70). To this end, we
evaluate the operator action on € = (@1,...,4n, al, ah, bi... bn il, wee bi), such that Vag (7) 'EVeq(r) = Vag (rE.

We first derive the action of V(r) on & by considering the singular value decomposition (SVD)

r=U'DW, (B73)

for some unitary matrices U,W and D = diag(\i,...,An), where Ay > 0 for = 1,...,n. The symplectic Gaussian
unitary Veq(r) can be re-expressed as

Vaq(r) = exp (= Ac (a}b} - ain) ; (B74)
é

where the new annihilation operators can be expressed in terms of the original annihilation operators as

ae i= S Uerar ,
x (B75)

=

The modes are locally decoupled in the new basis, so the action of V(r) is independent on each pair of modes,

Vag (r) Ge Vaq(r) = cosh Ay de + sinh Ay bs 3

5 gh oh 2 : (B76)
Vag(1)'beVaq(r) = cosh Ap be + sinh Av a}.

This is the action of a 2—-mode squeezer.
Converting back to the original basis using the transformations in Eq.(B75),

Vaa(r)'@eVeq(r) = D> ([Ut cosh D U],, ax + [Ut sinh DW], OL)

where we have used that (rrt)-2 = (UtDW(UtDW)t)-!/2 = UtD~1U, which implies
UtW = [UtD~ UU DW = (rrt)-?r. (B79)

The associated symplectic matrix Vgq(r) provided in Eq.(B71) can be read directly from Eq.(B77) and Eq.(B78)
up to the basis change induced by R.

Appendix C: Resource theory of Gaussian asymmetry

Here, we provide proofs and derivations for Sections IV and V.

1. Transitivity of free unitaries on free pure states

We prove the existence of a free unitary that converts between any two free pure states in the resource theory of
Gaussian asymmetry and provide an explicit form for it in terms of the states’ statistical moments.
Proposition 6. Let G be a symmetry group with squeezed passive representation g > RO(g)Rt in Hilbert space H,
where O is passive. Let |y1),\W2) € H be any pair of pure invariant Gaussian states, and denote the displacement
vector and covariance matrix of |W) as dk, ok, respectively, fork =1,2.

Then, there exists an invariant Gaussian unitary U, such that U |a1) = |v2). Furthermore, the unitary can be
realized as U = DeV with

€=d2-—d,, and

1 1 43
V = R(R-'02R7")?(R-10,R-*) 2 RI. (18)

Proof. We first consider the passive representation g +> O(g) and make use of the irrep decomposition of an invariant
state |) (see Section B 4) to find an invariant Gaussian unitary V that maps the vacuum state |0)°” to |2).

Let S(g) = U(g) © U(g)* be the associated phase space representation. Let d and o be the displacement vector
and covariance matrix of state |). The displacement operator Dag is invariant as proven in Proposition 18. Due to
Eq.(A9), the covariance matrix of any pure state can be written as ¢o = SST =O (@}- , diag (z? 5925 7°)) OT, where
O is orthogonal symplectic. Then, we construct the matrix

V:=Vo=0{ @ diag (z;,271) | OT, (Cl)

ga
43

which is invariant under S,, symplectic, i.e. Van Jo" =. Then, DaV maps |0)®” to |v).
For squeezed passive representations of the form RS (g)Rt, where Sis passive, we can simply use the transformation

Table I, to deduce that an invariant symplectic matrix that sends R|0)®” to |W) is V = RVR-!oR-TR-!.
Applying first Vj! to send |¢1) to the vacuum, then V2 to send the vacuum to |), we obtain Eq.(43).

2. Interconversion between types of asymmetry

Here we provide the proof of Proposition 7 on the convertibility between type—1 and type-2 asymmetry.

Proposition 7. Covariant channels cannot transform a Gaussian state p with no type-1 asymmetry to a state which
contains type-1 asymmetry, regardless of the type-2 asymmetry of p.

On the contrary, for any pure Gaussian state which contains type-1 asymmetry, there exists a, necessarily non-
Gaussian, covariant channel that maps it to a state which contains type-2 asymmetry.

Proof. As mentioned in the main text, both types of asymmetry remain distinct under Gaussian covariant channels,
ie. the output state contains each type of asymmetry, only if the input state contains it.

Consider a quantum state with zero type-1 asymmetry. In such a case, the state’s first moment is non-zero only
in the trivial irreps of the representation, thus the state respects the Zz symmetry. If a quantum channel acts on the
state increasing its type-1 asymmetry, then the new first moment is non-zero in at least one non-trivial irrep, and the
state no longer respects the Zz symmetry. Therefore, such a channel cannot be G-covariant.

To prove that a pure Gaussian state |) with non-zero type-1 asymmetry can generate type-2 asymmetry via a
G-covariant operation, consider the passive representation g > Ss (g) of a group G on n modes, with associated phase
space representation g +> S(g) 2 U(g) ® U(g)*. Without loss of generality, we assume that it does not contain a
trivial subrepresentation, otherwise we can increase type-2 asymmetry arbitrarily on modes with trivial symmetry.

Firstly, we can convert the covariance matrix o of |) to the identity J by applying the G-invariant symplectic

transformation \/o (see Proposition 6). Therefore, we can write |y) as an n-mode coherent state |i) = |a) =
@j-1 lay), for vector a = (a1,-..,n). We then act on it with the non-Gaussian G-invariant unitary U = I—2|0XO0|.
According to Eqs.(96,97), we can write the output covariance matrix in the complex basis as
G F +
ot (¢ é) ‘ F=1+2(1-)aat, G = 2c(1—c)aa™. (C2)

Whenever the vector a is not invariant under g ++ U(g), the matrix G x aa™ is also not invariant in the sense of

Eq.(B8), ie. Ua 4 a implies UGUT x Ua(Ua)? 4 aa? for any unitary U.

In fact, if @ is arbitrarily high and the symmetry group G is compact, we can output any arbitrary state 7 with
arbitrarily high probability. Define the measure-and-prepare operation €; : B(H) — B(H) that acts on a state p as

E(6) = fay t{planNagl}S(a)eSto)! + tx [a (7 f as fanXaol) | ONO) (C3)

where 7 is a fixed state, and Jay) = S(g) |a) = |U(g)a). Choose f = |a)(a| and label the POVM implicitly defined
in Eq.(C3) as {M, : g € GU {0}}, with g = 0 corresponding to the preparation of the vacuum. Then, the density
function,

1 fag | (ala), g=0,

satisfies p(a|g) 4 p(alg’) for g 4 g’, because the representation acts non-trivially on |a), and it is uniquely maximized
at the identity element g = e. Consider the limit of high ||a||2 which, in the absence of a trivial representation, can
be taken in any direction |a;|. In this limit, and for / = |a)\a|, p decays exponentially in ||a||3 tending to a sharp
distribution around g = e (Dirac delta 5(g — e) if G is continuous or Kronecker delta dy,¢ if G is finite) due to the
approximate orthogonality of coherent states, and channel €; outputs state 7 with arbitrarily high probability. This
holds for any input state with first moment defined by a ¥ 0.

In fact, the maximum likelihood estimator can be chosen [111] to estimate e. Importantly, the density function p
is continuous over the compact parameter space GL! {0}, and identifiable, i.e. g 4 g' implies p(al|g) 4 p(alg’), so the
maximum likelihood estimator converges in probability to the unique maximum g = e for a sequence of input states
with increasingly high |lalll2.

3. First moments of reachable states under Gaussian covariant channels

We provide the proof of Proposition 8 which describes the complete set of first moments of states that are reachable
from a fixed state under Gaussian covariant channels.

Proposition 8. Let G be a group with squeezed passive representations Sa(g) :g © G and S3(g) :g © G on input
system A and output system B with respective sets of inequivalent irreps M4 and Mg in the space of annihilation and
creation operators.

Given any quantum state p with first moment da, there exists a Gaussian channel that is covariant under in-
put/output representations S4,S'g and maps p to a state with first moment dg if and only if

supp (7 (dzdj,)) C supp (7 (dad',)) j (48)

for all uw € (Ma Mp) \ {periviat}, where trivia is the trivial irrep and T“ is defined in Eq.(47).

Proof. First, we note that for a general covariant channel the displacement vector transforms as dg = Xd, + &,
where X satisfies XS'4(g) = Sg(g)X for all g € G, and € is zero in all modes except the mode carrying the trivial
representation. It follows that the projection of dg to the trivial modes is fully unrestricted and can be independent
of the input. Therefore, in the following, we focus on modes carrying non-trivial representations of symmetry and
find the condition for the existence of an invariant X satisfying dg = Xd4+&.

Consider input and output representations

KaSalg)Ka' = QD Up@lmny, KeSa(9)K5'= QB Welw): (C5)

weMa veMp

where K 4, Kp are defined according to Eq.(46), m(j) and m’(v) are the multiplicities of irrep 4 in the input irrep
decomposition and of irrep v in the output irrep decomposition, respectively.
Given a complex matrix X and g € G, we have XS'4(g) = Sp(g)X if and only if X’ = Kg'XKq satisfies

xX’! BU, @Law | = ( Du a) x’, (C6)

HEM, veMp

which leads to the following form for X’ according to Schur’s lemma,

X= @D lu, 2X, (C7)

veEeManMp

for some (m'() x m(y)) matrices X/,.
Defining d!, := Kad, and dz := Kpdp, we now determine the necessary and sufficient condition for existence of
X’ in the form given in Eq.(C7), which satisfies (i) X’d!, = d'g, and (ii) X = Kp X'K;’ is real.
First, note that there exists X’ in the above form satisfying X’d', = d', if and only if for all pp € M4M Mz, there
exists X/, such that
(a, @X1 JM dls = Td’. (C8)

According to Lemma, 23, such X,, exists if and only if
supp (tw, (.d'pq,"11,]) € supp (tx, (U,.d',d/,"11,)) . (C9)
for all p € M4 Mg, or, equivalently,
stip (r# (dzdj,)) € supp (7 (dad',)) , (C10)
for all wp € Ma Mz, where
TWO.) = try, [1K ()K ML]. (cit)

This proves the necessity of the condition in Eq.(48). To prove the sufficiency of this condition, consider a set of
{Xj} satisfying Eq.(C8) for all » € Ma Mz, and consider the corresponding X’ obtained from Eq.(C7). Then,
45

x= KpX'K;! satisfies the desired equation Xd4 = dg. However, in general, this X will not be real. To show tha
X can be chosen to be real, first we note that, because d4 and dg are real, then X*, the complex conjugate of X
also satisfies this equation. Furthermore, because S4 and Sz are real, it also respects the symmetry. It follows tha
3(X + X*) is a G-invariant real matrix satisfying 3(X + X*)d,4 = dg. This proves the necessity and sufficiency of
the condition in Eq.(48).

We prove a standard result for bipartite vectors, needed in the proof of Proposition 8.

Lemma 23. Given bipartite vectors |w) , |W!) € Ha ® Hep, there exists a linear operator Ng acting on Hp such that

(4 @ Np) |) = |w") af and only if

supp (tralle"\(é"[)) C supp (tra lu \sl)) - (c12)
Proof. Arbitrary bipartite vectors |) and |") can be written as |W) = (VM4@Uz) do, |k) ® |k) and |’) =
(/Mi, ® UR) oy |k) @ |k), where My = trplly) (b|] and Mi = tral|y’) (||, and Ug,Us are arbitrary uni-
taries. It follows that there exists an operator Ng acting on Hg such that (I4 ® Ng) |W) = |W’), if and only if
NeUpVMa = Uy /M or, equivalently, Ng := Ui NeUp satisfies VMaNE = /M',. Such Ng exists only i
the support of M’, is contained in M4, which can be seen, e.g. by noting that M/, = VMaNENZV Ma. Conversely,
suppose this condition is satisfied. Then, by defining M;' to be the inverse of M4 on its support and zero in the
orthogonal subspace, we find NE = Ma J/M, satisfies the above equation. This completes the proof.

4. SU(2)-covariant channels

Consider the passive irreducible representation of SU(2) given by
UwH SU) SU eU* =(1en\U eU\TeQ), (C13)

where 2 = - throughout this section. Suppose a channel characterized by its action on the phase space via

Eq.(7), is covariant under input and output representation S. Then, its displacement vector € must be 0 because
representation S does not contain the trivial irrep, while matrices X,Y must satisfy

[X,S(V)]=0, S(U)YSU)* =, (C14)
for all U € SU(2). The conditions in Eq.(C14) are equivalent to
(l@-Q)X(1@Q),UeU]=0, [(Le-Q)Y(XGI1),U eU] =0, (C15)

for all U € SU(2), where we have used UT = QUOT = —QUi. Expressing X + X1 X2 and Y = Yi % in
X3 X4 Y3 Ya

block form, the conditions in Eq.(C14) are further equivalent to
U0\( xX, XOQ)\fUi 0O\_f xX X22 (C16)

U 0\/VNQ Y%\ful o\)_fMNQ (C17)

Since U is an irrep of SU(2), Schur’s lemma implies that

X1,X4, Yo, Vga I, X2,X3,V1,Ya «OQ, (C18)

where the proportionality constants are any complex numbers provided that Y = YT and that X and Y are of the
form of Eq.(A5) to ensure that they are real in the real basis, i.e.

where a,b € C, and y € R are arbitrary, and x := |a|,x_ := |b|, 6 := — arg(a),@ := arg(b) — arg(a). This form for X
is equivalent to Eq.(52). The channel uncertainty relation Y + i(Q ® 2 — X(Q.@Q)X*) > 0 takes the form

which holds if and only if

y> (es — 1? +22) (ee + 2 +22). (C22)

5. Relative entropy of asymmetry on 1 mode

Consider U(1) symmetry on 1 mode, with representation ¢ ++ Vps(4), and uniform distribution p(¢) = x We can
calculate the relative entropy of asymmetry given in Eq.(59) of a coherent state |a) := Dg |0) as follows,

where (1) follows from the monotone definition in Eq.(59), (2) from the fact that pure states have zero entropy (e.g.
because they have unit symplectic eigenvalues), and from the decomposition of a coherent state |a) in the Fock basis
given in Eq.(A13), (3) from explicit calculation of the integral, and (4) from the definition of the von Neumann entropy
given in Eq.(60). The asymptotic behavior of I',(|a)(a|) corresponds to the well-known Poisson distribution.

The Holevo asymmetry monotone of a 1-mode squeezed state |r) := Visq(r) |0) is

Below, we provide a detailed derivation of step (4) and the asymptotic behavior of T’,(|r)(r|), which is not well-
known, as dephased squeezed states don’t correspond to a known distribution, unlike dephased coherence states that

correspond to the Poisson distribution. The entropy of a dephased squeezed state is

T((r)(rlepR) = cosh?(r) log (cosh? (r)) — sinh? (rr) log (sinh? (r))
"2° log(n) — log 4, (C37)

where (n) = (414, +4@442) = 2sinh?(r). Since |r)(r|gpp can be obtained by 1-mode squeezed states via beam-splitters,

Vosq(r) = Vos (/4) (Vos (20/2) © 1) (Visq(r) © Visq(r)) (Vos (7/2) © Z) "Vis(or/4) , (C38)

we can confirm the sub-additivity of the relative entropy of asymmetry,
Pr\rlppa) =TUrXr| @ |X|) < 2PUryr]), (C39)

where the equality follows for gq, = q2 ensuring that the beam-splitter operations are phase-covariant, and the inequality
follows from Eq.(62) and Eq.(C37).

6. Gaussian asymmetry monotone based on the Petz-Rényi divergence

Consider a state p = e~P# /Zo as the thermal state of second-order Hamiltonian Hat temperature 6—!, where we
denote its displacement vector and covariance matrix by d and o, respectively, and its partition function by

Zq = trle~P"] = \/det[(o + i9)/2]. (C40)

Then, the state p*/tr[f°] with a > 0, ie. the thermal state of Hamiltonian H at temperature (a8)~', has first
moment d and covariance matrix given by

FoiQ = coth(a coth™'(ciQ)), with a, =c. (C41)
For Gaussian states 6, with displacement vector d and covariance matrix o, and /’, with displacement vector d’

and covariance matrix o’, the Petz-Rényi a—divergence, with a € (0,1), has been calculated [93] explicitly in terms
of the moments,

Da(dlla’) = ——~ log Qa(Allf’), where (C42)

If #' = $pS* for some symplectic Gaussian unitary S$, then d’ = Sd and o’ = SoS. Therefore, the exponent in

Eq.(C43) becomes d™ (I — §)™ (oa + Soi-aS?)* (I — S)d, giving the expression of f{!)(A) in Eq.(70).
To obtain the expression of £20) in Eq.(71), first note that Zg,gr = Z, because det[S] = 1 for symplectic S, so

Then, we can calculate

where the first step follows by properties of the determinant, and in the third step we used Eq.(C41) and the well-known
trigonometric formula

(1 ah coth(a coth™* x)) (1 ah coth((1 —a) coth? x))
1+

= coth(a coth7! x) + coth((1 — a) coth7! ) (C46)

which holds whenever || > 1. Inserting Eq.(C45) into Eq.(C43), we can identify the expression of f©)(A) in Eq.(71)
as minus the logarithm of the fraction in front of the exponential in Eq.(C43).

7. Second derivative of Gaussian asymmetry monotone

We derive the expressions for FY 5 BS in Eqs.(77,78), when the group is generated by the family of Gaussian

unitaries S(t) = ci with associated symplectic matrices S(t) = e~°°! for t € R.

We first focus on the first moment va and obtain the zeroth, first, and second derivatives of fp (0) =

Appendix D: Conservation laws in closed Gaussian dynamics
1. Invariant normal mode decomposition in the presence of a passive conserved charge

Here, we prove Theorem 12, an extension of Williamson’s theorem in the presence of conserved charges.

Theorem 12. Let M and Q be (2n x 2n) real symmetric matrices, such that M is positive-definite and [Q,Q] = 0.
Then, there exists a symplectic matriz S that diagonalizes both Q and M by congruence,

SMST=QDyjb, vj, =0, (113)
8QstT=Dah, weR, (114)

j=l
if and only if M and Q satisfy
(QM, QQ] = 0, (115)
where Iz denotes the (2 x 2) identity matrix.

Note that the conditions [QM, QQ] = [Q,Q] = 0 are equivalent to [A7,QQ] = [Q,Q] = 0. The theorem is a corollary
of the following lemma, which is of independent interest.

Lemma 24. Let B be a (2n x 2n) real symmetric positive-definite matrix such that

[B, QnQ] = 0, (D1)
where Q = Bear Qjl2, Ns++++In €R. Let A be defined by

A:= BO,B. (D2)

There exists a (2n x 2n) orthogonal matriz O such that
n
OAOT = @PajM, [(0,QnQ] =0, (D3)
j=l

for real positive a1,...,Qn-

Using this lemma, we now prove Theorem 12 via an argument similar to the proof of the standard Williamson’s
theorem, as presented in Ref. [39].

Proof. (Theorem 12) For clarity, we use 2, to denote symplectic form on n modes.
The direct statement follows because, for any symplectic matrix S,

[2,M,2nQ] = STS~? [0,M,0,Q]S7S~T = ST [O,SMST,O,SQS"] S~T =0. (D4)
To prove the converse, first off, assume that Q = Byes qjlz. Matrix M~1/?
because M is positive-definite. Consider the anti-symmetric matrix

is real symmetric and well-defined

A= M19, M-1/?, (D5)

In Lemma 24, we show that for any matrix M satisfying the assumptions of the lemma, A = M~'/20,,M~1/? can
be block-diagonalized using an orthogonal transformation that commutes with QQ», ie. there exists a (2n x 2n)

orthogonal matrix O such that

n
OAOT = Bvj7", (D6)
j=l
[O;QO0) = 0 (D7)
for some real positive 11,...,U,. Let D:= Oia vjIz. Then, the matrix S := D'/?0M~/? is symplectic, because
n
SO, ST = DV? | Buz, | Do? = On, (Ds)
j=l

where we used Eq.(D6). Furthermore, it brings M to the canonical form in Eq.(113),
n
SMS" =D=Qyjh, (D9)
j=l

and satisfies the invariance condition of Eq.(114). This follows from the fact that O, D, and M all commute with
QQ, = OnQ, which in turn implies $ := D'/?OM~-"/? commutes with 0,Q = QQn, and so

SQS* = SQQnS 107 = QQ,07 = Q, (D10)
where the first identity follows from SQ,ST =Q,, and the second from the fact that S commutes with QQ).

This proves the claim for the special case Q = Dj qjlz. Next, we generalize the result to arbitrary symmetric
Q that commutes with Q,,. Let Q be any (2n x 2n) real symmetric matrix such that [Q,0,,] = 0, or, equivalently,
(QQ, Q] = 0. Using Lemma 24 for the special case of B = Iz, and thus A = 0, we find a (2n x 2n) orthogonal
matrix O such that

02,07 =O, OQQ0T = Pa, (D11)
j=l

which, in particular, implies that O is symplectic.
Then, condition [M,QQ,,] = 0 is equivalent to [M,QQ,,] = 0, where Q := Bj qjlz is block-diagonal and

M :=OMOT". Hence, according to the above argument, there exists a symplectic matrix S such that

SMS" =@Quyh, SQST =Q, (D12)
jel

and choosing S = SO concludes the proof.

The charge operator Q = Dy gata, partitions the modes into sectors of constant charge q in the sense that a
strictly positive purely quadratic Hamiltonian a commuting with Q can be decomposed, due to Theorem 12, as
B= VF eae baba (D13)
qcEig(Q) o

for some frequencies w_,_ > 0 with a multiplicity index a, where each creation operator is expressed in terms of the
original operators {4;} as

gto + at

Bana = 2 Thetft DI) sf (D14)
F:a5=l4\ J:43=—\a\

Biae= do rhetet S32 ojeal (D15)
J:a5=|4| J:93=—\a\

for some constants r

. In particular, of contains terms al when q; and q have the same sign, and terms a; when

q; and q have opposite sign. Therefore, of shifts the charge operator Q by qd,
(2, bh al = io 2 (D16)

so that BF baa stays within the sector of charge q.

Theorem 12 also implies a symmetric decoupling for symplectic matrices. Suppose symplectic matrix V = e#® is
generated by a Hamiltonian matrix H such that the assumption in Eq.(115) holds. Then, there exists a symplectic
matrix S which simultaneously diagonalizes Q by congruence, SQST = Di qjfz and V by similarity,

n
SV St = SHS — Bev, yeR. (D17)

j=l

Proof of Lemma 24

Proof. (Lemma 24) First, we note that since B is symmetric, A is anti-symmetric. For any q > 0, let
Qq= B GQ (D18)
Flal=a

be the restriction of Q,Q to the subspace {j : |q;| = q}. Note that Qg can be written as a polynomial of QQn.
To see this, observe that (QQ,)? = — ar Glo, which implies that the projector Bj:laj\=a In can be expressed as a
polynomial of (QQ,,)?. Then, Qg = Qn Bj:Ja;|=4 Iz can also be expressed as a polynomial of QQ.
Since 2,,Q and A commute and are both anti-symmetric, according to Lemma 25, there exists an orthogonal matrix
O such that

OAOT = a aj, (0,9nQ] =0, (D19)

=|

where a; are not necessarily positive. Then,

(0407) Qa={ QB a) QB ghm=- QB aah. (D20)

Flag\=4a lag l= Flagl=a

Furthermore, since Q, can be expressed as a polynomial of Q,Q = QQn, and O commutes with 0,Q, it also commutes
with Q, which, in turn, implies that OAOTQ, = OAQ,O7.

Hence, the eigenvalues of OAOTQ, = OAQ,O7 are equal to the eigenvalues of AQ,. We conclude that the non-zero
eigenvalues of —AQ, are exactly the multi-set

{ajq; : |aj| =a},

with an additional multiplicity 2 for all elements.

Next, we show that the number of positive and negative eigenvalues of —AQ, are indeed equal to the number of
positive and negative elements of the multi-set

{aj = laj| = a}

with an additional multiplicity 2.
To show this, we note that, by assumption, B commutes with 0,Q, and therefore it also commutes with Q,, which
in turn implies that A := BO,,B satisfies

AQg = BOQ, BQ, = BI.QiB=-Bl @ gh) B. (D21)

J:\qj|=4

Since B is positive, it is symmetric and full-rank. Then, applying Sylvester’s law of inertia, the number of positive
and negative eigenvalues of —AQ, is equal to the number of positive and negative eigenvalues of 2B ela =a In, which
are twice the number of positive and negative elements of multi-set {q; : |qj| = q}.

In summary, by looking at the eigenvalues of —AQ,, we found that the number of positive and negative elements
of multi-set {q; : |qj| = q} is equal to the number of positive and negative elements of multi-set {a;q; : |qj| = q}. This
means that, for all 7 appearing in this sector, either a; are all positive, or there exists an even number of j for which
a; is negative. Furthermore, for exactly half of such j, denoted by S$, qj is positive, and for the other half, denoted
by S_, qj is negative.

Based on this observation, we can construct another orthogonal transformation on which ensures that aj; are
positive. Recall that the projector Dj:ta;l=a Ty can be expressed as a polynomial of (QQ,)?. Since O commutes with
QQ, it also commutes with this projector and therefore it is block-diagonal with respect to subspaces {j : |qj| = q}.
Let O, be the component of O in the subspace {j : |q;| = q}. Then, define

O,=SWAPs| @_ X(3)} 0, = W.0,, (D22)

jES4US_

where X(j) is the Pauli X operator on mode j, and SWAP4, exchanges the modes in $, and S_ (recall that they
have equal size). With this definition, we obtain

W,QyW7 = B qj ® | SWAP, a qj X(9)91X (7) | SWAPS

Figl=q jES{US_
q¢S4US_

where the second equality follows from the fact that X(j)qj%X(j) = —qjM.
Then, the orthogonal transformation O = @a>0 Ou = WO, where W = ©, W, commutes with QQn, Le.

O0Q20* = WOQNOTW" = WEQWT = PwW,Q,W} =D = 22. (D24)
q>0 q>0

Furthermore, it brings A to the form required in Eq.(D19) with positive aj, i.e.

OAO™ = WOAOTWT = W [ Baj% | WT = \ argy iQ, (D25)
j=1 j=l

where 7 is an unspecified permutation. The case of g = 0 corresponds to the standard canonical decomposition of an
anti-symmetric matrix within that subspace.

Lemma 25. Consider a set of real anti-symmetric matrices {A,,..., Ay} that pairwise commute. There exists a real
orthogonal matrix O that simultaneously brings them into canonical form,

rank(Ay)/2
OAj;OT = Ba aj~94 | @ Ogim(A;)—rank(A;) > for all j =1,...,N, (D26)
kot
where {+ia;,:k =1,...,rank(A;)/2} are the eigenvalues of A; and 0, is the (n x n) zero matrix.

Proof. For N = 1, the statement reduces to the regular canonical decomposition of anti-symmetric matrix A;. Con-
sider the case of N = 2. Since A; and Aj commute and are anti-symmetric, matrices A; Az = A2 Ai, A? and A} are
all symmetric and pairwise commute. Therefore, the algebra generated by A1A2, A?, and A} is commutative and
decomposes the vector space V into orthogonal subspaces, V = @,, Vz, such that A; Ao, Az, and A} are constant
over each V;,, and for each distinct pair of subspaces V;., Vy", at least one of Ay Aa, AZ, and A? takes different values
between V; and Vy.

Let II, be the projector to Vz. Since matrices A; Az, AZ, and A} are all symmetric, and Il, lives in the algebra
generated by these matrices, it is also symmetric.

Now since A; and Aj commute with A?, A3, and A; Ao, they also commute with all projectors H,. Then,

Th, Ail, =, A1 = Ail, (D27)

are anti-symmetric and commute with II; AgIIx, for all k.
Since A? is constant over subspace Y;,, the symmetric positive operator —Tl, AT), = at ,1 has a non-negative

eigenvalue ay, ,- Then, the eigenvalues of A;I, are all in the form +ia;,. The fact that II,A;Hy is anti-symmetric
implies that there exists an orthogonal transformation on V, that brings II, AiII, to block-diagonal form

O(T, Ail, )O7 = iar 4Me ® 31, (D28)

where c; € {-1,1}.
Now recall that O(T, A2I;,)OT is also anti-symmetric and restricted to V,. Furthermore,

TI, Ay AgIT;, = bIx , (D29)
for some real number b. This implies that
O(M-AiT,)O7 O(, Aol, JO” = O(T, Ai AgI,)O™ = bk , (D30)
and, consequently,
O(TL, AgI,)OT = bI,O(I, Ail.) 1OT = ibay {I a cj, (D31)

J

where the inverse is defined on the support of II,. This means that the same orthogonal transformation O also brings
Ap to block-diagonal form.

Extending the proof to N > 2 is straightforward and involves first bringing A, to its canonical form in each
subspace as in Eq.(D28), then repeating the step in Eq.(D30) N — 1 times for each matrix A,, j = 2,...,N.

2. Conditions for state interconversion in the presence of a passive conserved charge

Theorem 11. Consider a symmetric matrix

a= YS dh, (104)

q€Big(Q)

such that [Q,Q] = 0, where Iq projects on the sector with charge q, i.e. on modes {j : qj = q}.
Suppose 01,02 are two covariance matrices such that

[o1, 2Q] = [o2,2Q] = 0. (105)

Then, there exists a symplectic transformation S such that SQST = Q and So,S* =p if and only if conditions

tr[(7 OMo)*] = tr[(2OMo)*) , (106)
tr [(o1 (Hy — H-g))*] = tr [(o2(Mq — 1-4))*] (107)

hold for all \q| > 0 and integers k.
Proof. On modes that carry the trivial representation, ic. gq = 0, 01H and goIIo are related by a symplectic
transformation if and only if they have equal symplectic eigenvalues, i.e. Eq.(106) holds. Hence, we now focus on

Eq.(107).
We first prove the necessity of Eq.(107) when |q| > 0. The conditions [M,2,Q] = [Q,Qn] = 0 imply that

[M, Q7] = —[M,2nQQnQ] =0, (D32)

for any matrix M. Considering the decomposition
P= YS PO,+I,), (D33)
qeBig(Q)
we also get [M,I, + Iq] = 0, for all q € Eig(Q). Similarly, SQS7 = Q implies that S commutes with QQ, and
hence with II, + II_,.
We now assume that there exists symplectic matrix S such that SQST = Q and So,ST = a». In particular, this
implies that [S,QQ,,] = 0, leading to
72QOQn = S01 STQQn = S01 QQ, S™ , (D34)

where the second equality follows from the facts that [Q,Qn] = 0 and Q = Q? which imply that [ST,QQ,] = 0.
Right-multiplying Eq.(D34) with Q,, (II, + T_,), we obtain

o2Q(ly + Ug) = SoiQ(, + _4)S*, (D35)
on
On

where in the right-hand side we again used the fact that S commutes with QQ,,, and hence with Q? = —(QQ,,)?,
which in turn implies it commutes with H, + N_,. Equivalently this can be written as

qo2 (II, — Wg) = qSoi (Ty — T1_,)s~* ; (D36)

Hence, 01 (I, — W_,) and o2(II, — II_,) have equal ordinary eigenvalues when q # 0, so Eq.(107) holds for all k.
Now we proceed to show the converse. According to Theorem 12, there exist symplectic matrices $1, $2 such that

n n n
Soast=Dyb, S:0257 =QBib, S1QST = %QSF =Dah, (D37)
j=l j=l j=l
where v;,7; > 0 (in fact vj,7; > 1), and

SympEig(Q) := {q; :1,...,n} = Eig(Q) . (D38)

The fact that the symplectic and ordinary eigenvalues of Q are identical is a consequence of [Q,,Q] = 0 and can be
seen, e.g. using Theorem 12 with M = Iz,. The equations in Eq.(D37) imply that

SiS =D, S,.QAS;' =P. (D39)
j j

Using the fact that II, + II_, can be written as a polynomial of Q? = —(Q0)?, the latter equation implies that

S(Hy +H )S'= QB bh. (D40)

J:\qj|=la|

Consider qoy (II, — I_,) = 01Q(M, + II_,). Sandwiching this between S; and Sy! we obtain

qS101 (My —M_4)S,;* = $1 (o1Q(My + T_g)) Sp = —Si (71 PQQ(Ty + T_,)) Spt (D41)
=- Bui Ba qu | = Ba Vj qj12 (D42)
g Flag l= Figl=q
=ld @ iil (D43)
J:la3|=la]

where in the second line we used Eq.(D39) and in the third line we assumed g 4 0. We conclude that, for |q| > 0,
oi (1, — I) is diagonalizable and its positive and negative eigenvalues are, respectively, {v; : qj = |q|} and {—v; :
q; = —\q|}, with an additional multiplicity of 2, and similarly for o2(II, — II_,). Therefore, the assumption of the
theorem that Eig(o;(IIy — H_,)) = Eig(o2(II, — Il_,)) implies that for |q| > 0,

{45295 = lal} = {7% 2a; = lal} and {—v; : qj; = lq} = {-%) + Gj = —lal}- (D44)
Consider the set of modes {j : q; = q} where the diagonal matrix S,QST = SoQSF takes the value g 4 0. We have
shown that on these modes, $,01$7 and $2025} are diagonal and, up to a possible permutation of modes, have an
identical set of diagonal elements. Therefore, by simply reordering these modes, we can convert $1015 to S2o2S3.
That is, there exists an orthogonal symplectic transformation O = @ yi Og, where O, permutes modes appropriately
within {j : qj = q} and commutes with $,QS7, such that OS;o,STOT = $202S}. This, in turn, implies that the
matrix S := S51OS4 is symplectic, and satisfies gg = Sa,ST and Q = SQS™.

Appendix E: Invariant Gaussian purification

In this section, we provide the proof of Lemma 14, which we split into two parts, first proving the existence of
an invariant Gaussian purification, and then showing that all such purifications are equivalent up to application of a
Gaussian unitary on the ancillary system.
1. A standard form for invariant Gaussian purifications

Here we provide the proof of the invariant Gaussian purification as stated in Lemma 14, which is a slight modification
of the original Gaussian purification by Holevo and Werner [69].
Lemma 26. Consider a system with a finite number of bosonic modes and Hilbert space Ha equipped with symplectic
Gaussian representation S4(g):9 € G of a group G on Ha.

For any Gaussian state pa € B(Ha) which is invariant under Sa, i.e. Sa(g)paSa(g)t = pa for all g € G, there
exists a Gaussian pure state |W) 4q € Ha ® Hq where ancilla A has Hilbert space Hq = Ha and is equipped with

representation Sa(9) = S4(g) :g © G, such that |W) 4q is a purification of pa,
ba = trallh\blaal, (El)

and is invariant, i.e. |) 4% = (Sa(g) @ Sq(g)) |b) aq for all g EG.
Assuming d and o are the displacement vector and covariance matrix of state pa, respectively, then, |yW) can be
chosen to have displacement vector dy = d @0, and covariance matrix given in basis fF =T4 OFq by

o —V-0N0D — I OZ,
1% = ; (E2)

ZaAQV/—Na0o — I ZaoZa
where 0 is the zero vector on A, Za := (I, ® Z), and Q is the symplectic form on A.

Proof. The displacement vector dy is invariant under any choice of Sz provided that d is invariant under S'4.
Regarding the covariance matrix, we first note that oy is a well-defined covariance matrix, for any covariance
matrix o on system A. Write © := —o0QoQ — I, and note that © > 0 according to Ineq.(A12). Then, the square root

of } and its transpose VT = va" are well-defined. Therefore, oy is a well-defined, symmetric matrix.
The Schur complement oy/o of the top left block o > 0 is

apja =-Eno Zin (Zsov5") a} (-v50zZ.) = (ZaQ)o1(ZaQ)™ > 0. (E3)

This implies that oy, > 0 by the Schur complement condition [112], and det[oy] = det[o] det [(ZaQ)o~*(Z4Q)*] = 1.
Moreover, all symplectic eigenvalues of oy are exactly equal to 1, ie. —oy(Q@ Q)ay(Q @ Q) — I = 0, which can
by shown be explicit calculation,

Therefore, oy is the covariance matrix of a pure state and it satisfies the uncertainty relation, ay + i(Q @ Q) > 0.
The invariance of oy under representation g +> S.a(g) ® S4(g) = Sa(g) ® Sa(g) follows directly,

where we have made use of the invariance of o under $4, the fact that S'4(g) is symplectic, and the definition of the
time-reversed representation, Z4S4(g)Za .

In Fig. 5 of the main text, we illustrate a procedure that prepares the purification in Eq.(E2), which we describe
here for the case of a passive representation. As usual, performing a symplectic basis change generalizes the result to
any squeezed passive representation. Assume system A has n modes, and consider the normal mode decomposition
of the covariance matrix of /,

where we have used that /—cQe02 — I = V (VD? -IleVvD2— Iv-}.~

Finally, we apply Z,4 on the second subsystem to restore the symplectic form 2 @ Q, resulting in the purification of
Eq.(E2). We can obtain any other G-invariant purification of by acting on A with a G-invariant Gaussian unitary.

2. Equivalence of Gaussian purifications up to local Gaussian operations

Here, we prove that all G-invariant Gaussian purifications of a G-invariant Gaussian state are equivalent up
to a Gaussian unitary on the environment. In the absence of symmetry constraints, this result has been shown
previously [113]. Since our proof relies on this special case, we include it here.

Lemma 27. Consider a pair of systems A and B with finite numbers of bosonic modes and Hilbert spaces Ha and Hg.
Suppose two pure Gaussian states |) ,|Y2) € Ha ® Hp have the same reduced state on A, i.e. tre{|di)vilag] =

tra[|v2)ve2|4p]. Then, there exists a Gaussian unitary Up acting on B that transforms |1) 4, to |W2) ap, ie
Ibo) 4p = Za @ Us) Ys) ap-

To reach this result, first note that the first moments of |x) 4, are of the form d4 © dx,z, k = 1,2, ensuring that the
restriction on A is the same. Their covariance matrices o,,4p, k = 1,2, are related by 02,48 = (la ® Va)oi,aB(la ®
Vz)? for some symplectic matrix Vg acting on B [39, 113]. Therefore, we can relate the two purifications as follows,

Ib2) ap = La @ Da, y—as.2 VB) It) ap = (La @ Up) 1) ap (EL)
Next, we show how this result extends in the presence of symmetry constraints.

Lemma 28. Consider a pair of systems A and B with finite numbers of bosonic modes, Hilbert spaces Ha and Hp,
and symplectic Gaussian representations of a group G, denoted by Sa(g):9 € G and Sp(g): 9 € G, respectively.

Then, two pure Gaussian states |v) ,|u2) € Ha @ He that are G-invariant, i.e. (Sa(g) ® Sp(g)) \we) = |ee) for
k =1,2 and all g € G, have the same reduced state on A, i.e. tral\yi)vil ag] = trel|y2)(v2| 4p], if and only if there
exists a G-invariant Gaussian unitary Up acting on B that transforms lv1) ap to |W) ap, te.

l2)ap =(4@Up) ida, Ue, Sa(g)] =0 for allg eG. (E12)
Proof. The necessity of the equality of reduced states is obvious. Here, we prove the converse. From Lemma 27 we

know that there exists, a possibly symmetry-breaking, Gaussian unitary Ug acting on B that converts |) to |y2).

In the following, we prove that Ug can be chosen to be G-invariant. |
The overall unitary can be realized via Ug = Da, ,—d,., VB, Where Vz is a purely symplectic Gaussian unitary, and
dx,g is the restriction of the displacement vector d, of state |yW,) on B for k = 1,2. Since both states |71) , |y2) are

Ginvariant, their displacement vectors d;, dz are also G-invariant, which in turn implies that Da, ,—d,., is invariant
under Sg. Without loss of generality, we can thus assume that the displacement vectors of |7;) and |y2) are zero and
proceed to show that the symplectic Gaussian unitary Vp can also be chosen to be G-invariant.

The fact that there exists a symplectic Gaussian unitary Vg such that |q2) 4, = (la ® Va) |1) 4p implies the
existence of a symplectic matrix Vg such that

o2 =(I@Vz)oi(1 @Vz)*. (E13)

With respect to this direct sum decomposition, the covariance matrix can be written as

Ok,BA Ch,B

e
on = (n a)  k=1,2, (E14)

with ox%,84 : A— B mapping from the subspace associated with modes in A to the subspace associated with modes
in B. The invariance of 0; under representation g ++ S4(g) © Sg(g) implies that

Sp(g)or,paSa(g)” =or,Ba, (E15)
for k = 1,2 and all g € G. Then,

Sp(g)VBSp(g) ‘01,84 = Sp(9)VB01,BASA(9)" = SB(9)02,BASA(g)" = 02,BA
= Vpo1,BA, (E16)

for all g € G, where the first and third equalities follow from the invariance of o1,3,4 and 02,84, respectively, as given
in Eq.(E15), while the second and fourth equalities follow from Eq.(E13).
As a consequence, S'3(g)Ve5pe(g)~+ and Vg are equal in the image of 01,2, denoted by Bz, ie. for all g € G,

Sp(g)Vell. = VeSp(g)Il, (E17)

where II, is any, possibly non-symmetric, projector to the image of oj p,, i.e. any matrix satisfying the properties (i)

I? =II., (ii) Id € B, for all d € B, and (iii) U.d = d for all d € B., which, in particular, imply I.o1,84 = 01,B4-
Moreover, left-multiplying both sides of Eq.(E15) with II, we find that

TL. Sp(g)Heo1,845a(g)" = Ue01,8a = 01,8a = Sp(g)Ueoi,paSa(g) (E18)

for all g € G, which implies that, for all g € G,

S-(g) = WeSa(g)Ule = Sa(g)Ie (E19)

or, equivalently, (I — II.)Sp(g)I. = 0. Therefore, the subspace B, is invariant under the action of the symmetry
representation S.(g) :g € G. Defining W. = VgII. and combining Eq.(E19) with Eq.(E17), we get

W.Se(9) = Sp(g)We , (E20)

for all g € G, ie. W. is the intertwiner for representations S.(g) : g € G and Sig(g) : g € G. It also satisfies

WlO_BW. = WV QpVelI. = WE NeMe = Ne. (E21)

While Q, is always an anti-symmetric matrix, it may, in general, vanish or have rank smaller than the dimension
of B.. However, this cannot occur when ox is the covariance matrix of a pure state (note that the assumption of
state purity has not been used up to this point). According to Refs. [39, 113], in this case, the image B, of og, is a
subspace that respects the symplectic structure.

More precisely, the covariance matrices 71 and a2 induce decompositions of the (2ng)-dimensional space B as

B=B.0B,=B, 0B, (E22)
where B, and B, are symplectic subspaces that are symplectically orthogonal, with B, the image of 01,84. With
respect to the decomposition (A ® B.) ® Bu, a1 takes the form

1=410M, (E23)

where w is restricted to subspace A® B, and 1 is restricted to B,. In particular, B, corresponds to the modes that
are correlated with system A for the state |71).

Similarly, BY and Bi, are symplectically orthogonal symplectic subspaces, with B/, being the image of 02,34. With
respect to the decomposition (A ® B/) ® Bi, a2 takes the form

02 =W2 On. (E24)

In the above, we established that the G-invariant symplectic intertwiner W. := Vel maps B, to By, while preserving
the symplectic form. Choosing H, to be the symplectic projector to B., W. = VII. maps 01 to wy, ie.

(Ia © W.)oi(La @ We)" = (La @ Vell )oi (La © Valle)" = (La @ Vel)wi (La ® Vale)" = we. (E25)

We now proceed to show that there exists a full G-invariant symplectic transformation acting on B that maps o1
to 02. Firstly, as shown in Lemma 29, any such intertwiner W, that preserves the symplectic form can be extended
to a full G-invariant symplectic transformation Wg satisfying

Well. =W.=Vell., WE2esWe=2n, WeSa(g)=Sa(g)We  forallgeG. (E26)

Since Wg maps the subspace B, to Bi, it should also map B,, namely the symplectically orthogonal complement
of B., to Bi, namely the symplectically orthogonal complement of B/. Furthermore, with respect to decomposition
(A@ B.) © Bu, 71 is block-diagonal, hence a1 := WaoiWp is also block-diagonal with respect to (A ® BL) © Bi, ie.

Qe

1:= (14 @Wa)oi(la @ Wa)? = 42 OH, (E27)

where 7 is restricted to Bi. Roughly speaking, this means that state a, is equal to the target state 02, when
restricted to the modes in A and modes of B that are correlated with A. It is left to show that there exists a
G-invariant symplectic transformation acting only on B which transforms 7 to v2, hence transforming 6, to 02.

The fact that o; and 2 are covariance matrices of pure states immediately implies that 7 and v2 should also
correspond to covariance matrices of pure states. This can be seen, e.g. by noting that, as covariance matrices of
pure Gaussian states, all symplectic eigenvalues of 4; and a2 are 1. Since 6) = w2 @ 7 is block-diagonal with respect
to decomposition (A @ B!) ® B/,, where subspaces A @ BY, and B’, are symplectic, its symplectic eigenvalues are the
union of the symplectic eigenvalues of w2 and of /, which in turn, implies that all symplectic eigenvalues of 7 should
be 1. Similarly, og = w2 @ v2 with respect to the same decomposition, so all symplectic eigenvalues of /2 should be 1.

Based on this observation and the fact that B/ and Bi, are both G-invariant symplectic subspaces we construct a
G-invariant symplectic transformation that maps 61 to 09.

First, it is useful to apply a change of basis by a symplectic transformation T on B, such that the subspaces TB’,
and TB/, are mutually orthogonal with respect to both the Euclidean inner product and the symplectic form. In
other words, they can be thought of as subspaces corresponding to independent bosonic modes. This transformation
brings the covariance matrices to the form

(a ®T)Ai(IA@T)’ =kKeOku, (la @T)Go(I4 OT) =Ke OR, (E28)

where k,, and «/, are both pure state covariance matrices, and the direct sum on the right-hand sides is with respect
to the orthogonal subspaces A @ TB’, and TB’.
This transformation also brings the representation of symmetry to the form

Se(g) ® Su(g) =TSa(9)T 1:9 EG, (B29)

The covariance matrices ,, and «{, are invariant under the representation Sy. Then, according to part (i) of Propo-
sition 3, the representation S,, is a squeezed passive representation, i.e. it is equivalent to an orthogonal symplectic
representation, up to a similarity transformation by a symplectic matrix.

Since subspace TB’, corresponds to a collection of bosonic modes, we can apply Proposition 6 on subspace T'By,,
which guarantees that there exists a symplectic transformation Ny acting on TB/,, such that (i) it commutes with
S.,(g) for all g € G, and (ii) it maps Ky, to K’,, ie.

NukuN2 = ki,. (E30)

u
60

We extend this to a symplectic transformation on TB by acting with the identity operator on TB!, i.e. we consider

Ng = Trp, ® Nu, (

which clearly commutes with S.(g) ® Su(g) for all g € G, and satisfies

(1a ® Ng) (Ke ® Ku)(Ia ® Ng)” = (Ke @Ki,)- (

E31)

E32)

Returning to the original basis, with respect to decomposition B = B! @ B/,, we obtain the symplectic transformation

Np =T Nel =T (Ire, @ Nu)T, (

which acts on B, is G-invariant, i.e. it commutes with representation Sg(g) : g € G, and transforms G1 to aa, i.e.

(Ia ® Ng) 61 (Ia © Nz)” = (la OT) (Ke OK, (Ia OT *)* = 0. (

where the first equality follows from Eqs.(E32,E33) and the second equality follows from Eq.(E28). Hence,

GHinvariant symplectic transformation [4 @ NgWs acts non-trivially only on B and maps oj to 02, ie.

(Ia © NgWa)oi(La © NeWp)" = 02, (Ei

concluding the proof.

3. Completion of symplectic intertwiner

We now complete the proof of equivalence between invariant Gaussian purifications, by providing a procedure that
completes a symplectic intertwiner, i.e. an intertwiner that preserves the symplectic form, into a full G-invariant

for allg € G and some covariance matriz o. Let Fin, and Fou, be G-invariant symplectic subspaces of equal dimension.

where IIp,, is any projector onto Fin. Then, V can be extended to a global G-invariant symplectic transformation

W € Sp(2n,R), i.e. W satisfies
wow =Q, WS(g) =S(g)W, WIlp,, =V.

Proof. For any symplectic subspace F C R?", the restriction of the symplectic form 2, to F is, by definition,

where F+ denotes the symplectic complement of F, i.e. the set of vectors that are symplectically orthogonal to F,
and satisfies dim(F'+) = 2n — dim(F’). Moreover, there exists a symplectic transformation T (ie. TTQ,T = Q,) such

that the subspaces
A=TF, B=TF',

are mutually orthogonal with respect to both the Euclidean inner product and the symplectic form 2.

(E41)
61

It follows that, relative to the decomposition R?” = A ® B, 2, takes the standard block-diagonal form
Dey = 0® Onna (E42)

where 2a = dim(A) = dim(F). In other words, A and B describe independent bosonic modes.
Under this change of basis, the original representation S(g) : g € G, is transformed to

S(g) =TS(g)T"! :9 EG. (E43)

The assumptions that $(g) leaves F invariant and $(g) is symplectic imply that $(g) also leaves F+ invariant. This,

in turn, implies that S(g) leaves both A and B invariant. Then, the restrictions of S(g) to these subspaces are also
symplectic representations of G, ie. S(g) and can be decomposed as

S(g) = Sa(g) © Sa(g), (B44)

for all g € G, where the direct sum is with respect to the decomposition R?” = A @® B. Furthermore, the assumption
that $(g) admits a G-invariant state implies that these restricted representations also have invariant states. Since A
and B are both symplectic and orthogonal complements, i.e. they correspond to independent bosonic modes, we can
apply part (i) of Proposition 3 to each of them. Thus, there exist symplectic transformations R4 and Rp acting on
A and B, respectively, such that

Oa(g)=RaSa(g)Ra', Ong) = Ro Sp(g) Ra, (E45)
where O4(g) and Og(g) are orthogonal and symplectic for all g € G.
In summary, there exists a symplectic transformation
K:=(Ra@Rp)T, (E46)

such that (i) it maps the subspaces F and F+ to fully independent sets of bosonic modes, and (ii) it transforms the
representation S(g) into an orthogonal symplectic (passive) representation on each subsystem,

KS(g)K~* = O(g) = Oa(g) © On(g),

eet

7)

where the direct sum in both Eq.(E46) and Eq.(E47) is taken with respect to R?” = A@ B.
Since A and B are orthogonal with respect to both Euclidean and symplectic forms, there exists a basis

(11, 72,---;T2a,+++;Tan) where {ri,...,72a} and {roa41,---,T2n} span A and B, respectively, and satisfy
ay ae an .
TyQnT2j = TH-10nT2j-1 = 0, TEQnToj-1 = 0, Ij=1,...,n.

Based on this basis, one can define the complex basis a, as

Toj-1 $172; T2j;-1 — ire
0 q Sega = (E48)

a;=

for j = 1,---,n. Relative to this basis, the subspaces A and B correspond to basis elements {aj,a; = naj: j=
1,...,a}, and {a@;,a% =an4;:j =a+1,...,n}, respectively.
Then, relative to this basis we obtain
KS(g)K~* = O(g) 5 U(g) @U*(9), (E49)
where U(g) is a unitary transformation on C", satisfying
U(g) = Va(g) ® Ung), (E50)
for all g € G, and
Oa(g) = Ualg) ®UValg)", (E51)

where U(g) is a unitary transformation on C%, for all g € G. A similar decomposition yields Og(g) = Ug(g)®Un(g)*,
where Ug(g) is a unitary transformation on C"~%, for all g € G.
62

Further decomposing into irreps of G, we obtain

= DUNG) @ Imac (E52)
AEA

where A is the set of all irreps of G, and m,(A) denotes the multiplicity of irrep A in Ua(q).
In summary, we found

KS(g)K~' = O(9) = Oa(g) @ On(g) = U(g) OU"), (E53)
where U(g) = Ua(g) ®@ Up(g). It follows that the multiplicity of A in U(g) : g € G is
m(A) = ma(A) + mep(A), (E54)

where ma(A) and mg(A) are multiplicities of irrep \ in representations U4 and Ug, respectively.

Recall that the above decomposition and symplectic transformation Kk depend on the original symplectic decompo-
sition R?” = F@F+. In particular, choosing different symplectic decompositions R?” = F@ F*+, will result in different
multiplicities m4(A) and mg(A). However, part (ii) of Proposition 3 guarantees that their sum m(A) = ma(A)+mep(A)
is independent of the decomposition.

Now we apply this to the subspaces Fi, and Fou: given in the statement of the lemma. Let R2” = Ay, ® By and
R2” = Aout ® Bout be the decompositions obtained from symplectic subspaces Fj, and Fout, respectively, such that

KinS(9)Kig' = OA.,(9) ® On. (9) (E55a)
KoutS(g)Kout = OAou (9) B OB. (9) » (E55b)

for all g € G. Then, for all \ € A,
Magy (A) + MB (A) = Mage (A) + M Bou A) (E56)

where m4,,(A) is the multiplicity of irrep \ in Aj,, the subspace obtained from Fi, via Eq.(E41), and ma,,,,(A),
MA (A), MB (A), are defined in a similar fashion.
To construct the extension of G-invariant symplectic intertwiner V to W, we consider the chain of transformations

where W is a symplectic, G-invariant transformation defined below in Eq.(E67). The corresponding representations
are

8(9) 22> Os. (g) © On, (9) © Ogu (9) © On (9) “2 $C), (E58)

To construct WwW, first recall that, by assumption, V : Fin + Fout is a symplectic intertwiner commuting with S(q), i.e.

VS(g)IIn, = $(9)VIx,, » (E59)
which, in turn, implies
VK (Kun SQ) Kn a, = Kot Kou$ (9) Kout) KouV in Ta,, (E60)
or, equivalently,
VO4in(9) = Odo (V (E61)
for all g € G, where
V = KouVKz, (E62)

maps Aj, to Aout, and preserves the symplectic form. That is,

OA (G9) Ay = VO dey (GVA, (E63)
63

where V~! is defined on subspace Aout. Then, again part (ii) of Proposition 3 implies that the orthogonal symplectic
representations O4,, and Ou,,,, are equivalent, up to an orthogonal symplectic transformation, and therefore

MA; (A) = MA (A) (E64)
for all X € A. Combined with Eq.(E56) we find that

MB (A) = MBou (A) 5 (E65)

for all A € A. By Proposition 20, this immediately implies that unitary representations Ug, and Upg,,,, are equivalent
up to conjugation by a unitary, which, in turn implies that orthogonal symplectic representations Og,, and Og,,, are

‘out,

equivalent up to an orthogonal symplectic transformation. That is, there exists an orthogonal symplectic intertwiner
Q: Bin > Bout, such that, for all g € G,

Q0B,. (9) = OB. (9)Q- (E66)
Then, define the symplectic transformation We Sp(2n, R), as
W=VoQ (E67)

where V : Ain > Bin and Q: Aout > Bout. By definition, on subspace Ain, W is equal to Vz ie.

Wila,, = VUa, - (E68)
Furthermore, W is a G-invariant symplectic intertwiner, i.e. for all g € G, it satisfies
W(O.,,(9) ® OB,(9)) = (V ® Q)(Oa,,(9) ® OB (9)) (B69a)
= (Ou (9) © Ob.u(9))(V © Q) (E69b)
= (04g (9) ® OB (9) W - (E69c)
Finally, we go back to the original basis and define the symplectic transformation
W = KiLWKin. (E70)
Then, using Eq.(E62) and Eq.(E70), Eq.(E68) can be rewritten as
KouWK;,'Ta,, = KonrV Kj, Wa, - (E71)
By multiplying from left with K>1 and from right with Kj, this implies
Wil, = VIr,, ; (E72)

i.e. V and W act identically on subspace F;,. Furthermore, using Eq.(E55), we find that the left-hand side of Eq.(E69)
is equal to

W(0a,,(9) ® On,,(9) = WKinS(Q) Kin! = KouW S(9)Kin (E73)
and the right-hand side of Eq.(E69) is equal to

(Oscue(9) ® OB (9))W = Kouw'S(9) Koa W = KourS(g) WK; (E74)

We conclude that the symplectic transformation W is G-invariant, i.e. it satisfies S(g)W = WS(g) for all g € G,
and WIIp,, = VIIp,,. In summary, this map is symplectic, G-invariant and as shown in Eq.(E72), its action on Fin
is equal to the action of V. This completes the proof.

Appendix F: Covariant Gaussian dilation

In this section, we derive the channel dilation as stated in Theorem 15. Our derivation works in both the discrete an
continuous setting, and can be extended to hold in the presence of symmetries. We start our discussion by motivating
a rigorous definition of Gaussian channels (in the absence of symmetries) as completely Gaussianity-preserving CPTP
operations. We then prove that a channel is a (covariant) Gaussian channel if and only if it admits a (covariant)
Gaussian Stinespring dilation. We provide examples of our dilation on 1 mode and in a discrete setting.
64
1. Definition of Gaussian channels

Several recent works [30, 32] introduce Gaussian channels by automatically adopting their Gaussian dilation as a
defining property. We say that a quantum channel € : B(H4) > B(Hg) admits a Gaussian dilation if there exists a
Gaussian state 7g € B(Hg ® Hz), where E is the environment, and a symplectic Gaussian unitary Vape acting on
the composite system ABE, such that

E(6a) = trag [Vane(ba @ tze)Wihpe| , (F1)

for all input states p4 € B(H4). Proposition 31 shows any such dilation immediately implies that € preserves the
Gaussian character of quantum states and acts in phase space via matrices X,Y according to Eq.(7).

A more axiomatic approach [67, 69, 114-116] involves shifting the focus from the Schrédinger to the Heisenberg
picture by defining the dual €1 of a channel € via the implicit relation tr[€()O] = tr[p€(O)]. Then, one can define
Gaussian channels as follows.

Definition 30. A bosonic quantum channel € : B(H4) > B(Hg) is called a Gaussian channel if its dual channel Et
maps displacement operators to displacement operators according to

il
(Da) = Dxva exp (-3a"va + ia"e) : (F2)

for real vector € € R?"®, (2np x 2nq) real matrix X and (2npg x 2ng) real matrix Y, where na and ng are the
numbers of modes in systems A and B respectively.

From this definition, one can directly recover the channel uncertainty relation (Ineq.(8)) and the action of € in
phase space (Eq.(7)) [114, 116]. The phase f(d) = exp(—3d"Yd + id’é) is a Gaussian function of d, so the
characteristic function [117] of output €(p) is Gaussian whenever the characteristic function of input p is Gaussian.
As a consequence, € sends Gaussian states to Gaussian states. In fact, € is completely Gaussianity-preserving, i.e.

for any environment E, (€ ®Zz)(paz) is Gaussian whenever pag is Gaussian, where the phase space action of € @Zp¢
is characterized by vector € @ 0, and matrices X @ J and Y @0 [32].

2. Covariant Gaussian Stinespring dilation

We first show that every covariant Gaussian dilation is a covariant Gaussian channel.

Proposition 31. Consider a pair of systems A and B with a finite number of bosonic modes, and Hilbert spaces
Ha and Hp. Suppose each system is equipped with a symplectic Gaussian representation of a group G that admits
an invariant state, denoted as Sa(g) : g € G, and Sp(g) : g € G, respectively (Recall that such representations are
characterized in Proposition 3).

Let € : Ba) > B(HBp) be a linear map defined by the dilation

E(pa) = trap [Vann (64 @ep)Vi 45] + for all pa € BOA), (F3)

where 7 pp € BHHB@Hg) is a Gaussian state which commutes with representation Sp @Sz and Vapp is a symplectic
Gaussian unitary which commutes with representation $4@Sp@ S5- Then, E is a covariant Gaussian channel under
input/output representations Sa, Sp, ie. E(Sa(g)(-)Sa(g)*) = Sa(g)E(-)Sa(g)t for all g € G.

Furthermore, there exist real matrices X,Y that satisfy

Proof. The dilation defined in Eq.(F3) is a Gaussian quantum channel as a composition of Gaussian quantum channels
according to Definition 30, and it is also covariant in the sense that

(Sapa$h) = teraz [Vann(Sasa5}, ® top Vi nn
= trp [($4 @ Sp @ S5)Vapp(6a ® Ppp V 1 pp(Sa ® Sz @ S5)'|

= Satrap [Vapn(64 @Fon)V1 pn] Sb
= Sp&(pa)Sh- (F4)

The first and last equalities follow from the map definition in Eq.(F3), the second equality follows from the invariance
conditions on Vooe and 7,z, and the third equality follows from properties of the partial trace.

Since € is a Gaussian channel, it is fully characterized by two real matrices X,Y. The dilation condition (i) follows
directly by this equivalent characterization of the channel, the uncertainty relation (ii) follows from the Gaussianity
of the channel, and the invariance conditions (iii) follow from the covariance of the channel according to statement
(iv) in Proposition 18.

We now proceed to prove the converse of Proposition 31, which informally states that every covariant Gaussian
channel € : B(H.4) + B(Hg) admits a covariant dilation. The dilation requires an ancilla of 2ng modes, where ng is
the number of modes in the output system B, prepared in a pure state.

Theorem 15 (Covariant Gaussian dilation). Consider a pair of systems A and B with finite numbers of bosonic
modes and Hilbert spaces Ha and Hg. Suppose each system is equipped with a symplectic Gaussian representation
of a group G that admits an invariant state (as characterized in Proposition 3), denoted by Sa(g) : g € G, and
Sp(g):9 €G, respectively.

For any Gaussian channel € : B(H4) > B(Hp) that is covariant, i.e. €(S.a(g)(-)Sa(g)t) = Sa(g)E()Sa(g)! for
all g € G, there exists a dilation of the form

E() = trap [Vann (() @lMnloe) Vi pp| » (122)

where ancilla B has Hilbert space Hy = Hp equipped with representation Sp Qe S38 (9) :g © G, where the complex
conjugate is Pen in the common eigenbasis of position operators, In) BB is an invariant pure Gaussian state, i.e.

(Sp(g) @ Sz (9)) eB = In) pp for all g € G, and Vapp is a symplectic Gaussian unitary that commutes with
representation $.4(g) ® Sp(g) @ Sp(9):9 €G.
Furthermore, |n) p% can be chosen to be uncorrelated between B and B.

Proof. First, consider an ancillary system with the same number of modes as A, denoted by A. Let |) 44 be an
arbitrary Gaussian pure state on AA such that its reduced state p4 = try [|b)| 44] on A is full rank.
Next, act with channel € on subsystem A, to obtain the state

pa = (E@T)(YMblaa), (F5)

where Z(-) = ia(-)Iq is the identity channel on A. Lemma 14 guarantees that #,,q has a Gaussian purification
|®) sapp € Ha @ Ha ®@ HB@HgZ, (F6)

such that the reduced state on BA is 7,3, ie.

fpa = tapll®) (Plaza; (F7)

where B has, at most, the same number of modes as B.
Moreover, consider the Gaussian state

IY) app = lY)aa @ In) pp € Ha @ Hq @ He @Hg, (F8)

where |7) »% is some pure state. The reduced states of |®) 47,5 and |W) 447% on A are the same, so Lemma 14 states
that there exists a Gaussian unitary V,, on the complement system ABB such that

|®) spp = (is ® Vann) |Y) saBB - (F9)

Finally, define the linear map

F() = trp [Vas(() ® nXnlen)Vi |» (P10)

and observe that
a® “ine) (vXvlaa ® InXnlew) (3 ® Visw)

® Vins) UX saeB (is ® Vass) |

= (E@T)(b\Ylaa); (Fl1)

where all equalities follow from the definitions given earlier. Since the reduced state 4 of state |w) ,z is full-rank,
we conclude the equality of channels € = F. This can be seen, for instance, by noting that for any bounded operator
Ma on system A, there exists a bounded operator Nz on system A such that

Ma = trg [(7 @ Na) lXYlaal - (F12)

Namely, one can choose N= p-V/2MTp-¥/2, where M7 is the transpose of M with respect to an arbitrary orthonormal
basis, e.g. the Fock basis. Therefore, for all bounded operators Ma,

E(Ma) = try [(E © D)(WXl 43) (F@ Nq)] = tra [(F@D)WUlaa) (F@Nq)]=FO), — (FIB)

where the first and third equalities follow from Eq.(F12) and the second equality from Eq.(F11).

Next, we argue that if € is G-covariant, then all the steps in this construction can be chosen to respect the
symmetry. To obtain G-invariant purifications, we choose the symmetry representations on systems A and B to be
the complex conjugate of the representations on A and B, respectively, i.e.

S5=$4, $3=S5, (F14)

where the complex conjugate is defined in the common eigenbasis of position operators. Then, due to Lemma 28,
state |W) ,q can be chosen to be G-invariant, i.e.

(Sa(s) © 4(9)) hax =l)aa» (FIs)

for all g € G, where the reduced state on A is full rank. The G-covariance of € implies that the output state 7, q is
also G-invariant, and therefore, by Lemma 28, it has a G-invariant Gaussian purification |®) , 3,5 satisfying Eq.(F6).
Consider the second purification |W) ,7,,% of the reduced state on A, provided in Eq.(F8). As we saw in Proposi-

ion 3, since both 8 'p and Sp admit G-invariant states, they also admit G-invariant pure Gaussian states |71) gp and
72) BR such that

Selm)p=|n)p > 55 Im)— = Ine) Bs (F16)

for all g € G. Choosing |7) ,— = |m) , © |n2)g thus gives another G-invariant Gaussian purification of |W) 7 _p-

Finally, according to Lemma 28, there exists a symplectic Gaussian unitary Va pp that commutes with the repre-
sentation of symmetry on ABB, i.e. $4@5p @55, and converts one purification to the other, as described in Eq.(F9).
Hence, Eq.(F10) and Eq.(F11) remain valid, so Eq.(F10) provides a dilation of the G-covariant channel €.

Note that we are free to choose any (invariant) full-rank state p to construct the dilation in the proof of Theorem 15.

To construct the dilation, we need to find a symplectic matrix V,,5 such that (Iz ®@V,p,)ow(lqg® Vaiss) =e,

which we first do separately for attenuator and amplifier channels on 1 mode.

Attenuators E24 are characterized by x = cosa and y = (2ng+1) sin? a, where ng is the average number of thermal
excitations. To construct its dilation, we can choose mi = ng for the full-rank state that we define in Eq.(F20), so that
y = cosh(2r) sin? a. Since the sign of x does not affect the definition of the channel, we can also choose a € [0, 7/2).
As a consequence, Q = 2sinh(2r) sina, hence u = v = sinh(2r) sina, t = 0, and

cosh(2r)I — sinh(2r) cosaZ_— sinh(2r) sinaZ 0
sinh(2r)cosaZ — cosh(2r)I 0 sinh(2r) sinaZ
Jo = i (F30)
sinh(2r) sinaZ 0 cosh(2r)I —sinh(2r) cosaZ
0 sinh(2r)sinaZ —sinh(2r) cosaZ cosh(2r)I

Indeed, this covariance matrix a is equivalent to aw, up to the symplectic matrix

Amplifiers E°"P are characterized by x = cosha and y = (2ng + 1) sinh? a, where ng is the average number of

thermal excitations. Similarly, we choose a € [0,7/2) and n = ng, so that y = cosh(2r) sinh? a. As a consequence,
Q = cosh(2r) sinh(2a), hence u = cosh(2r) sinh(2a), v = 0, t = —sinh(2r) sinha, and

cosh(2r) cosh(2a)I sinh(2r)coshaZ cosh(2r) sinh(2a)Z —sinh(2r)sinhal
