Abstract

The search for non-toxic lead-free halide perovskites that can compete with the lead-based
counterparts has led to the emergence of double perovskites as potential candidates. Among many
options, Cs2AgBiBre stands out as one of the most suitable eco-friendly materials for numerous
optoelectronic applications. In this study, quasi-2D Cs2AgBiBre nanosheets (NSs) were prepared
via the low-temperature injection colloidal synthesis and used to fabricate high-performance
photodetectors in a transport-layer-free architecture. The reaction temperature and ligands played
vital roles in the structural purity, shape, and size of the synthesized CszAgBiBro NSs. The
fabricated NSs disclosed lateral sizes of up to 1.4 um and are only a few nanometers thick. The
high-performance photodetectors fabricated using the Cs,AgBiBro NSs yielded a high detectivity
(D) of 1.15 x 10!” Jones, responsivity (R) of 121 mA/W, a notable on/off ratio of 2.39 x 104, and
a fast rise and decay time of 857 and 829 1s, respectively. The device demonstrates remarkable
stability. Basically, it sustains its entire photocurrent after storage in ambient conditions for 80
days. This work showcases a pathway for the colloidal synthesis of quasi-2D Cs2AgBiBre lead-
free double perovskite NSs with suitable properties for high-performance photodetection and other
optoelectronic applications.

1.0 Introduction

The difficulty in managing lead (Pb) toxicity and stability issues in lead halide perovskites has
steered an intense search for stable and lead-free perovskites that can yield comparable properties
to their lead-based counterparts for many optoelectronic applications. The earlier solutions
attempted to directly replace Pb in the APb”*X3 basic composition with a similar divalent cation
such as Sn and Ge. For Sn, the huge number of defects and stability issues arising from the easy
oxidation of Sn** to Sn** under ambient conditions poses a major challenge for their application
in optoelectronic devices "'-7!. On the other hand, a few experimental studies have been reported
for Ge-based perovskites °5!, However, Ge is a rare metal, and its scarcity makes it very expensive
and unattractive for practical applications in photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices !!. Moreover,
it also suffers from stability issues and can easily oxidize from Ge* to Ge** '”!. The emergence of
double perovskites has opened promising options for developing low-cost and environmentally
friendly halide perovskites for photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications. The heterovalent
replacement of two divalent Pb** ions in Pb-based perovskites with one monovalent ion (Na*, Ag*,
Cu’) and one trivalent ion (Bi**, In**, Sb**) forms a diverse class of promising quaternary
A2M*M?*X6 double perovskites. This configuration ensures charge neutrality similar to
conventional lead-based perovskites, structural diversity, and controllable size, shape, and
electronic band properties for a more stable material '*!,

Many Pb-free double perovskites, including Cs2AgInClo "!, NasCuBiBro "°!, and Cs2NaBiClo "4,
have been developed after the first reports of Cs:AgBiBrs bulk crystals in early 2016 "13, Despite
these options, Cs2AgBiBro is still one of the most suitable eco-friendly materials for numerous
optoelectronic applications. The material possesses desirable properties such as long carrier
lifetimes, high chemical, thermal, and ambient stability, relatively lower effective mass of charge
carriers, insignificant toxicity, and high light absorption coefficient !"4!!, beneficial for various
optoelectronic applications. When prepared as confined 2D/quasi-2D structures, they offer the
unique advantage of quantum confinement effects and wide bandgap tunability, which can be
relevant for effective engagement in applications such as photovoltaics, photoelectrochemistry,
and photodetection.

Photodetectors based on 2D/quasi-2D materials are among the most competitive candidates for
efficient and cost-effective device design |'6!. This is because 2D/quasi-2D materials are typically
synthesized in their single-crystalline states and have fewer ionic defects and grain boundaries
when compared to their corresponding 3D polycrystalline films |”, Moreover, when in
confinement, 2D/quasi-2D materials exhibit intense absorbance at specific wavelengths that
permit optical tunability and wavelength-selective photodetection applications. 3D materials of
Cs2AgBiBre double perovskites have exhibited promising photodetection properties '*70,
However, the presence of unavoidable defects and a huge level of grain boundaries in 3D
polycrystalline particles results in large photocurrent hysteresis, reduced photostability and
moisture tolerance, and decreased performance reliability "'” ?!, Meanwhile, 2D Cs2AgBiBro
double perovskites exhibit low intrinsic carrier density and high resistivity in the out-of-plane
direction, which leads to low dark current and consequently high detectivity. This has been
demonstrated in a previous study where 2D Cs2AgBiBro fabricated using the space-confined
technique yields superior photodetection properties over their 3D counterparts |"!°!, Typical 2D

2
perovskites form bound excitons with a higher binding energy when excited, which limits
conductivity (in the out-of-plane direction) and charge transport in photodetection applications 74,
However, quasi-2D perovskites can harness the benefits of both 2D and 3D structures for better
device design and performance, which has been demonstrated in many applications, including
photovoltaic !, supercapacitors 3!, and photodetection °4!. The quantum confinement effects,
high surface-to-volume ratio, high absorption coefficient, and out-of-plane high resistivity make

2D/quasi-2D Cs2AgBiBre attractive for efficient photodetection design for practical applications.

The ball milling approach 5), space-confined fabrication "°!, and colloidal synthesis °°! are among
the techniques that have been engaged for the preparation of confined 2D/quasi-2D nanostructures
of Cs2AgBiBrs. The colloidal synthesis offers a versatile, low-cost approach for preparing high-
quality, quantum-confined single crystals of Cs,AgBiBro. In 2021, Liu et al. developed a low-
temperature injection colloidal technique for the first synthesis of quantum-confined 2D
Cs2AgBiBro double perovskite nanoplatelets ?”). Further work done in 2023 by Dor et al. provides
additional insight into the growth mechanism of the nanoplatelets and proposed self-assembly of
small platelets into larger ones during the crystal formation, which results in some physical defects
81 In both cases, the confined nanoplatelets were prepared at a reaction temperature of 230 °C,
and consisted of platelets with a lateral size of 330 + 230 nm and a thickness of 3.6-6.0 nm. These
studies did not provide a comprehensive report on the role of reaction temperature and ligands in
the growth of colloidal Cs2zAgBiBre nanocrystals. More so, the successful colloidal synthesis of
Cs2AgBiBre nanoplatelets/nanosheets above 230 °C has not been reported based on known
literature. In colloidal synthesis, the reaction temperature and ligands can significantly influence
the size, shape, structural defects, and crystallization of nanomaterials. In the colloidal synthesis
of perovskite nanocrystals, an increase in the concentration of ligands can provide a unique acid-
base equilibrium that could allow their crystallization at a higher temperature, thereby influencing
their size, shape, and structure °°),

In this project, colloidal quasi-2D Cs2AgBiBre nanosheets (NSs) were fabricated using a low-
temperature injection and heat-up process, and the role of reaction temperature and ligands in the
synthesis was systematically investigated. The Cs2AgBiBrs NSs were used to develop high-
performance photodetectors. Quasi-2D Cs2AgBiBreo NSs with a lateral size of up to 1.4 um and
only a few nm thick were fabricated at 250 °C reaction temperature under favorable ligand
conditions, without distorting the material’s crystal structure. The reaction temperature and ligands
served crucial roles in the structural integrity, shape, and size of the synthesized Cs2AgBiBrs. The
high-performance photodetectors show a high detectivity of 1.15 x 10'? Jones, responsivity of 121
mA/W, and fast rise and fall times of 857 and 829 us, respectively. In addition, the device
demonstrated a notably high on/off ratio of 2.39 x 10%. It is worth noting that the Cs,AgBiBre
photodetectors attained such high performance in a charge transport layer-free architecture, which
usually adds to the complexity of device design and cost effectiveness. This work paves a pathway
for developing large quantum-confined NSs of colloidal Pb-free Cs2AgBiBre double perovskites
with suitable properties for high-performance photodetection and other optoelectronic
applications.
2.0 Results and discussion
2.1 Cs2,AgBiBre Nanosheets

Nanosheets of Cs2AgBiBrs double perovskites were synthesized using the low-temperature
crystallization approach first developed by Liu et al. in 2021, with some modifications to the final
reaction temperature and amount of oleic acid (OA) ligand used in the synthesis 7, An increase
in the amount of OA (from 1.0 ml to 1.5 ml) allowed for the synthesis of Csz,AgBiBre NSs at a
higher final reaction temperature of 250 °C (instead of 230 °C), allowing for the synthesis of
laterally larger NSs without any structural distortion. In brief, the precursors; silver nitrate
(AgNO), bismuth bromide (BiBr3), l-octadecene (ODE), OA, oleylamine (OLAm), and
hydrobromic acid (HBr) were added into a three-necked flask, degassed at 120 °C, and heated to
200 °C to fully dissolve the mixture under continuous Ar flow. The solution was cooled to room
temperature, followed by the injection of Cs-oleate and stirring for 10 min. The mixture was then
heated to 250 °C for 10 min to obtain NSs of Cs2,AgBiBre. The growth mechanism of the
nanostructures through the self-assembly of smaller platelets into larger ones has been proposed
and explained in a previous study *!. Given appropriate reaction conditions and a higher reaction
temperature, the small nanoplatelets will acquire more thermal and kinetic energy, causing them
to migrate faster, increase their reactivity, and yield larger NSs. The roles that ligands and
temperature play in preparing quantum-confined NSs of Cs2AgBiBre double perovskites are
investigated and will be discussed in more detail in section 2.2.

Figure 1a shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the synthesized
Cs,AgBiBre NSs (Figure Sla shows a more expanded view at a lower magnification). The
micrograph revealed NSs with rectangular shapes and a wide lateral size distribution of 0.3-1.4
uum. The maximum lateral size of 1.4 um observed for the NSs is way more than double the highest
lateral dimension previously obtained for the colloidal nanoplatelets of the material °” 7*!, The
lateral growth of the nanoplatelets into larger NSs was induced by an increase in the quantity of
OA in the reaction solution, which provided a suitable acid-base equilibrium for the ligands and
enabled the appropriate shelling of the platelets that allowed for the reaction to be sustained at 250
°C without distorting the structure and composition of the material. Higher reaction temperature
increases the thermal energy in the system, which enhances the migration and growth of smaller
platelets into NSs. For application of Cs,AgBiBrs as photodetectors, NSs with higher lateral
dimensions will effectively bridge the electrode spacing and reduce grain boundaries, which can
serve as traps for charge carriers, thereby promoting charge transport and device performance 3%
31] X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements conducted on the fabricated NSs showed patterns that
emphatically aligned with the cubic phase of the crystal structure of Cs2.AgBiBre according to
ICSD card number 01-087-9014 and exhibited an orientation in the <001> direction when
deposited on the substrates, as seen in the high intensity observed for (400) and (200) planes
(Figure 1b). The low-angle diffraction patterns revealed periodic peaks, which indicate that the
NSs are stacked along the <001> direction (Figure S1b). The periodicities of 4.0 and 3.5 nm were
deduced from equidistant reflections in the low-angle XRD patterns, which reveal a stacking
behavior of single ultrathin nanosheet layers to form the quasi-2D nanostructures. The difference
between these two values is approximately equal to a half unit cell of the Cs,AgBiBrg (~0.57 nm,

4
called further as monolayer (ML)), meaning that the thickness of individual 2D layers increases
by one ML of [Ag, Bi]Br octahedrons. The size of a unit cell was calculated from the XRD data
using Bragg's law and the Miller indices (Table $1). Considering the length of OLAm to be ~1.7
nm 81, the thickness of the individual nanosheet layer is then estimated to be ~1.8 nm in the first
case and ~2.3 nm in the second case. The high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) performed on a single
nanosheet of Cs2AgBiBre further affirms good crystallinity with clear lattice fringes over the whole
sheet (Figure 1c). Lattice d-spacing of 2.8 and 4.0 A were calculated from the lattice fringe and
assigned to the (400) and (220) of the cubic structure of bulk Cs2AgBiBro. The fast Fourier
transform (FFT) pattern derived from the HR-TEM analysis further affirms the material’s cubic
structure (Figure 82). Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) analysis conducted on a single
sheet also shows growth along the [001] zone axis (Figure 1d) for the cubic crystal of Cs,AgBiBre.
The lattice spacing calculated from the observed planes in the SAED image matches well with the
values calculated from the XRD pattern of the Cs2AgBiBre NSs, as given in Table S1. TEM/energy
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (TEM-EDS) measurements detected signals for all the elements of
the NSs with an atomic weight ratio of 1.9:1.0:1.1:6.8 for Cs:Ag:Bi:Br in line with the expected
2:1:1:6 stoichiometry of the material (Figure S3a). EDS elemental mapping done on Cs2AgBiBro
NSs (HR-TEM micrograph shown in Figure S3b) revealed a uniform distribution of the
constituent elements across the material’s surface (Figure S3c-f). Atomic force microscopy
(AFM) analysis revealed stacked NSs that are 5.7-19.8 nm thick (Figure le and f). The thinnest
structures of ~5.7 nm align well with the consideration of two OLAm layers with an inorganic part
of ca. 2 nm. The thickness of individual ultra-thin layers would then correspond to about 1.5 unit
cells or 3 [Ag, Bi]Br ML, and the thickness of 2.3 nm would correspond to 4 ML.

The absorption spectrum of the Cs2AgBiBre NSs is given in Figure 1g and revealed an excitonic
absorption peak centered at 2.83 eV (437.8 nm), which is near the band edge, and is due to the 6s—
6p transition of Bi in the [BiBre]* octahedra of the material’s crystal structure % 39! The
absorption at higher energies with a shoulder at about 3.40 eV (365.1 nm) results from direct
bandgap absorption, similar to previous reports '” '? *4], A very weak absorbance feature is
observed at about 2.55 eV, which we attribute to excitations from the few occurrences of NSs with
high number of stacked layers (Figure la and Figure Sla) and bulk-like nanostructure’s
properties. The NSs exhibited broad PL with an emission peak position at 644.8 nm, a FWHM of
159.9 nm, and a red-shift with respect to the absorption peak of 207.0 nm. The broad emission
spectrum and huge Stokes shift are considered to be a result of strong electron-phonon coupling
and emission from self-trap excitons, previously widely discussed for different types of
perovskites!*> °°]. The room temperature time-resolved PL decay was fitted to a tri-exponential
function, which produced a fast and intermediate component with lifetimes of 5.9 and 163.2 ns,
respectively, and a slow decay of 3.2 ps (Figure 1h). The relatively faster and intermediate decay
processes are attributed to the recombination processes due to surface defects and trap states. The
slow component is associated with radiative recombination processes linked to self-trapped
exciton states, which are assumed to be easily depopulated by structural defects !'?-74!,

2:2 Role of Temperature and Ligands

The role of the final reaction temperature in the colloidal synthesis of Cs2AgBiBre double
perovskites on their structural and optical characteristics was investigated. Figure 2a shows the
TEM image of the samples prepared at final reaction temperatures ranging from 200 to 290 °C.
The samples prepared at 200 °C disclosed small nanoplatelets (10-50 nm) and few large sheets
with lateral dimensions ranging from 50 to 500 nm. The lateral size of the nanoplatelets increases
with the reaction temperature up to 250 °C, where nanosheets with a maximum lateral size of
1.4 um were obtained. As mentioned before, this enhanced lateral growth is due to an increase in
the thermal energy in the system at such a high temperature, which promotes the migration and
growth of smaller nanoplatelets into larger sheets. At the final reaction temperature of 260 °C, the
nanosheets began to deform and eventually produced bulk-like particles at 290 °C. This
deformation is due to high reactivity at elevated temperatures that causes instability in the shelling
of the nanoplatelets by the ligands, leading to inhomogeneous crystal growth, formation of
byproducts, and eventual growth into bulk-like crystals. The XRD (Figure S4a) affirms the good
quality of the crystals prepared at final reaction temperatures between 200-250 °C, as all the peaks
observed clearly matched the cubic phase of Cs2AgBiBre double perovskites. Extra XRD peaks
were observed for samples prepared at 260 °C and above, at 20 values of 30.95, 44.34, and 50.08°,
which are associated with the (200), (220), and (222) planes of the cubic crystal structure of AgBrs,
respectively (ICSD card number: 01-071-4692). Furthermore, the intensity of the XRD peaks
along the z-direction increases significantly, especially for samples prepared at 270-290 °C, which
affirms the growth of the NSs to bulk-like particles. The UV-Vis absorption spectra show confined
excitonic excitation peaks around 2.83 eV (expected to be near the band edge) for samples prepared
between 200-250 °C. The exciton absorption peaks were broadened and red-shifted by 0.06 and
0.11 eV for the samples prepared at 270 and 290 °C, respectively, and implies a change towards
bulk-like nanostructures of Cs2zAgBiBro. Further extending the final reaction time beyond the
normal 10 min (20-60 min) also resulted in the formation of byproducts and eventual growth
towards bulk-like particles after 60 min, which is also due to unstable ligand shells around the
platelets and excessive reactivity in the system (Figure S5a and S5b). The excitonic absorption
peaks became broadened and red-shifted by 0.02 and 0.07eV when the final reaction time was
increased to 20 and 60 min, respectively, which indicates a decrease in quantum confinement. All
the samples prepared under different reaction temperature and time conditions exhibited broad PL
emission at similar wavelengths of 644.8 + 0.04 nm (Figure S4c and inset of Figure S5c).

Another crucial factor in the colloidal synthesis of nanostructures is the role ligands play in
controlling their shape, size, uniformity, and structural defects. The role of key ligands - OA and
OLAm, used in the synthesis of Cs,AgBiBre, was studied by varying the concentration of each
ligand while keeping other reaction parameters fixed. Optimal conditions for obtaining large NSs
were observed at concentrations of 1.0-1.5 mL for OA and 1.0 mL for OLAm and a final reaction
temperature of 250 °C. Figure 2b shows the TEM micrographs of Cs2zAgBiBre samples prepared
at various concentrations of OA. A lower concentration of OA (0.5 ml) largely produces small
nanoplatelets of 5-80 nm size and some byproducts of AgBr3, as seen in the XRD data (Figure
S6a). The interaction between OA and the cations on the surface of Cs2AgBiBre nanocrystal is
very weak, while OLAm binds strongly to the nanocrystals (NCs), as earlier reported by Zhang et
al. in 2019. Zhang et. al. backed this with experimental evidence from nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) and nuclear overhauser effect (NOE) spectroscopy studies °7!; however, the fundamental
reason for the weak interaction of OA with the surface of the NCs has not yet been fully clarified.
Notwithstanding, since OA and OLAm are both L-type ligands but with a carboxylic and amine
headgroups, respectively '*!, the pH of the nanocrystal’s surface was probably not basic enough
to allow for the deprotonation of OA to form NCs-OA bonds. An increase in pH has been
previously linked to enhanced deprotonation of OA on material’s surfaces 9:4, Nonetheless, the
low amount of the OA ligand limits the acid-base equilibrium of the binary ligands needed to
provide a stable ligand shell for the crystal growth of CszAgBiBre NSs. Further increase in OA
concentration above 1.5 mL results in the formation of inhomogeneous NSs. The uniformity of the
crystals and the formation of byproducts were highly sensitive to the amount of OLAm in the
reaction system, since OLAm binds strongly to the surface of the nanocrystals. Figure 2b presents
the TEM images of Cs2AgBiBre samples prepared at various concentrations of OLAm. The OLAm
concentration of 1.0 ml favours the growth of CszAgBiBrs NSs with no noticeable byproducts.
Low concentration of OLAM led to a limited ligand shell and increased the reactivity in the system,
leading to the growth of inhomogeneous sheets. Meanwhile, a further increase in OLAm
concentration to 1.5 ml largely produces thick micro- and nanocrystals and a few nanosheets.
Excess OLAm (2.0-2.5 ml) results in the formation of a densely packed ligand shell around the
cations, which makes it difficult for complex structures to form and favours the formation of
simpler compounds such as AgBr3, BiBr3, and Cs3BizBro as byproducts (Figure $7a). So, while
an increase or decrease in the ratio of OA/OLAm leads to the formation of byproducts, OA largely
affects the lateral dimension of the nanocrystals, while OLAm significantly influences the
uniformity of the NSs and their structural integrity. Interestingly, the excitonic absorption peak
and PL emission positions were not affected by the variation of OA (Figure S6b and S6c) and
OLAm (Figure S7b and S7c) concentrations in the reaction mixture: an indication of a relatively
stable band structure that is not affected by morphological changes.

temperatures, b) using various concentrations of OA, and c) OLAm. The scale bars shown in the
micrographs represent 1 jim.
2.3 Photodetection properties of Cs2AgBiBre nanosheets

Generally, photodetection involves the absorption of photons by a suitable material followed by
optical transitions that produce free charge carriers, which are extracted at the electrodes with the
aid of an electric field to yield photoinduced current. Cs2AgBiBre is a promising material for many
applications in optoelectronic devices, especially where photon absorption and charge extraction
are paramount, such as photodetection. Moreover, Cs2AgBiBro is Pb-free and has exhibited
superior stability under ambient conditions, temperature, and exposure to light over other
conventional halide hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites such as MAPbBX3 (X=I, Br, or Cl) 4!
47] Tn addition, they have shown desirable properties suitable for photodetection applications, such
as a long carrier lifetime |! 3], a low minority carrier diffusion length of 700 nm up to 2.44 um
(down to 123 K) ™), and high resistivity that results in low noise and reduced dark current 4),

A schematic representation of the fabricated quasi-2D Cs2AgBiBrs NSs-based photodetection
device is presented in the inset of Figure 3(a) with an expanded view given in Figure S8a. The
device consists of the colloidal Cs,AgBiBrs NSs deposited onto two interdigited Au electrodes,
and the SEM micrograph, which shows all the regions on the device’s surface, is given in Figure
S8b. The device was annealed at 200 °C for 10 min to improve ohmic contacts and remove
insulating ligand barriers that can limit charge transport and device performance. The SEM image
of the NSs before and after annealing is shown in Figures S8c and S8d, respectively. The
micrographs disclosed Cs2AgBiBre NSs for the annealed device and unannealed sample (deposited
on Si/SiO substrate), with no noticeable difference in shape and size. The UV-Vis absorption of
the NSs that was annealed and redispersed into toluene also shows an absorption spectrum similar
to the freshly prepared colloidal samples and comparable confined excitonic peak positions
(Figure 89a). Furthermore, the XRD of the annealed and the unannealed colloidal NSs drop-casted
onto glass substrates shows a similar XRD pattern for both samples (Figure S9b). The microstrain
(€) in the crystal lattice was evaluated from XRD data using the Williamson-Hall method, and
similar values of 1.15 and 1.21 x 10° were obtained for both annealed and unannealed Cs2AgBiBre
NSs, respectively (Figure S10a and S10b). Therefore, optical and structural analysis suggest that
the annealing of the photodetection device did not significantly alter the structural and optical
features of the NS.

The current density-voltage curves of the Cs2,AgBiBre NSs photodetection device in dark and
under illumination conditions are presented in Figure 3a. A dark current density of 4.0 x 10%
A/cm? was observed for the photodetection device at a bias voltage of 5 V. This low dark current
response is likely due to the charge injection barrier at the metal-semiconductor interface > 441,
The photocurrent notably increases under illumination and produces a remarkable on/off ratio of
2.39 x 104 at 17.7 mW/cm”. This is higher than many reported values for Cs2AgBiBro ?° 4°48! and
some Pb-based hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite photodetectors (Table 1). The on/off ratio of
the photodetection device increases with increasing power density (Figure S11a) due to enhanced
photogeneration of charge carriers. The high on/off ratio recorded for the photodetection device is
attributed to the low dark current attained by the device, coupled with the high quality of the NSs,
reduction of detrimental trap states at grain boundaries because of their large lateral sizes, and long
charge carrier lifetimes, which are beneficial for charge extraction and high device performance.

10
The large lateral dimension of the synthesized NSs will bridge the electrode spacing of the device
more efficiently, and limit defects due to grain boundaries and the consequent charge
recombination to improve charge transport and photodetection performance 3"!, More so, unlike
many Pd-based organic-inorganic perovskites such as MAPbX: (Br, I, and Cl), the Cs2AgBiBro
NSs could withstand high-temperature calcination (200 °C) without any significant distortion of
their crystal structure, which was vital in improving charge transport and device performance. The
dependence of photocurrent on incident power density is presented in Figure 3b and Figure S11b.
The photocurrent increases with increasing power density of the incident photons because of the
enhancement in the photogeneration of excitons. The photodetection device mildly treated at 50
°C for 30 min produces a photocurrent that is only 10° higher than the dark current (Figure S12a
and $12b): one order less than the value obtained for the annealed device at 200° C (Figure 3a).
The reduced performance is mainly attributed to poor ohmic contacts at the Au/Cs2AgBiBre NSs
interface and the presence of excess organic ligands that served as non-conducting barriers for
charge transport. The annealing of Cs2AgBiBro-based photodetectors at 75-285 °C has been
previously reported, owing to the good thermal stability of CsxAgBiBro !"® 3449-90),

Transient photocurrent density was also measured at different bias voltages for the Cs2AgBiBro
NSs photodetection device at an incident power density of 2.08 mW/cm? and a signal frequency

11
of 50 mHz (equivalent to a laser on/off duration of 20 s). The photocurrent density increases with
increasing bias voltage (Figure 3c) due to the enhancement of electric field and carrier drift
velocity that promote charge transport and extraction. In a similar measurement at a constant
voltage of 2.0 V, the transient photocurrent also increases with increasing power density of the
incident photons as expected (Figure S13a). A linear dynamic range (LDR) was deduced for the
Cs2AgBiBre NSs photodetectors from their photocurrent density measurements at various power
densities, as given in Figure 3d. The LDR was evaluated using Equation 14);

Imax
LDR = 20log (==) 1
where Imax and Imin denote the maximum and minimum photocurrent within the linear range,
respectively. The LDR evaluated for the device is 67 dB. Lower LDR values have been reported
for some Cs2AgBiBr6-based photodetectors 13], as well as many transport-layer-free Pb-based
organic-inorganic hybrid photodetectors §4°°!, The LDR defines the region within which the
output of the photodetection device scales linearly with respect to the intensity of the incident light
input: a necessary condition for sustaining a consistent responsivity §7!. The plot of photocurrent
against incident power was fitted to the power law I = AP®, where A is a constant and @ is a
parameter that reflects the trapping and recombination processes of photogenerated carriers in the
device (0 < 1) 47), After fitting the plot to the above relation, a 0 value of 0.69 was obtained for
the photodetection device (Figure $13b). Fractional values of @ close to | are desirable as they
indicate suppression of charge recombination processes in the device '°!. The 6 value obtained for
the Cs2AgBiBre NSs photodetector heated at 50 °C was 29.0 % less when compared to the device
annealed at 200 °C during device fabrication (Figure $13b and S$13c). This is linked to the
limitation of charge transport posed by poor ohmic contact and non-conducting organic ligands,
which leads to high charge trapping rates and recombination. Furthermore, to evaluate the trap
density, Ni, of the Cs2AgBiBrs NSs photodetector, the space charge limited current (SCLC)
analysis was performed, and the dark current density is plotted against various bias voltages to
obtain the value of the trap filling limit (TFL) voltage, Vrri, as shown in Figure 3e. A linear
response is seen in the ohmic region at lower voltages, as indicated in the plot. At a higher voltage,
a deviation from this ohmic behavior is observed at the trap filling limit, where a Vrri value of
0.805 V was obtained for the device. At the TFL, the trap states are occupied by charge carriers.
So, the trap density can be evaluated using Equation 2:

_ 2&rtoVTFL
N= 2
where the relative dielectric constant is represented by e- = 51 7], e, denotes the vacuum
permittivity, e is the electronic charge, and the channel length, L = 5 um. The N; of 1.82 x 10!*
cm? was evaluated for the photodetection device. Limiting trap states is paramount for reducing
charge recombination rates and improving carrier extraction to boost photodetection performance.

The 3-dB bandwidth or cut-off frequency, which characterizes the device’s speed, was obtained
from the frequency responses measured at laser pulsing frequencies of 0.05 to 2500 Hz. The
normalized relative photocurrent (Imax-Imin) obtained at different frequencies was plotted as shown

12
in Figure 4a and used to deduce the 3dB frequency of photodetectors at (Imax-Imin)/V2, which
equates to 70.7% of the maximum Imax-Imin value (Figure 4a). A 3dB bandwidth of 363 Hz was
obtained for the device. The response times of the Cs,AgBiBro NSs were evaluated at 400 Hz (near
the 3dB frequency) and yield fast rise and fall times of 857 and 829 1s, respectively (Figure 4b).
Despite the relatively large values related to the intrinsically long lifetimes of the charge carriers,
these response times outperformed many pristine and modified Cs2AgBiBre-based photodetectors
and some conventional organic-inorganic Pb-based perovskite photodetection devices, as outlined
in Table 1. The fast response times obtained for the device can be attributed to the good quality of
colloidal quasi-2D nanocrystals and the large lateral size of the NSs that effectively bridged the
electrode spacing and limits traps due to grain boundaries, which is beneficial for efficient charge
transport.

The photodetection performance of the Cs2AgBiBre NSs was further assessed by evaluating their

different power densities are shown in Figure 4c, while the EQE plot is presented in Figure 4d.
The responsivity, detectivity, and EQE were observed to decrease with increasing laser power
density. This behavior is similar to other observations '*-°*! and is associated with the prevalence
of bimolecular recombination of charge carriers at higher power ©8!. The NSs yield a high
detectivity value of 1.15 x 10!” Jones, outperforming many reported values for pristine and doped
Cs2AgBiBre photodetectors, devices that engage heterojunctions and charge transport layers in
their architecture, and conventional organic-inorganic halide perovskites (Table 1). The
detectivity of the photodetector defines its capacity to detect weak optical signals and is a vital
parameter in determining device performance. The responsivity, which quantifies the photocurrent
per unit area for a given optical power, was evaluated and yields 121 mA/W. An EQE of 40%
was deduced for the device, which represents the ratio of the number of photoexcited charge
carriers extracted to produce photocurrent to the number of incident photons.

The energy band positions and alignment of the Cs2AgBiBro NSs and the Au electrodes in their
equilibrium states before contact are given in Figure 5a. When in contact, electrons will flow from
the semiconductor to the metal to attain equilibrium and a common Fermi level, since the work
function of Au (5.1 eV) “¢l is higher than that of Cs.AgBiBre based on values given in different
reports [5 48 50] This will cause energy band bending at both ends of the Au-Cs:AgBiBrs
interfaces, as illustrated in Figure 5b. Under dark conditions, charge flow is limited by the energy
barrier at the Au-Cs2AgBiBre interfaces, which contributes to the low dark current observed for

15
the photodetector. Under illumination, photogenerated charge carriers are excited to the
conduction band (CB) to form electron-hole pairs. The electrons in the CB are driven towards the
anode while the holes move in the opposite direction. The electric field that results from the
external bias will aid the flow of charge carriers and boost the photocurrent generated by the
device. Furthermore, since the photodetector is made of stacked layers of interconnected
nanosheets, at room temperature, the charge carriers will move from one sheet to the other through
both hopping and tunneling mechanisms, and get extracted at the electrodes. The grain boundaries
would create defects that serve as trap centers for charge carriers, which will limit charge transport
[31] Hence, the large lateral size observed for the NSs helps to limit grain boundaries and
contributes to the high photodetection performance recorded in the presented structures.

16
The stability of the CszAgBiBre NSs photodetectors was investigated under ambient conditions.
Transient photocurrent was recorded for the device and repeated after storing the sample under
ambient conditions. The device demonstrated excellent stability, showing no noticeable difference
in the on/off photocurrent after being kept under ambient conditions for 80 days (Figure 5c).
Meanwhile, Pb-based organic-inorganic perovskite, MAPbI3, photodetector, has been shown to
lose 16 % of its photocurrent after storage in air for 30 days !°°!. The stability of the NSs is further
affirmed by the structural stability of the material when kept under ambient conditions for over
200 days. The XRD patterns obtain from intermittent measurements performed on the NSs
between day 0 and after over 200 days solely revealed peaks for the cubic phase of Cs2AgBiBre
double perovskites, with similar intensities, and no additional peaks for AgBr or other impurities
(Figure 5d). Furthermore, the Cs2AgBiBre NSs photodetection device exhibited great long-term
photostability and sustained a relatively consistent photocurrent in a transient current measurement
over 5000 s (Figure 5e). The long-term stability test shows a slight initial increase in photocurrent.
This is assumed to be due to some photo-activation phenomena by high-energy photons that
resulted in the healing of some detrimental surface defects ''°!, Further investigation will be
required to fully explain this phenomenon.

3.0 Conclusions

In summary, in this work, quasi-2D Cs2AgBiBre nanosheets (NSs) were developed using the low-
temperature injection colloidal synthesis and used to fabricate high-performance photodetectors.
The reaction temperature and the concentration of ligands (OA and OLAm) played significant
roles in the shape, size, and structural integrity of the synthesized Cs2AgBiBre NSs. The tuning
and optimization of the ligands in the reaction system allowed for the synthesis of Cs2AgBiBro
NSs at a higher final reaction temperature (250 °C), which leads to the formation of larger sheets,
without any structural distortion. Cs,AgBiBre NSs of up to 1.4 um lateral sizes, which are only a
few nm thick, were synthesized. The high-performance photodetectors fabricated using the
Cs2AgBiBro NSs yielded a notably high detectivity and on/off ratio of 1.15 x 10'? Jones and 2.39
x 10+, respectively. The device also recorded responsivity of 121 mA/W, and a fast sub-
millisecond rise and decay time of 857 and 829 us, respectively. The performance of the
Cs2AgBiBre NSs photodetector is remarkable, especially because the device is free of transport
layers, which often complicates device design and reduces the cost effectiveness for practical
applications. This work demonstrates the potential of micro-sized colloidal quasi-2D Cs2AgBiBro
lead-free double perovskite NSs with desirable characteristics for the design of high-performance
photodetectors and other optoelectronic applications.

4.0 Experimental
4.1 Chemicals

Silver nitrate (AgNO3, 99.8%), bismuth bromide (BiBr3, >98.0%), Cesium carbonate (Cs2COs,
99.9%), l-octadecene (ODE, technical grade 90%), oleic acid (OA, technical grade 90%),
oleylamine (OLAm, technical grade 70%), hydrobromic acid (HBr, 47%), and toluene (from

17
VWR, 99.5%). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless stated, and used as
received without further purification.

4.2 Preparation of Cs-oleate solution

10 ml of OLAm was added to 825 mg of Cs2CO3 that was measured and loaded into a 50 mL 3-
neck flask. In a Schlenk line, under continuous Ar flow, the mixture was heated to 120 °C and
degassed by applying vacuum pressure for 30 min. The solution was further heated to 150 °C, kept
at the same temperature for | hr under Ar flow, and allowed to naturally cool down to room
temperature for subsequent use.

4.3 Synthesis of Cs2AgBiBro

The procedure developed by Liu et al. for the preparation of CszAgBiXs (X=Cl, Br, and J),
nanoplatelets was used with some modifications to the final reaction temperature and the amount
of OA used to prepare quasi-2D Cs2AgBiBre nanosheets. In brief, 0.2 mmol AgNOs, 0.1 mmol
BiBr3, 4 mL ODE, 1.5 mL OA, 1.0 ml OLAm, and 0.1 mL HBr were loaded into a 25 mL three-
neck flask, heated to 120 °C under argon flow, and degassed by applying vacuum for 30 mins to
remove residual air and water. After degassing, the mixture was heated to 200 °C for 10 min under
Argon flow to fully dissolve all precursors and was allowed to cool naturally to room temperature
(25 °C). At room temperature, 0.3 mL of the prepared Cs-oleate solution was injected into the
mixture and kept for 10 min at room temperature while stirring. The mixture was heated to 250 °C
and kept for 10 min at this temperature. Afterwards, the heating mantle was removed to quench
the reaction and cooled to room temperature. The crude solution obtained was centrifuged at 8000
rpm for 5 min to precipitate the sample from the final reaction mixture. The sample was dispersed
in toluene and centrifuged again under the same conditions as the crude solution. Lastly, the
supernatant was decanted, and the Cs2AgBiBre NSs sample was re-dispersed in 7.5 mL toluene
and stored for further use.

Several samples were also synthesized to investigate the role of temperature and ligands in the
colloidal synthesis of Cs:AgBiBre double perovskites. Samples were prepared, following the same
procedure described for the NSs synthesis above, but at final reaction temperatures of 210, 230,
260, 270, and 290 °C. Also, following the same procedure, additional samples were prepared at
250 °C and final reaction times of 30 and 60 mins. More so, the role of OA in the reaction was
investigated. Additional samples were prepared using 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 2.5 mL of OA in the
reaction system while maintaining 1.0 mL OLAm and other reaction parameters described for the
nonosheets synthesis above. In another set of samples, the amount of OLAm in the reaction
mixture was 0.5, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 mL, while 1.5 mL of OA and other parameters were maintained.
All samples were cleaned following the same procedure described for the Cs,AgBiBre NSs
samples and dispersed in toluene.

18
4.4 Device fabrication

The Si/Si02 substrates were obtained from Addison Engineering, Inc. San Jose, CA (300 nm +
5% thermal oxide and resistivity of 005-020 Q-cm) with interdigitated gold electrodes and 5 um
electrode spacing was used for the fabrication of the photodetectors. The substrates were cleaned
by sonicating in acetone for 2 min and dried with flowing nitrogen gas. 50 uL of the stored
Cs2AgBiBro NSs sample was further dissolved in 50 pL of toluene. 20 uL of the resulting solution
was drop-casted onto the Si/SiO2 substrate (with interdigitated gold electrodes) and allowed to dry
in air. This was repeated once to obtain thin films of Cs2AgBiBro NSs on the substrates. The
devices were placed in a vacuum oven and purged twice with Ar to remove any residual air in the
chamber. The temperature in the oven was increased to 200 °C at a heating rate of ~2 °C/min under
flowing Ar gas, calcined for 10 min, and allowed to cool naturally to room temperature to obtain
quasi-2D Cs2AgBiBre NSs-based photodetection devices.

4.5 Photodetection measurements

The fabricated devices were placed in a probe station and kept under vacuum for evaluation of
photodetection properties. The I-V characteristics of the Cs. AgBiBro NSs photodetection devices
were studied by employing the Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization equipment, with
measurements conducted under dark and various incident light power density and voltage bias
conditions. The 374 nm excitation laser served as the main incident light source. A 405 nm
excitation laser was used to measure I-V responses under different illumination power densities
and bias voltages to study the region within which the photocurrent scales linearly with respect to
the intensity of the incident light (the laser provides much higher power density). Transient current
responses were also measured for the photodetection device under various illumination power
densities and bias voltages. The RIGOL function generator (DG4062) and the illumination for the
laser (374 nm), which was converted into a pulsed light, were used in evaluating the device’s
frequency/time response. Using a power density of 2.08 mW/cm* from the pulse laser, a Tektronix
oscilloscope (TDS2014B), and a bias voltage of 4 V (from SRS70, power source), the current-
frequency response of the photodetection device was measured. The device’s active area is
0.0003632 em?.

4.6 Characterizations

The prepared samples were further diluted in toluene before drop-casting onto transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) copper grids and used to conduct TEM measurements using a Talos-
L120C and EM-912 Omega at 120 kV. High-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) was conducted on
Cs,AgBiBre NSs at 200 KV in STEM mode using a Jeol JEM-ARM200F NeoARM (probe-
corrected) instrument.

A Zeiss EVO/MA10 instrument was used to conduct scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
measurements on CszAgBiBro NSs deposited on bare Si/SiO2 and the interdigitated gold electrode
substrates.

19
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared samples were measured using a Panalytical Aeris
diffractometer with a Bragg-Brentano geometry and a copper anode with an X-ray wavelength of
0.154 nm from the Cu-ka1 line.

An AFM (Park Systems XE-100) instrument in non-contact mode (ARROW-NCR-20, force
constant k = 42Nm-1, resonance frequency at 285 kHz) was used to measure the surface
topography of the samples, which were prepared by drop-casting the diluted samples on Si/Si02
substrates.

The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the samples were obtained with a Lambda 1050+
spectrophotometer from Perkin Elmer equipped with an integration sphere.

A spectrofluorometer FS5 fluorescence spectrometer from Edinburgh Instruments was used to
obtain the PL spectra of the samples. The time-resolved PL measurements were conducted using
a picosecond laser attached to the spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 375 nm and a
repetition rate of 100 kHz. The decay profiles are tail-fitted with a bi-exponential function.
