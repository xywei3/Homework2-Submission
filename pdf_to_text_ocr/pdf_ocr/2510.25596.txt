We combine weak lensing, galaxy clustering, cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing, and
their cross-correlations (so-called 6x2pt) to constrain cosmology and baryonic feedback scenarios
using data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 MAGLIM catalog and the Planck satellite PR4
data release. We include all data points in the DES Y3 cosmic shear two-point correlation function
(2PCF) down to 2.'5 and model baryonic feedback processes via principal components (PCs) that are
constructed from the ANTILLES simulations. We find a tight correlation between the amplitude of
the first PC Q; and mean normalized baryon mass fraction ¥, = f,/(Qb/Qm) from the ANTILLES
simulations and employ an independent Y, measurement from Akino et al. (2022) as a prior of
Qi. We train a neural network 6 x 2pt emulator to boost the analysis speed by O(103), which
enables us to run an impressive number of simulated analyses to validate our analysis against
various systematics. For our 6x2pt analysis, we find Ss = 0.8073 + 0.0094 when including a Qi
prior from Y, observations. This level of cosmological constraining power allows us to put tight
constraints on the strength of baryonic feedback. We find Q, = 0.0251°'035 for our 6x2pt analysis
and Qi = 0.043 + 0.016 when combining with external information from Planck, ACT, DESI. All
these results indicate weak feedback, e.g., the tensions to Illustris (Qi = 0.095) and OWLS AGN
T8.7 (Qi = 0.137) are 2.90-3.30 and 4.70-5.90, respectively.

I. INTRODUCTION

In this paper, we constrain cosmology and baryonic
feedback with a joint analysis of weak lensing, galaxy
clustering, and CMB lensing at the 2PCF-statistics
evel. This so-called 6 x 2pt analysis has become a
well-established setup when combining data from_pho-
ometric galaxy surveys (e.g., Dark Energy Survey"| Hy-
er Suprime Camera Subaru Strategic Progra Kilo-
Degree Survey) with CMB experiments (Planck satel-
ite missior{*] outh Pole Telescopd?}| Atacama Cosmol-
ogy Telescop
Similar joint analyses have been published in the lit-
erature [I}{8]. These differ in terms of datasets used in
he analysis, analysis choices, and modeling/covariance
strategies. They all significantly boost constraining
ower over single-probe analyses, which is a valid strat-
egy to discover new physics if the individual probes are
not in tension. If differences between individual probes
exist, joint analysis is disallowed and the tensions them-
selves can be used as hints for new physics.

One of these interesting (mild) tensions in the cosmol-
ogy community is the so-called Sg tension, which refers
to the fact that Sg = ogy/Qm/0.3 measured by sev-
eral low redshift weak lensing surveys [9HI3] are lower
chan the prediction of primary CMB [14] [15]. The ten-
sion quantified in these papers is at most at the 20
evel. Other recent analyses found Sg to be consis-
ent with the primary CMB well within 2¢ level [16}
(2T]. [21] selects a blue source galaxy sample that is de-
signed to have minimal intrinsic alignment and finds an
Sg consistent with Planck in 0.340 with baryonic feed-
back marginalized over. show that different nonlin-
ear matter power spectrum models, intrinsic alignment
models, and baryonic feedback mitigation methods can
all impact the Sg result at a level that is relevant when
discussing the aforementioned tension. Solely attributing
che tension to baryonic physics generally requires a feed-
back as strong as cosmos-OWLS AGN log(ATheat /K) =
8.7 [22] or Ilustris [23] [24], which is in contradiction
‘o several weak lensing analyses that find weaker mat-
er power spectrum suppression due to baryonic feed-
back [16] [19] [25] [26]. Consequently, weak lensing analy-

ses with cosmology fixed to Planck values prefer stronger

feedback [27] [28].

While weak lensing observations do not indicate
strong baryonic scenarios like cosmo-OWLS AGN T8.5,
these are, however, favored by thermal/kinematic Sun-
yaev—Zel’dovich (tSZ/kSZ) measurements and by X-ray
measurements of the luminosity of galaxy groups and
clusters. Using baryonic feedback models [29}35], that

self-consistently predict electron pressure and matter
power spectrum, recent SZ and X-ray observations [36}+
indeed find evidence for baryonic feedback scenarios
stronger than those preferred by weak lensing. We note
however that the halos probed by these measurements
differ, which makes a comparison challenging.

In this paper we jointly constrain cosmology and the
strength of baryonic feedback processes using six two-
point correlation functions: cosmic shear £€4(%), pro-
jected galaxy clustering wf (v), CMB lensing band-power
Cee, and corresponding cross-correlations:  galaxy-
galaxy lensing 2°(), galaxy-CMB lensing wG,(0), and
galaxy shear-CMB lensing w%,.(0). Here a, b are tomog-
raphy bin indices, ¥ is the mean angular separation of
each bin, and Ly, is the mean multipole of each angular
bin of the CMB lensing band-power.

We closely follow [5] (X24) from now on) in terms
of methodology in that we adopt a principal compo-
nent analysis-based (PCA) method to mitigate impacts
of baryonic feedback [46H48]. We note that com-
pared to other baryonic feedback mitigation methods
(e.g. BACCOEmu [BI] [49], BCemu [32] [50] [51], HM-
CopE20 [35] {52} (53), etc.), the PCA-based method covers
the most variance with as few degrees of freedom (d.o.f.)
as possible, and does not depend on the cosmology prior
of baryon models [54]. It is also robust to cosmology-
dependent baryonic feedback strength [55].

Since the PCA technique captures the variance of an
underlying set of simulations, it is only indirectly con-
nected to physical parameters and is sensitive only to the
hysics included in the simulations. Compared to [X24]
we significantly upgrade our baryonic physics model us-
ing the recent ANTILLES simulation suite [56]. We also
include external information on the baryon mass fraction
from X-ray and optical observations in our analysis.
Other notable upgrades compared to [X24] are the un-
derlying dataset of our analysis and the approach to de-
ermine analysis choices: TIn[X24] we obtain our measure-
ments from Dark Energy Survey Year 1 (DES-Y1) and
Planck PR3 data, whereas in this paper, we use the more
constraining DES-Y3 MAGLIM catalogs and the Planck
PR4 data release. To derive optimal analysis choices, we
employ the recently developed machine learning acceler-
ated inference [58}61| concept, which speeds up MCMC
analyses by several orders of magnitude. This allows us
o run hundreds of likelihood analyses to precisely map
out the impact of different analysis choices and to test
corresponding robustness.

We structure this paper as follows: we summarize the
6x2pt measurements in Sec. [II] and the baryonic feed-
back modeling method with the ANTILLES simulations
in Sec. [I] (1 We explain our modeling methodology, the
machine learning accelerated inference technique, and its
implementation in Sec Section [V] disc usses the sys-
tematics analysis choices, scale cut choice, and model val-
idation. Blinding strategy, results on cosmology param-
eters, and robustness tests are shown in Sec. [vq Results
on baryonic feedback strength are discussed in Sec.

We conclude in Sec. [VIII]

II. DATA
1. Dark Energy Survey Year 3 data

We (re-)measure the following three 2PCFs (so-called
3 x 2pt) between DES yf] MAGLIM lens sample [62+
[66], and METACALIBRATION source sample [67}69] using
TREECoRR [70].

where R® is the mean shear response of the source sam-

shear when counting pairs. €{ yo are the two shear com-
ponents, 1% /p are indicator functions of the randomized
or truth lens catalog, and ()cat means average over the
catalog. Our binning corresponds to the standard DES
Y3 data vector (20 logarithmic bins from 2.'5 to 250’).
We choose the same binning for the CMB Lensing cross-
correlation 2PCFs defined further below. Importantly,
our measured €4°() and 7#°(9) use the most recent to-
mography bin assignment for the DES Y3 source sample
(SOMPZ version v0.50, see [21] for details).

2. Planck PR4 CMB Lensing

The CMB lensing measurement Cy is based on the
Planck PR4 CMB lensing convergence may] [22] in this
analysis. The PR4 map has about 20 percent higher S/N
han the Planck 2018 data release [73] due various up-
grades including: (1) around 8 percent additional data
measured from satellite repointing maneuvers (2) joint
Wiener-filtering of the CMB temperature and polariza-
ion maps during quadratic estimator, including treat-
ment for inhomogeneous noise (3) additional Wiener-
filtering of the reconstructed lensing convergence field
before band-power estimation (4) more simulations for
he lensing reconstruction.

analysis (see Table [I). Using the standard signal-to-noise
ratio (S/N) definition, S/N = Vy? = VD-C'-D,
where D is the data vector and C is the covariance
matrix, we find S/N of wgx(¥) and wsx(0) to be 22.5
and 20.4, respectively. We note that [3] reports S/N
of 19.6 (32.2) and 16.9 (18.2) for their linear-scale (all
data points included) galaxy-CMB lensing and shear-
CMB lensing 2PCFs with DES Y3 x Planck+SPT CMB
lensing map, respectively.

The Planck PR4 lensing map does not include varia-
ion maps with alternative tSZ deprojection treatments.
However, [X24] shows that cross-correlations measured us-
ing DES Y1 and Planck PR3 do not have detectable con-
amination from tSZ/CIB. Given that we adopt the same
smoothing scale for the PR4 map, we expect the bias due
o tSZ/CIB contamination to be negligible. We also ver-
ify that w?.(0) and w%,.() are not biased by the MC
norm ; which is due to the higher-order coupling
etween Planck and DES Y3 footprint.

3. X-ray measurements

The baryon mass fraction fi, is a sensitive probe of the
aryonic feedback strength in our Universe [50] [75178].
n this paper, we consider corresponding measurements
from 136 Hyper Suprime Cam (HSC)-XXL galaxy groups
and clusters presented in [57]. The sample is selected
from the XMM-Newton XXL survey second data release
DR2) [79] with spectroscopic confirmation, and overlap
with the HSC-Subaru Strategic Program (SSP) footprint.
The weak-lensing masses MS) of the 136 XXL groups
and clusters are measured from HSC-SSP [80]. X-ray lu-
minosity Lx, and hot gas mass M,as are measured from
he XXL survey, and stellar mass /, is measured from
HSC-SSP and SDSS DR16 multi-band photometry. This
multi-wavelength coverage allows a census of the total
yaryon budget in the HSC-XXL group and cluster sam-

ple. We want to utilize this fj, measurement to inform
us about the baryonic feedback strength in the universe
and help improve the constraining power on cosmology.

To build relation between baryonic mass and the un-
observable halo mass, conduct linear regression to fit
the total stellar mass M,., brightest central galaxy (BCG)
mass Mpca, and gas mass Mgas as a function of the un-
derlying true halo mass Mendel

Table 5 of and draw random realizations of Yz on
Mso0 grid between 10'8 and 1014 Mo. The total baryon

N (0.340, 0.077) is the mass contribution from ICL, and
N(,0) annotates a Gaussian distribution with mean jy
and standard deviation o.

The uncertainty of fpiue and ficr are quoted from [57].
Cosmology is marginalized over by drawing Qn and Qy
from the nine-year WMAP result [81]. An additional 15
percent uncertainty is applied to the stellar mass to ac-
count for uncertainty in the initial mass function. Ran-
dom realizations of equation are drawn with these
uncertainties, and we evaluate the mean and standard
deviation of Y¥;,(Mp,) from the random draw.

We are particularly interested in the mean normal-
ized baryon mass fraction Y, over halos of mass within
(1013, 1014] Mo since that is the halo mass range that our
&4(¥) is most sensitive to, given the redshift distribution
of the DES Y3 METACAL sample and the scale cut of
€+(V) [29] [56]. We calculate the mean and error of log Y;,
from the random realizations,

(log Y,) = —0.285,
o (log Y,) = 0.076.

9 We choose Msoo as the definition of halo mass in this work, and
we use Mso9 and M,, interchangeably.

10 We use fi, and Y;, interchangeably when referring to the concept
of using baryon mass fraction to trace feedback strength. How-
ever, when we use baryon mass fraction to quantitatively inform
our analysis, we always mean Yj,.
Recently, the eROSITA survey [39] has found a sys-
tematic lower fgas-My relation than other literature [e.g.
[82}85]. [89] stacks the eROSITA X-ray surface bright-
ness for an optically selected GAMA group sample [86],
and measures the electron density and gas mass from the
stacked X-ray surface brightn This avoids the X-ray
selection effects, which will bias the fgas to higher values
if not corrected, since galaxy groups and clusters with low
X-ray surface brightness are not included in the sample.
The resulting fgas measurement is consistent with [45].
While a detailed discussion of the conflicting gas mass
fraction is beyond the scope of this work, we explore the
impact of a lower gas mass fraction on our results in

Sec.

Ill. MODELING BARYONIC PHYSICS

Since we intend to keep all the cosmic shear data points
down to 2.'5, our analysis requires modeling of bary-
onic feedback processes. Following [X24] we adopt PCA
baryon mitigation to account for baryonic effects on small
scales [4648]. In this approach, PCs are constructed di-
rectly in the model vector space, which in our case means
they span the difference between the gravity-only 2PCFs
and the baryonic 2PCF's computed from a range of simu-
lations. After the construction of the PCs, the full model
vector is calculated by

Mbary(P, Q) = M(p) + 55 Qi PGi, (6)
i=1

where the amplitudes Q; are varied during analysis, and
M(p) is the gravity-only model vector. We note that in
this paper, we construct PCs for all shear-based auto and
cross-correlations. This is different from where it
was sufficient to build PCs for the shear auto-correlation
2PCF only, given the larger statistical uncertainty of the
DES Y1 dataset. For example, a strong feedback scenario
in ANTILLES that corresponds to —20 baryon mass
fraction can results in AXR = 5.8 and Ax, = 15,
which are not negligible for our analysis.

A. Baryon feedback simulations

In this work, we use the ANTILLES simulations
suite [56], a suite comprised of 400 simulations of box
size 100 Mpc/h with 256° particles for baryonic and
dark matter each. Different simulations have different
galaxy formation efficiency (controlled by wind velocity
and mass-loading factor of kinetic wind stellar feedback)
and AGN feedback strength (controlled by temperature
increase, the number of neighboring gas particles to heat,
and the gas density threshold to start black hole accre-
tion).

The 400 simulations are carefully chosen to uniformly
sample the feedback parameters using 200 Latin hyper-

cube nodes, and each node is run with two hydrody-
namic solvers (smoothed-particle hydrodynamics or clas-
sic SPH, and Anarchy SPH). The simulations have been
demonstrated to be sufficiently large for capturing rela-
sive effects of baryonic to dark matter power spectrum
[76} (89) and span a large range of feedback, including
extreme feedback scenarios.

To test the PCA baryonic feedback mitigation, we se-
ect three special feedback scenarios from the ANTILLES
simulations and exclude them during PC generation. The
chree scenarios are chosen based on their mean baryon
mass fraction within halo mass range [1013, 10'4] Mo.
They are consistent, 20 higher, or 20 lower than the ob-
served baryon mass fraction in [57], and we refer to them
as the mean, weak, and strong feedback, since stronger
feedback leads to lower baryon mass fraction.

We show the range of small-scale P(k) suppression
spanned by ANTILLES simulations (pink, green, and
blue solid lines for three special ANTILLES scenarios,
and grey lines for the other ANTILLES simulations) and
other simulations used in[X24]in the left panels of Fig
These figures also show the impact of differ-
ent models of the nonlinear matter power spectrum
(BACCOgEmu [49} [91], CosmicEmu {92} [93], Evu-
CLIDEMU2 [94], and HMCope2020 [35}) in the left pan-
els of Fig. [Jas a comparison. Note that the uncertainty
from nonlinear matter power spectrum can be compa-
rable to baryonic feedback at k > 10h/Mpc. We ex-
plore possible cross-talk between the two systematics in
Sec. [VA]

In the right panels o Fig. [I] we show the correspond-
ing bias in €{4() due to different feedback scenarios and
nonlinear matter power spectrum models. We also show
the first three PCs constructed from the remaining 397
ANTILLES simulations.

We derive the PC amplitudes Q; for ANTILLES and
other simulations used in [48] and show the distribution
of Qi-Q2 in Fig. We note that the value of Q; is
survey-dependent since PCs are calculated from preci-
sion matrix-weighted data vectors. Therefore, Q; in this
work can not be compared to the ones in
We define the wide prior of Q, as a uniform distribu-
tion between {[—20, 20], and explore a more informative,
baryon mass fraction-based prior in Sec. [ITB]

B. Calibrating baryonic feedback from baryon
mass fraction observations

Several publications [56] [76}{78] [96] have demon-
strated that small-scale suppression of the matter power
spectrum can be predicted from the baryon mass frac-
tion. In order to include corresponding measurements
of the baryon mass fraction in our analyses, we first de-
rive a relation between the mean normalized baryon mass
fraction within 101° to 104 Mo halos and our PCA am-
plitude parameters Q;.

We note that although we do not have the baryon mass
fraction measurement of the other 11 hydrodynamical
simulations, a similar relation between baryon mass frac-

found in [76]. At a fixed scale, P(k) suppression is pro-
ortional to Q1, and we expect other simulations to fol-
ow a similar Y,-Q; trend. Given that both the PCs
and Y,, are measured from ANTILLES, our method is
self-contained, and exploring this method on a larger het-
erogeneous simulation library is beyond the scope of this
aper.

stellar mass fraction, and we only aim to show the impact
qualitatively.

IV. MACHINE LEARNING ACCELERATED
INFERENCE

Due to the increased constraining power of the planned
analysis, we conduct an extensive study of the impact of
a variety of systematics (and their cross-talks). In order
to complete these studies in finite time, we train a neural
network emulator to evaluate the 6 x 2pt model vector
as a function of cosmological and nuisance parameters.
This strategy has been developed in [55} [59] {97+
{100}. Below we detail calculations of model vector and
covariances and describe the setup and accuracy of our
neural network emulator.

A. Theory models, covariances -
Cobaya-CosmoLike Architecture

We adopt the CoCoA inference pipeline for
likelihood analyses and validate our pipeline against the
public DES Y3 3 x 2 analysis and Planck PR4 CMB
lensing analysis [62] [72] [106] also see Appendix

1. Data vector modeling

five position-space correlation functions as:

lensing and primary CMB power spectra precomputed
at FFP10 cosmology, and C7 is the estimated primary
CMB power spectra.

2. Covariance modeling

The covariance matrix of the 6 x 2pt likelihood is evalu-

ated using CosmoCov [103] [105] [107] [108] following
and includes corrections from survey geometry. The co-
variance matrix is analytical except for the CMB lens-
ing auto-covariance, for which we adopt the numerical
covariance from [72] to marginalize over uncertainties
from the primary CMB power spectra and other intri-
cacies in CMB lensing reconstruction. Uncertainties re-
lated to survey systematics in galaxy clustering measure-
ments [64], point mass marginalization [TO09}I11] are also
accounted for in the covariance.
The covariance matrix is generated at a
fiducial ACDM with (Qn, 08, ns, Qn, Ho) =
(0.318, 0.744, 0.871, 0.040, 0.678). We adopt the survey
area Q, = 4143.2 deg, and a single-component shape
noise of a, = (0.243, 0.262, 0.259, 0.301) for each tomog-
raphy bin. When calculating the covariance, we fix linear
galaxy bias to (1.448, 1.666, 1.860, 1.756, 1.924, 1.865)
and lens galaxy magnification bias to
(0.430, 0.300, 1.750, 1.940, 1.560, 2.960). We calcu-
late the covariance matrix in curved-sky geometry,
assuming the Limber approximation. When evaluating
the covariance matrix blocks related with C7*, we sum
over L € [8, 2500}.

B. Neural network details and performance
1. Architecture

We adopt a similar neural network architecture as de-
veloped in (see Fig. 4). We train one of these neu-
ral networks for each of ie six two-point statistics in
our data vector {€4°(0), 7f?(V), we,(0), w3,.(0), we, (8),
Cc Fey independently. We. te the input parameters
into fast and slow parameters. Fast parameters, includ-
ing shear calibration bias and baryonic feedback PC am-
plitude, do not require complex calculations. Their im-
pact can be instantly applied to the model vector. Slow
parameters, including cosmological parameters, photo-z
bias and stretch, linear galaxy bias, [A amplitude and
redshift evolution, involve complex calculations. There-
fore, we only train emulators in the slow parameter space
and apply the fast parameters to the emulator prediction
on the fly.

For each emulator, cosmological and nuisance param-
eters are masked, normalized, and fed into an input
affine linear layer of Nreduced x 256, where Nyeduced js

evant to this probe. For example, the €4°(Y) emulator

rameters are passed into the input layer of size Nze4¥ced x 256,
which applies a linear affine transform to the input data.
Three 256 x 256 residual networks (RESMLP) layers are ap-
pended to the input layer, each consisting of two dense layers
with a residual connection. Then the 256 x Nzeduced output
layer is appended to the RESMLP layers to predict a specific
probe in 6 x 2pt.

4 photo-z bias parameters, and 2 NLA parameters. The
input layer is followed by three 256 x 256 multi-layer per-
ceptron (MLP) with residual connection (RESMLP), and
then a linear output layer of 256 x Nredvced Predictions
from the emulators are then post-processed and concate-
nated to return the full model vector for any given anal-

ysis.

2. Training

We follow [61] in generating the training and validation
samples. We first run a synthetic 6 x 2pt analysis on mock
data and calculate the parameter covariance. We temper
the parameter covariance C by a temperature T = 12g]
such that C ++ TC, and generate 1 million training data
by sampling the tempered covariance. The validation
data, which contains 10,000 samples, is generated from
the same covariance but with a temperature of T = 64.
We remove data points with Ay? > 10° compared to the
fiducial data vector to stabilize the training. We note
that T = 128 is a temperature large enough such that the

11 We abbreviate the emulator neural network model trained by
T = 128 data as RESMLP128 hereafter.

emulator is accurate over the posterior of €(¥), 3 x 2pt,
c3 x 2pt, and 6 x 2pt analyses.

During training, the input cosmological and nuisance
parameters are first masked and standardized, ensuring
that only relevant parameters are passed to the input
layer, and the parameters have a zero mean and unit
standard deviation. The data vectors y are also stan-
dardized to y as

Ut: (y= yaa)

y=
where U is the eigenbasis of the covariance matrix C and
yga is the fiducial data vector.
We use generalized Swish activation function [112] for
the RESMLP layers

l-y¥
where 6 and 7 are trainable parameters.

The loss function L(w) is a hyperbola of Ax? between
the training data produced by COCOA ycocoa and the
neural network prediction yyn

Ax? = (Ycocoa — Yn)” * C7: (Yoocoa — YNN)>

L(w) = (\/1 + 2Ax2) = 1,
(15)

where w is a vector of all trainable parameters, and ()
means sample average. We use the ADAM optimizer [113]
with an adaptive learning rate to train the network. We
use the L?-norm of the model weights to penalize overfit-
ting, and the L? penalty is controlled by a weight decay
of 10-8. We choose a batch size of 256 and train 200
epochs for each emulator. The learning rate starts from
10~° and is reduced by a factor of 10 when validation
loss plateaus for 10 epochs.

3. Validation

Our first validation metric is to evaluate the Ax? be-
tween the 6 x 2pt data vectors predicted by COCOA and
ReSMLP128 over the validation sample. The result is
shown in Fig.[5| We only see a 3.06 percent probability
for Ax? > 0.2, which is the theoretical error threshold
adopted by DES Y3 without importance sampling cor-
rection.

We also compare posteriors sampled by MCMC chains
run by CoCoA and RESMLP 128 using the fiducial cos-
mology with three baryonic feedback scenarios as input:
gravity only, Eagle, and Ilustris. We include all the data
points in €4(7) down to 0.'25 and adopt the baseline
scale cut for all the other probes. Posteriors are shown
in Fig. [jand show excellent agreement of contours when
using the emulator versus the brute force calculation.

We conclude that our emulator is reliable for the subse-
quent impact studies, mock analyses, and analysis choice
decisions.

V. ANALYSIS CHOICES AND SIMULATED
ANALYSES

A. Systematics models

We follow {5} [106] for systematics modeling in shear
calibration bias, photo-z uncertainty, linear galaxy bias,
point-mass marginalization, and magnification bias. The
baryonic feedback mitigation method, including exter-
nal prior from baryon mass fraction observation, is dis-
cussed in Sec. [ITI] Thus, we only discuss the remain-
ing systematic modeling that differs from the DES Y3
Key Project [106] in this section, including IA mod-
els (Sec. , point-spread function (PSF) uncertain-
ties and nonlinear matter power spectrum model-
ing (Sec./V A 3). Our baseline analysis settings, including
parameter spaces and corresponding priors, are summa-

rized in Table [II]

TABLE II. This table summarizes the prior ranges used in
both the synthetic and real analyses and the fiducial parame-
ter values used in synthetic analyses. We express a flat prior
as flat{min, max] and a Gaussian prior as N(j,0) where
N means normal distribution, 4 is the mean, and @ is the
standard deviation. We choose a narrow prior for neutrino
mass to avoid projection effect. Six fiducial baryonic feed-
back scenarios are adopted in our synthetic analyses: gravity-
only, Eagle, Illustris, ANTILLES-1 (strong), ANTILLES-
100 (mean), and ANTILLES-379 (weak). Q2 is fixed in our
baseline analysis and is sampled with a flat prior [—20, 20]
during the impact study. We note that we only use the first
four tomography bins of the MAGLIM sample, so we omit the
nuisance parameters of the last two bins.

1. Intrinsic alignment (IA)

Recent work [114] found that large-scale IA is mostly
due to the alignment of red central galaxies. At small
scales, the IA contamination is heavily influenced by
satellite galaxy alignment in the 1-halo regime, and this
satellite alignment becomes increasingly significant to-
wards lower redshifts. Among the new data points we
introduce in this work compared to the baseline DES Y3
3 x 2pt analyses, ws,(W) is impacted by the relatively
large-scale red central galaxy IA, which can be well de-
scribed by the nonlinear alignment model [see [117].
Compared to wyx(¥), the small-scale €4 (0) receives more
contamination from satellite alignment, which can not be
well described by the NLA model.

However, we do not expect the tidal alignment and
idal torquing model [TATT, [118] to outperform NLA
in small-scale €,(W) IA modeling. Recent analyses [119}
that compare Effective Field Theory (EFT) of IA
and halo alignment in N-body simulations find that
he TATT model starts breaking down at scales k >
0.05 h/Mpe [see [122] for a review]. Therefore, we con-
inue to use NLA as our baseline model to mitigate IA
in this work and sample both the IA amplitude Ay, and
he redshift evolution power index na with a flat prior
between [—5, 5]. This choice has been adopted in vari-
ous DES Y3 re-analyses [e.g. {16} [17] [38) [44 (971 [123] [124].
We discuss the impact of using TATT instead of NLA in
Sec.

2. Point spread function (PSF) bias

Imperfect PSF subtraction leads to residual PSF ellip-
ticity in the galaxy shape measurement, which translates
into biases of €(%). The best-fitting PSF contamination
d€R5F (9) from DES Y3 shows increasing bias towards
smaller scales [9] [69] [125] [126]. Given the increased con-
straining power of our 6 x 2pt analysis, we revisit the
bias introduced by PSF contamination in this paper, es-
pecially since we are including €,(¥) data points below
the standard DES Y3 scale cut.

The estimated shear of galaxies yes; can be contami-
nated by imperfect PSF modeling deg, and is expressed

sys

Mest = + SERS. + eM, (16)

where de"°* is measurement noise and (de"**) is ex-

pected to be zero. We note that ‘est has accounted for
the shear response of METACALIBRATION (125). The
PSF shear bias term is further decomposed into three

contributions [127] [128]

*

(7)
where a, 6, 7 are free coefficients per tomography bin,
Emodel ANd Tmodei are the predicted PSF ellipticity and
size from PIFF (29, e, and T, are the true PSF el-
lipticity and size. For simplicity, we abbreviate those
contributions as p = €model; @ = Cx — Cmodel, and
w = e,(Tx — Toaei)/Tx. Assuming that p, q, and w
do not correlate with cosmic shear and galaxy overden-
sity, the PSF residual only impacts €4(V) in the 6 x 2pt

where the so-called rho-statistics [128] [129] are defined
as po = (pp), pi = (44), p2 = (GP), p3 = (ww), pa
(w q), and p; = (wp). We note that each rho statistic
has a + and — component as cosmic shear.

Assuming p, g, and w are the same between galaxies
and stars, the rho statistics can be measured from stars.
The coefficients (a, 8, 7) of each tomography bin can be
measured by fitting the tau statistics

a(pp) + B(ap) + (wp),
a(pq) + B(qq) + 7(wa), (19)
a(pw) + B(qw) + (ww),

To. = (Yest P)
T2 = (Yest 7)
T5 = (Yest W)

using the rho statistics measured from stars. An estima-
tion of EGP PSF (9) can be derived given the best-fitting
coefficients.

We re-measure the tau- and rho-statistics and run
an MCMC chain to derive the best-fitting contami-
nation 6€25"(). We also calculate dé" +??(v),
which corresponds to the +2a-level contamination. The
d&4 >" + (9) is used to contaminate the mock data vec-

tors in Sec. [VB] for impact study and scale cut decision.

3. Nonlinear power spectrum

We adopt HALOFIT as our baseline nonlinear gravity-
only matter power spectrum model because of its robust-
ness over a large cosmological parameter space that is rel-
evant to this DES Y3 x Planck PR4 analysis and because
have shown that HALOFIT is sufficient for DES Y3
3 x 2pt analysis.

However, we re-assess the impact of Py, (k) model un-
certainties due to the inclusion of small-scale cosmic shear
data and the increased cosmological information from
CMB lensing and its cross-correlations.

We show the ratio between alternative Pyy(k) mod-
els (BACCOEMu, CosmicEMu, EucLIDEMU2, HM-
CopE2020) and the baseline HALOFIT prediction in
Fig. the black lines, where thick lines indicate the ra-
tio evaluated within the native k range and thin lines in-
dicate the ratio evaluated from cubic spline-extrapolation
of the corresponding Py, (k).

We see that different Pyi(k) models can have 10 per-
cent level difference at k > 10h/Mpc. Although baryonic
feedback generates a much stronger impact on Pyy,(k)
over this k range, a model mismatch in gravity-only
Pyx(k) can be absorbed by the baryonic feedback PCA
model and lead to biased estimation of feedback strength
Qi, which translates into biases in Sg, Qu.

Therefore, we conduct impact studies of the nonlin-
ear matter power spectrum, and its crosstalk with other

Ss

systematics, by generating mock data vectors with Eu-
CLIDEMU2 [94] and analyzing them using HALOFIT.

B. Scale cuts and validation

We include all cosmic shear data points down to 2./5
in this work. We impose the same scale cuts as [106]
in galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering (linear
galaxy bias). [3] includes small-scale data points in
galaxy-CMB lensing and shear-CMB lensing, which is
enabled by the high-fidelity CMB lensing reconstruction
from Planck and SPT [131]. We choose a conservative
scale cut in CMB lensing cross-correlations due to the
low angular resolution of Planck PR4 CMB lensing re-
construction.

The angular le cut of wy,.(V) is derived from Rmin =

6 Mpc/h, which is the same as y??(9) in DES Y3 [63] {130}.
This is a more conservative choice than [131] which
adopts Rmin = 3.5Mpc/h. The angular scale cut of
Wsx() is determined by the Gaussian beam size we ap-
plied to the Planck PR4 convergence field. We truncate
Wsx(V) at 14 arcmin, which is two times the full-width
at half maximum of the Gaussian beam. We include all
Cf* data points in [72].
We validate our analysis choice by running hundreds of
mock analyses using the emulator we trained in Sec.
Specifically, we consider the robustness of our pipeline
and analysis choices against three modeling uncertainties:
baryonic feedback modeling, PSF contamination model-
ing, and nonlinear matter power spectrum modeling.

As a metric we require that both the 2D bias in Qy-
Sg and the 1D bias in Q; are lower than 0.30, 0.30 x
V2 = 0.420, and 0.30 x V3 & 0.520 when 1, 2, and
3 systematics mentioned above are included in the data
vector. These thresholds were set before the simulated
likelihood analyses were conducted.

We show the Qm-Sg bias (top panel) and the Q,
bias (lower panel) in Fig. [7 We generate data vectors
for six baryonic feedback scenarios: gravity-only, Eagle-
like, Ilustris-like, ANTILLES-strong-like, ANTILLES-
mean-like, and ANTILLES-weak-like contamination.

In all cases, the biases in Q,,-Sg and Q, are below our
threshold, although we note that when three systematics
are included, the crosstalk between different systemat-
ics increases the resulting biases considerably. Not un-
expectedly, we observe borderline concerning biases for
cases that include both baryonic feedback and nonlinear
power spectrum modeling uncertainties.

The biases in Q-Sg and Q; for mock ANTILLES-
strong and ANTILLES-weak data vectors with PSF
contamination and Py,(k) from EUCLIDEMU2 included
are almost surpassing our error budget. This calls for a
more precise and robust systematics mitigation method
when pushing to smaller scales or when analyzing future,
more constraining datasets.

In Fig. I} we show the 2D (Q,-Ss bias similar to Fig. [7]
but consider the case of an additional Q, prior from Y,

11

(as we discussed in Sec. . In this case, we only con-
sider the three baryonic feedback scenarios for which we
can calculate the mean baryon mass fraction in halos of
mass between 10!° and 10!4 M5: ANTILLES-strong,
ANTILLES-mean, and ANTILLES-weak. For each of
them, we include a Yj,-based lognormal Q, prior centered
on their measured Y, with a standard deviation consis-
tent with equation [8]

Comparing Fig. |8] to Fig. we find that biases of
ANTILLES-strong and ANTILLES-weak are reduced
when the Y,-based prior is included. This can be ex-
plained by the fact that crosstalk between the nonlinear
matter power spectrum, PSF contamination, and bary-
onic feedback is limited by the tight Q, prior.

The only exception is ANTILLES-mean, whose biases
increase due to a biased Q prior. We note that the
ANTILLES-mean scenario deviates from the best-fitting
Q1-Y>p relation more than the average, hence we consider
it to be a stress test for our ¥,-based prior method.

We conclude that the Y;,-based Q, prior methodology
is robust to model misspecification even for the most con-
straining case of a 6 x 2pt analysis.

VI. COSMOLOGY RESULTS
A. Blinding strategy

Our blinding strategy follows that of [X24] We first:
validate our COCOA pipeline by separately reproducing
the DES Y3 MAGLI 3 x 2pt result [9} [62] [106] and the
Planck PR4 CMB lensing result [72] (see Appendix[A] for
more details).

Real data are only analyzed after successful code com-
parison, running all simulated likelihood analyses, and
after finalizing all analysis choices.

Chains of real data are analyzed after passing the
R—1 < 0.02 criterion, where R is the Gelman-Rubin
diagnostic. Analyses on real data are also blinded at
the posterior level; i.e., our analysis routine only displays
posteriors without axis values during blinded analyses.

Our blinding strategy has three unblinding criteria:

1. We conduct consistency tests among different data
vector partitions and analysis choices by requir-
ing the 2D marginalized Qm-Ss bias lower than
30. The internal consistency analysis routine is de-
signed to test the consistency without disclosing
any cosmological parameter values.

2. For the goodness-of-fit, we compute the reduced
x7/v of the best-fitting point (v is the d.o.f.).
We require the probability-to-exceed > 0.01 given

2
x°/v.

3. We visually check that the maxima of the nui-
sance parameter posteriors are not located near

show the corresponding results in Fig. i) and Table
Different data vector partitions are consistent with each
other, and therefore, we are allowed to combine them into
6 x 2pt probes.

We show the posteriors on Q, Sg, and Q; from differ-
ent data vector partitions in our baseline analysis with
the wide Q, prior in Fig. [9] When including the €4(0)
data down to 2.'5 and mitigating baryonic feedback with
PCA, we derive constraints on Sg = 0.793 + 0.016 from

DESI DR2 BAO+BBN. We show the 1D marginalized constraints on Ss,

3 x 2pt and Sg = 0.805 + 0.012 from 6 x 2pt. We note
that the Sg value and error bar are consistent with [3],
where the authors discard small-scale (9) by adopting
the standard DES Y3 scale cut. However, we note that
[3] utilizes a new CMB lensing convergence map recon-
structed from Planck and SPT jointly [131] and includes
small-scale wg, (0) and ws, (0). We conclude that includ-
ing small-scale (0) is beneficial

Another information from Fig. [9]is that the constraint
on Q; from 6 x 2pt alone (the filled blue contour) is con-
sistent with the prediction from based on the Q,-
Y, relation (the gray shaded region). Therefore, we are
allowed to combine the 6 x 2pt likelihood with the Qi
prior from [57]. This leads to a significant improvement
on Sg = 0.8073 + 0.0094, as shown in Fig. ig] (the purple
filled contour).

We also consider the impact of an alternative Yj, con-
straint motivated by the eROSITA survey [39], which
finds a lower gas mass fraction fgas than [57]. We note

s calibrated from ANTILLES Y, mea-
surement that includes consistent intracluster light and
brightest cluster galaxy mass modeling as [57], which
is not available for the GAMA group sample in [39).
Therefore, a rigorous comparison is beyond the scope
of this work, and we only estimate the impact of the
ower fgas found in [39] assuming a stellar mass frac-
‘ion from [57J. We evaluate feas (the mean gas fraction
within [10'3, 10!4] Mo halo mass) of random realizations
of the fas — My relation, which are drawn following equa-
‘ion (4) for [57], or their equation (4) for [39]. We report
feas to be 0.0510 + 0.0084 for and 0.0427 0035
for [39], i.e., around 0.90 discrepancy (see Fig. [3). This
A Frese translates to a change in baryon mass fraction
Alog [fo/(Qb/Qm)| * —0.048, which is within our er-
ror budget in equation (5). Including this A fzas leads to
Sg = 0.8099 + 0.0096.

C. Including primary CMB and geometric probes

Similar to [X24] we also consider two sets of external
cosmological priors:

1. Pl: Planck PR3+ACT DR6 Primary CMB TT-
TEEE Power Spectra [i.e. the P-ACT likelihood in
{15]. We are particularly interested in assessing the
ension between our 6 x 2pt result and the primary
CMB result. We note that the P-ACT likelihood
1as a derived Sg = 0.830 + 0.014.

2. P2: DESI DR2 BAO and Big Bang Nucleosynthe-
sis (BBN) [132]. We are interested in this prior
as it is geometrical and provides complementary
constraints on the expansion history of the Uni-
verse. We use the full sample BAO, including the
Bright Galaxy Sample, three Luminous Red Galax-
ies samples, two Emission Line Galaxies samples,
he QSO sample, and the Lya forest sample. The

BBN prior is from [133] [134] and tightly constrain
Qyh? = 0.02218 + 0.00055. Combining the DESI
DR2 BAO and BBN leads to Q, = 0.2977 £0.0086
and Ho = 68.51 + 0.58. Supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) re-
sults show 1.7 — 2.90 inconsistency in Qm with the
DESI DR2 BAO+BBN in ACDM, and we do no
include them in P2.

We compare the two external priors with our baseline
result (6 x 2pt with Yj, prior) in the left panel of Fig.
as well as the joint DES Y3 and Planck/SPT 6 x 2p
analysis [4]. [4] is different from our analysis in [A mod-
eling, baryonic feedback mitigation, data vector scale cut,
CMB lensing convergence map, covariance modeling, etc.
Fig. [10|shows that we obtain lower ,, and higher Sg, but
overall, the consistency is good within 0.68¢2p in Qm-Ss-

We find good consistency between our baseline resul
and both Pl and P2 external priors. In particular, the
1D Sx marginalized results from our baseline analysis and
P-ACT are consistent at 1.350. We evaluate the tension

cosmological parameters that corresponds to the EUCLIDEMU2 training dataset range for fair comparison between HALOFIT

nificantly (1.1 percent) compared to 6 x 2pt results (6.2
ercent). The constraining power on Sg saturates with
he inclusion of P1 and P2, and adding Yj, prior does not
further improve.

D. Agreement/tensions and robustness tests

We assess the robustness of our results by running the
analysis with alternative analysis choices. We list the
considered alternative choices below, sorted by the cor-
responding systematics:

FIG. 13. Impact study of different IA models (NLA
and TATT) and nonlinear matter power spectra models
(Hatorit/HF and EvcLIDEMULATOR2/EE2). Note that all
the chains in this figure are marginalized over Q; with a wide
prior, and include a flat prior on cosmological parameters
where the EUCLIDEMULATOR2 is trained. We annotate the
1D marginalized Sg values in the figure legend. The differ-
ence in Q is negligible, therefore it is omitted in this figure.

e Baryonic feedback: other than including cosmic
shear down to 2./5 and sampling the first PC, we
also consider the DES Y3 ACDM-optimized £4(#)
scale cut, with (Y3-cut Q wide in the right panel
of Fig. 11) or without (¥3-cut Q = 0) marginal-
izing Q1.

e Intrinsic alignment: other than the baseline NLA
model, we also consider the TATT model [118]
as adopted in [106]. Particularly, we consider
TATT with cosmic shear down to 2.’5 with wide
Qi: prior (2.'5 Qiwide TATT) and TATT with the
DES Y3 scale cut and no baryonic feedback miti-
gation (¥Y3-cut Q, =0 TATT).

e PSF contamination: we subtract the best-fitting

PSF contamination GEPSE: PE ag) from the mea-
sured data vector as the alternative data vector

(subtract déyohP).

e Nonlinear matter power spectrum: other than the
baseline HALorir [87] [140] [147], we also consider
EUCLIDEMULATOR2 as our nonlinear P(k)
model. Note that EUCLIDEMULATOR2 is valid
within a specific parameter space, which is nar-
rower than our 6 x 2pt posterior along dimensions
of A, and n,. Therefore, we impose a flat prior to
both HALOFIT (HF NLA and HF TATT) and Emu-
CLIDEMULATOR2 (EE2 NLA and EE2 TATT) chains
when comparing between the two models.

We show the tension metric nz in the right panel of
Fig. We note that different analysis choices are con-
sistent with each other within 0.4¢, illustrating the ro-
bustness of our analysis.

We focus on the impact of baryonic feedbac
Comparing among 6 x 2pt analyses down to 2.'5 with wide
Q1 prior (filled blue), with the DES Y3 ACDM scale cut
and wide Q, prior (unfilled purple), and DES Y3 scale
cut with Q, fixed to 0 (unfilled brown), our analyses
are consistent among different baryonic feedback mitiga-
tion methods. This validates the DES Y3 ACDM scale
cut as it is immune to baryonic feedback, and extending
the analysis down to smaller scales in cosmic shear does
not improve the cosmology constraints further, unless an
informative prior on the baryonic feedback strength is
included from other observations like ff, or fgas, X-ray,
tSZ, kSZ, fast radio burst dispersion measure, etc [36}
8) 2 OS 5) OT OI.

Another message from Fig. [T2jis that, although we do
not find strong tension in Sg between our 6 x 2pt analysis
and the primary CMB, baryonic feedback alone does not
impact the Sg result significantly, and is unlikely to be
a solution to Sg tension. This is similar to part of the
conclusions of [143] [144], where the authors find bary-
onic feedback is not sufficient to resolve the Sg tension.
Fig. shows the impact of different IA and nonlinear
matter power spectra modeling on S-Q (we omit Qm
due to negligible impact). Compared to NLA, TATT
produces lower Sg and requires weaker feedback, and
HALOFIT produces lower Sg than EUCLIDEMULATOR2.
The impact of nonlinear P(k) on Q; is more subtle, with
EUCLIDEMULATOR2 requiring slightly stronger feedback.
The mild differences among different choices (0.26-0.510)
indicate that IA and nonlinear P(k) are equally impor-
tant as baryonic feedback in terms of Sg constraint. This
is consistent with [16] [21] [145], where the authors find
that intrinsic alignment, nonlinear matter power spec-
trum model, and nonlinear galaxy bias can impact the
Sg result to a level that is not negligible for Sg tension
studies.

Another factor that could bias our result is the depen-
dency of baryonic feedback on cosmology. Intuitively, in
a universe where halos are less concentrated, the bind-
ing energy is lower, and baryonic feedback can expel
gas more efficiently. With a higher mean baryon mass
fraction 9),/Q:,, supermassive black holes receive more
gas to fuel AGN feedback. This has been found in
many studies [49] [76] [78] L46}148]. [55) studies the bias
on cosmological parameter inference due to cosmology-
dependent baryonic feedback strength using the MAG-
NETICUM multi-cosmology Box3/HR simulation suite,
and finds that although the feedback strength correlates
strongly with Q,/OQm at fixed sub-grid recipe, the PCA-
based baryonic feedback mitigation method can recover
the fiducial Qy-Sg within 0.30 under almost all cosmolo-

17

gies. Other methods like HMCopDE20 could have 0.5¢
bias under some cosmologies.

VII. BARYONIC FEEDBACK RESULTS
A. Results from this work

We discuss the constraints on baryonic feedback
strength Q) (Fig. and the resulting suppression in
matter power spectrum (Fig. in this section. All the
3 x 2pt and 6 x 2pt analyses presented in this section (in-
cluding when combined with CMB or/and BAO priors)
include cosmic shear data points down to 2.’5 and adopt
the wide Q, prior in order to constrain baryonic feedback
strength independent from X-ray-based observation [57].
We show the 1D marginalized Q, constrains in Fig.
where we find Q; = oro 32% for the 3 x 2pt analysis
and Q; = 0.025*0'}3 for the 6 x 2pt analysis. Includ-
ing information from external cosmological probes yields
slightly stronger feedback: Q, = 0.043 +0.016 (6 x 2pt +
P-ACT), Qi = 0.028 + 0.023 (6 x 2pt + DESI DR2 BAO
+ BBN), and Q; = 0.038 + 0.016 (6 x 2pt + P-ACT +
DESI DR2 BAO + BBN). Although we obtain stronger
feedback when combined with external probes, the re-
sulting P(k) suppression remains weaker than that of,
for example, COWLS AGN T8.5, and analyses combining
with different external probes show excellent consistency
in Q; and Sx.
We also show the Q, of selected hydrodynamical sim-
ulations in Fig Compared to our previous DES Y1
x Planck PR3 6 x 2pt analysis [X24] which prefers mild
feedback scenarios like BAHAMAS T8.0 and cOWLS-
AGN T8.0, our analyses in this work prefer even weaker
feedback scenarios like BAHAMAS 1T7.6, BAHAMAS
T7.8, or TNG100. Our Q, results are consistent with
the prediction from [57], denoted as the vertical gray
band in Fig. Strong feedback scenarios like Illus-
tris (Qi = 0.095) and cCOWLS AGN T8.7 (Q; = 0.137)
are excluded at 2.90-3.60 and 4.50-6.20 levels, respec-
tively. Our tightest constraint, 6 x 2pt + P1 + P2, when
translated to the nonlinear matter power spectrum sup-
pression due to baryonic feedback at z = 0, indicates
~ 5 percent suppression around k = 1h/Mpc and ~ 10
percent suppression around k = 5h/Mpc, as shown in
For comparison, £4(2.'5) is this work is sen-
sitive to k © 0.04-0.06h/Mpce and £°() is sensitive to
k & 4-8h/Mpc. The small-scale constraint is extrapo-
lated from larger scales via the first PC.

BACCOEMu. The authors constrain the halo
mass scale at which halos lose half of their mass
logM, = 14.3843-60, which is the only baryonifica-
tion parameter [16] [50] that DES Y3 cosmic shear
data is sensitive to.

e Chen et al. only uses small-scale cosmic shear
data points, which are discarded in the main DES
Y3 cosmic shear analysis [9}[10]. The authors adopt

BACCOeEmut and constrain logM, = 14.12*9°S?
with an Qy-og prior from DES Y3 3 x 2pt and
other cosmological parameters fixed to Planck 2018
TTTEEE+lowE analysis [14].

e Terasawa et al. [26] extends the standard HSC
Y3 cosmic shear scale cut [12] down to 0.’28 and
adopt HMCobeE20 [35] to model the baryonic feed-
back. The baryonic feedback strength is controlled
by the temperature of AGN feedback Oagn =
logio(Taan/K), with a flat prior of flat[7.3, 8.3].

e Wright et al. [19] presents the KiDS Legacy Survey
analysis with HMCOoDE20 as the baryonic feedback
modeling code, and sample Oacn with flat prior

flat[7.3, 8.3].

e Anbajagane et al. uses the cosmic shear 2PCFs
measured from the Dark Energy Camera All Data
Everywhere (DECADE) project and DES Y3 to
constrain both cosmology and baryonic feedback.
The authors model baryonic feedback with BARY-
ONForGE [149], which adopts a halo-model formal-
ism similar to that of [35] [44]. BARYONFoRGE in-
cludes a variety of dark matter and baryon density
profiles, including profiles from BCemu [32] [51],
BACCO [49], and HMx [35]. We consider the con-
straints from BARYONFORGE with BCEMu profile
presented in [54].

e Dalal e¢ al. [43] applies the Dark Matter + Baryon
(DMB) model developed in [29] to the tSZ Y-M
relation measured from a tSZ-selected galaxy clus-
ters. The tSZ y signal is measured from ACT DR5,
and the hydrostatic mass is measured through weak

lensing from DES Y3. The authors then fix cosmol-

ogy to Planck [14] and sample DMB parameters,
rom which the matter power spectrum suppression
can be calculated.

e Pandey et al. conducts joint analysis of DES
Y3 cosmic shear 2PCF and cross-correlation be-
ween cosmic shear and tSZ y map from ACT DR6
and Planck [150]. The authors apply the frame-
work developed in [30] and constrain cosmological
and astrophysical parameters that control baryonic
eedback.

FIG. 16. Comparison between the P(k) suppression at z = 0 from different literature (see Sec. [VIIB). We show our 6 x 2pt
and 6 x 2pt + P1 + P2 results as the light blue and purple solid lines, with the shaded regions showing the lo error budget.
Results from the literature are shown as hatched regions, and the boundaries correspond to the 16th and 84th percentiles.

FLAMINGO simulations and sample the baryoni-
fication parameters.

Compilation of the power spectrum suppression from
the literature above and the result of our analysis are
shown in Fig. We sort the literature results so that
P(k) suppression from weak lensing-based analyses (left
panel), tSZ-based analyses (middle panel), and kSZ/X-
ray-based analyses (right panel) are shown separately.
We note that our constraints are generally well aligned
with the weak lensing-based results, although with mild
differences from [25] [54]. Analyses based on tSZ/kSZ/X-
ray generally prefer stronger feedback at k > 1h/Mpc.
We note that strong baryonic feedback is also found in
[36] [40} {153}.

[154] proposes a potential avenue to resolve this dif-
ference by examining the impact of baryonic feedback
rom a halo assembly perspective: while weak lensing,
SZ, kSZ, and X-ray observations are sensitive to differ-
ent scales and redshift, the efficiency of baryonic feedback
is also a function of halo mass, radial scale, and redshift.
Massive halos (which weak lensing, tSZ, and X-ray are
sensitive to) are impacted by baryonic feedback early,
ut are affected less, and re-accrete the ejected matter at
ower redshifts due to their deep gravity potential. Cos-
mological probes sensitive to massive halos at different
redshifts may capture different feedback strengths dur-
ing halo assembly. Feedback in less massive halos (which
kSZ is sensitive to) starts at lower redshifts, but can ef-
ficiently move gas outside of halos and maintain strong
eedback suppression. However, this simple explanation
has difficulty in explaining the strong feedback found in
[44], which is sensitive to massive halos, and the con-

sistency between the DES Y3 shear-only result and the
shear+kSZ result in [38]. Also, the halo mass and redshift
range of kSZ measurements overlap with the HSC-XXL
X-ray sample considerably, but the kSZ prefers much
stronger feedback than the HSC-XXL sample[45] [144].
Therefore, it is possible that there are unknown system-
atics in some of these measurements that produce the
differences in feedback strength measured by different
probes. More powerful data (e.g. DES Y6, LSST Y1, and
Simons Observatory) are required to draw a solid conclu-
sion on P(k) suppression measured by different probes.

examines popular analytical models for baryonic
feedback [31] [35] [51] [53] and finds that, although those
models can fit the matter-matter, matter-pressure, and
electron density-electron density power spectra with high
accuracy, their prediction on halo properties (e.g., bound
gas fraction, electron pressure, temperature, and den-
sity profiles) varies considerably. This indicates that the
current baryonic feedback models need further refine-
ment to model weak lensing and astrophysical probes
consistently. Another recent analysis [54] investigates
the best-fitting feedback-induced P(k) suppression with
the DECADE weak lensing data. The authors consider
BCEmu, BACCOEMu, HMx, and BARYONFORGE, and
find that astrophysical and cosmological (e.g. 0/Qm)
priors explicitly or implicitly assumed in the analysis can
impact the P(k) suppression by a couple of percents, in-
dicating a nontrivial projection effect in P(k) suppression
analysis.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we constrain cosmology and baryonic
physics scenarios with a combination of weak lensing,
galaxy clustering, CMB lensing, and cross-correlations
using DES Year 3 and Planck PR4 datasets. Compared
to previous work 4)) we have significantly upgraded
our catalog-to-cosmology pipeline, specifically in three
different areas:

1. We improved our baryonic physics modeling by em-
ploying 400 ANTILLES hydrodynamical simula-
tions.

2. We derive a scaling relation between the bary-
onic feedback amplitude parameter Q; and the
mean baryon mass fraction in halos of Mso00 €
(1013, 10'4] Mo. This allows us to incorporate ex-
ternal information on baryonic physics into our
analysis.

3. We train a neural network emulator to run hun-
dreds of simulated analyses exploring the science
return as a function of analysis choices.

The latter is of particular importance for future science
analyses in this area. Our emulator generates 6 x 2pt
model vectors given input cosmological and nuisance pa-
rameters accurately over a large parameter space. This
accelerates our 6 x 2pt analysis runtime CPU hours by
more than a factor of 10°, allowing us to quickly explore
different analysis choices and conduct impact studies for
various systematics and their permutations. This ability
not only reduces the carbon footprint of our analysis but
also ensures the robustness of the pipeline and analysis
choices before applying it to real data.

We studied the impact of three systematics specifically:
baryonic feedback, PSF contamination, and nonlinear
matter power spectrum model mismatch. We conclude
hat, at the precision of the DES Y3 x Planck PR4 CMB
ensing 6 x 2pt analysis, all systematics are controlled
within the previously defined error budget. However, our
analysis suggests that a more accurate and robust sys-
tematics mitigation method is essential for future DES
Y6 6 x 2pt analyses, in particular when pushing €+(#)
below 2.'5.

After an extensive suite of synthetic analyses, we ob-
ained competitive results on Sg from our 6 x 2pt analy-
sis, Sg = 0.8073 + 0.0094 when including the information
from [57]. Our result is consistent with [3].

Our 6 x 2pt is consistent with both the primary CMB
TTTEEE spectra from Planck PR3 and ACT DR6 (P-
ACT, external prior P1) and the DESI DR2 BAO and
BBN (external prior P2). Combined our 6 x 2pt analysis

20

with Pl and P2 tightly constrain Sg = 0.8079 + 0.0073
and OQ, = 0.2995 + 0.0034.

We quantify small-scale matter power suppression due
to baryonic feedback via the amplitude of the first prin-
cipal component @, in our analysis. We find a prefer-
ence for weak feedback scenarios (Qi = 0.025%9'999 for
6x 2pt and Q; = 0.038+0.016 for 6x 2pt+P1+P2), which
is in strong disagreement with the feedback scenarios of
OWLS AGN T8.7 or Illustris simulations. When com-
bined with Pl and P2, we find ~ 5 percent suppression
around k © 1h/Mpc and ~ 10 percent suppression at
k = 5h/Mpc.

This result is consistent with other weak lensing-based
constraints on the small-scale power suppression, but
generally weaker than results from tSZ/kSZ/X-ray-based
analyses.

Several possible extensions of this work are worth men-
tioning. On the data side, the near-future DES Year
6 and slightly later LSST Year 1 data are fascinating
prospects. On the CMB side, the ACT DR6 dataset ex-
ists already, and near-future data from the Simons Obser-
vatory poses an exciting opportunity. On the methodol-
ogy side, the rapidly evolving COCOA pipeline has fully
adopted the machine-learning-accelerated inference con-
cept, which will be even more important as the model
space expands beyond ACDM and into more complex
systematics parameterizations.
