Abstract

Negatively charged silicon vacancy centers (SiV~) in diamond exhibit excellent spin coherence
and optical properties, making them promising candidates for quantum technologies. However,
he strain-induced inhomogeneous distribution of optical transition frequencies poses a challenge
or scalability. We demonstrate electrical tuning of the SiV~ center zero-phonon lines using in-
plane contacts to apply moderate electric fields up to 45 MV/m. The second-order Stark shift
exceeds 10 GHz, which is of the same order of magnitude as the 15 GHz inhomogeneous distribu-
ion of SiV~ observed in emitters embedded in optical nanostructures such as photonic crystal

nanocavities. Analysis of individual SiV~ centers shows significant variation in polarizabilities be-

ween defects indicating that the polarizability strongly depends on local parameters like strain.
The observed polarizabilities are ~3-25 times larger than those of tin vacancy centers, which we
attribute to valence band resonances that delocalize the e,, wavefunctions. Photoluminescence
excitation measurements reveal that optical linewidths increase moderately with applied electric
field strength. Our results demonstrate that large electrical Stark shifts can overcome the inho-
mogeneous distribution of transition frequencies, representing a significant step toward scalable

SiV~-based quantum technologies such as quantum repeaters.

I. INTRODUCTION

Many quantum technologies require long coherence times for their quantum memories
and efficient optical interfaces to send information over long distances [I] [2]. In this context,
color centers in diamond are promising spin memories and spin-photon interfaces and have
already been integrated into electrical and optical nanostructures [3} [4]. In particular, the
inversion-symmetric group-IV vacancies in diamond, including silicon, germanium and tin
vacancies, have excellent optical properties such as near-transform-limited zero-phonon lines
[5], electron spin coherence times up to milliseconds [6] [7] and nuclear spin coherence times
exceeding seconds [8]. Due to local strain and Coulomb fields caused by other defects in
the crystal, the emission wavelength can vary slightly between emitters, making emitted
photons distinguishable. Specifically, the inhomogeneous distribution of optical emission
frequencies lies in the range of 15 GHz for implanted SiV~ incorporated into nanostructures,

even after careful annealing [9]. Overcoming this inhomogeneous distribution of optical
emission frequencies is a practical challenge when building systems with multiple optically
interfaced color centers.

Currently, different strategies are under investigation for making emitted photons in-
distinguishable: 1) When converting distinguishable SiV~ photons to telecom frequencies,
the target wavelength can be precisely tuned by adjusting the frequency of the pump laser
used in the nonlinear frequency conversion process individually for each emitter [4J [10]. 2)
Strain can change the optical transition frequency and can be applied locally using advanced
nanostructures such as electrically tunable cantilevers [1114]. 3) Electric fields can tune
the optical emission frequency via the DC Stark effect, an approach that has already been
demonstrated for nitrogen and tin vacancy centers [[5}{19}.

Here, we investigate Stark tuning of SiV~ centers, which provides straightforward elec-
trical tunability with simple electrode structures. Our results show that the polarizability
is 3-25 times larger for silicon vacancies compared to tin vacancies [I7}19]. Due to our
relatively large 7.6m electrode spacing, the applied electric fields are far from the limit
posed by electrical breakdown in vacuum. Our finding that we can tune optical emission
frequencies by multiple GHz even with these moderate electric fields relaxes the constraints

on nanostructure fabrication for overcoming inhomogeneous optical emission frequencies.

II. RESULTS

Figure[l]a) depicts the simplified energy level diagram of SiV~ in the absence of external

magnetic fields [20) [21]. The ground states

Ey,1/2) and |£4.3/2) are split by approximately
50 GHz due to spin-orbit coupling and the Jahn-Teller effect, a splitting that can increase
with strain. These states are defined by the occupation of the energy levels e, and e,. The
states e,, are close to the valence band maximum, while the energetically higher-lying states

ég are within the bandgap. In the ground states | £,1/2) and |E,.3/2) of the SiV_, the orbitals

€,, are filled entirely with 4 electrons, while there are 3 electrons or effectively a single hole

in eg. For the excited states

Eu3/2) and |£y3/2), the situation is reversed, meaning that
there is a hole in the e, levels [20]. The excited states are split by at least 250 GHz and their
splitting can also increase with strain. The energy of the orbital states shift with electric
field as a consequence of the DC Stark effect [22]. Due to the inversion symmetry of the

atomic arrangement of a silicon vacancy complex [20] [23], all SiV~ states are associated with

Top-view schematic of the relevant parts of the sample showing two thin Ti/Au electrodes on flat
bulk diamond. The electrode distance is 7.6 zm and we ground one of the electrodes and apply a
voltage to the other. We focus the excitation and detection spot at approximately a quarter of the
electrode distance from one of the electrodes. This breaks the symmetry in voltage because the
photocurrent is stronger when the electrode closer to the excitation spot is positively biased. The
small black spots El, E2, E3 and E4 schematically mark different studied single SiV~ positions
along the electrode edges. The grey spots mark other single SiV~, which we did not select. c)
Photoluminescence excitation spectra of the emitter labelled E4, transition C (denoted E4-C), for

voltage.
inversion-symmetric wavefunctions. This leads to a vanishing static electric dipole moment
and thus the absence of a first order Stark shift. However, the negatively charged electron
wavefunctions and positively charged nuclei can be polarized relative to each other by an
applied electric field, leading to an induced electric dipole moment and a second-order shift
of the electronic states energies. Hence, no linear Stark shift is expected, but second order
Stark shifts can occur.

The Stark shift in the optical transition frequencies represents the difference of the Stark

shifts of the participating initial and final states. We describe the optical transition frequency
f(E) = finax — «(E — Ep)? (1)

and Stark shift
Af = F(E) = fmnax: (2)

as a function of a local applied electric field E. Here, fimax is the maximum optical transition
frequency, EF is the applied local electric field, Ep is the local electric field offset and a is
the effective polarizability of the transition frequency. The effective polarizability a is the
difference of polarizabilities of the two levels involved in the optical transition, where each
of those is a measure of the field-induced perturbation of the wavefunction.

In this study, we use interdigitated electrodes on a flat oxygen-terminated diamond surface

to apply an electric field to the silicon vacancies studied. Figure [1] b) shows a schematic
illustration of the electrodes and the measurement setting. The parallel electrode edges are
separated by 7.6m. One of the electrodes is grounded, while the positive and negative
contacts of the voltage source are floating to avoid ground loops. We position the focal
spots from the excitation and detection channels at a quarter of the electrode distance.
Since we keep this position distance constant, we have a constant conversion factor between
applied voltage and applied electric field, see details below. For all measurements, we cool
the sample to 5K in vacuum using a closed-cycle cryostat.

To estimate the local electric field experienced by the SiV centers for a given applied volt-
age, we simulate the system using the finite-element tool COMSOL and the Lorentz local
field approximation. Details on the COMSOL simulation can be found in the Supplemen-
tary Information. The Lorentz approximation accounts for the polarization of a medium

surrounding a color center, which effectively enhances the electric field at the defect site
[24]. The local electric field acting on the defect is then given by B = Ex.(e + 2)/3, where
Ext is the externally applied field obtained from the COMSOL simulations and ¢ is the
dielectric constant of diamond (¢ = 5.7) [[8]. For an emitter 100nm below the diamond
surface and located 1.9m (quarter of the electrode separation) from an electrode with an
applied voltage of 10 V, the simulation gives FE... = 0.82MVm7!. This yields a local field
E = 0.82 x (5.7 + 2)/3 = 2.10MVm-7!. The uncertainty in the external field, based on
assumed variations of the emitter position of 1.5 1m to 2.4m from the electrode, translates
to a 7% relative uncertainty in the local field estimation.

To locate SiV~ centers, we translate the laser spot parallel to the electrode edge and mea-

sure the photoluminescence (PL) using a blue or green laser with either 740 THz, 582 THz

or 564 THz optical frequency and an optical power of 0.5mW to 3mW for excitation. The
1/e? beam waist is approximately 600nm. A representative PL spectrum is displayed in
the supporting information in F igure [$1] For the given SiV~ density, we always find several
SiV~ centers per detection volume, but they can be readily isolated spectrally by resonantly
driving individual transitions.

To strongly increase the spectral resolution and thereby effectively work with single SiV—
centers, we measure PL excitation spectra in the following. For this, we scan the optical
frequency of a narrow-linewidth (< 2 MHz) wavelength-stabilized laser over the peaks of the
photoluminescence spectra. A 375 to 400 THz bandpass filter isolates the phonon sideband
emission while suppressing the excitation lasers. To detect the emitted single photons we
use single photon avalanche diodes or superconducting nanowire single photon detectors. To
stabilize the SiV in the negative state SiV—, we use an off-resonant low power green or blue
laser (again 740 THz, 582 THz or 564 THz optical frequency).

Figure |1|c) shows typical PL excitation spectra of an SiV~ center as a function of the
applied electric field. We clearly observe a PL peak shift due to the DC Stark effect. Each
spectrum is fitted using a Lorentzian to obtain the center frequency f(£), peak amplitude
and peak linewidth as a function of the applied electric field. The resulting field-dependent
data are presented in Figure [| a) confirming that the peak frequency shift Af is quadratic
in the applied voltage or electric field E. As discussed above, this is expected since SiV—
are inversion symmetric, leading to a vanishing linear contribution to the Stark shift. A
second order shift is also observed in the Stark tuning of tin vacancies (SnV~), which also

exhibit inversion symmetry [I7HI9]. The data presented in Figure |2|a) show two different

if
One of the two emitters (E8-C) shifts by 4GHz, while the other (E4-C) shifts by 14 GHz at
the same applied local electric field.

In an earlier work, we showed that a variation in the applied voltage changes the SiV
charge state [27]. This process is induced by negatively biasing the electrode nearest to the
SiV center, a procedure that promotes a transition to a dark state. Figure |2}b) shows the
PL intensity as a function of the applied field, exhibiting similar behavior as observed in
[27]: The peak practically vanishes when the nearest electrode is negatively biased and the
amplitude is highest for positive voltages between 50 and 100 V.

We continue to discuss the linewidth as a function of the applied field. From the literature,

we expect that the transform-limited full width at half maximum (FWHM) linewidth is
1/(27T) optical) = 90 MHz [26]. Figure [2] c) shows the fitted FWHM linewidths as a
function of the applied electric field. In the absence of an applied field, the linewidth
is approximately 400 MHz, increasing to values between 500 and 600 MHz towards high
applied fields. We expect that the additional line broadening is caused by a combination of
the increasing induced static dipole moment that makes the center more sensitive to charge
noise arising from current flow at higher applied voltages. Hence, the linewidth is expected
to decrease by lowering the photocurrent caused by the off-resonant laser that stabilizes the
SiV~ charge state, e.g. by using a pulse sequence.

We measured the PL voltage-dependent excitation spectra for 9 different emitters and
observe center-to-center statistical variations of Stark tuning parameters. Figure |3}a) sum-
marizes all peak center frequencies measured for transition C (defined in Figure |1) of all
centers and Figure [3] b) the equivalent data for transition D. Figure [S3] shows a plot of all
measured center frequencies plotted as a function of the applied local electric field. We clearly
observe a trend that the optical transition frequencies at zero applied field vary, resembling
the typical inhomogeneous distribution caused by locally varying strain and electric fields
induced by crystal defects [9]. The inhomogeneous distribution is < 10 GHz for both transi-
tions C and D. This is expected for annealed bulk diamond and somewhat smaller than the
inhomogeneous distribution of around 15 GHz achieved for SiV~ in optical nanostructures
[9].

Figure |3| c) shows the polarizability a as a function of the offset electric field Eo. The
measured SiV~ polarizabilites are significantly higher than those reported for tin vacancies

([7H{T9] and clearly vary between emitters. However, no direct correlation is observed be-

tween polarizability and zero-field frequency. The offset electric field Ep is always found to be
positive and non-zero. This observation indicates that the spatial symmetry along the axis
connecting the electrodes is broken. Furthermore, high polarizabilities occur preferentially

alongside high local electric offset fields Ep.
Ill. DISCUSSION

We observed center-to-center variations in polarizability and the local electric field offsets.
We attribute the different offset electric field Ep to the charged surroundings of individual SiV
centers, including the space-charge region caused by band-bending at the nearby electrode
and optical illumination [28], as well as the fluctuating charge environment caused by charged
defects in the vicinity of each SiV~. After identifying an emitter, we typically performed a
single measurement that included also negative voltages. However, the photoluminescence
excitation peak intensity was consistently found to be very weak below 0V or at least
—20V, consistent with our earlier work [27]. The exact voltage dependence varies between
emitters. Consequently, we measured primarily using positive voltages, potentially leading
to asymmetries in the charging behavior. This may also explain the exclusively positive
values of Eo, potentially since the optically induced space-charge region builds up slowly.
Charged defects close to the SiV~ can only explain the symmetry-breaking if they are a part

of the optically induced space-charge region.

Two aspects can explain the strong variation in the observed polarizabilities between
1.4(1) and 15.0(1) MHz/(MV/m)’: Firstly, locally varying properties such as strain and
Coulomb fields from charged defects near the SiV~ can deform the wavefunction, hence
altering the polarizability. It is known from literature that tin vacancies even show very
strong linear contributions to the Stark shift, attributed to strain [I7]. However, we do
not observe significant linear Stark shifts for our SiV~ emitters. Furthermore, strain may
influence the response of NV~ centers to electric fields [29], a mechanism that could also
translate to SiV. Secondly, the variation of the polarizabilities may be an artifact arising from
local electric fields that differ from the calculated values. This may arise due to screening of
the applied electric field by an optically induced space charge region. Indeed, a study with a
nitrogen-doped diamond found that space-charge regions built up during laser illumination
and that they could screen the applied fields altogether at least up to a few MV/m [28].

However, we believe that the variation here is mainly due to strain and local electric fields.

Our results indicate that large polarizabilities tend to occur alongside high offset electric

fields Ey. Since high Ep is caused by a strong space-charge screening of the applied electric

field, our data contrasts with the hypothesis that high polarizabilities are an artifact caused

by weaker screening. This leaves the hypothesis that locally varying properties such as strain

10
and the Coulomb fields of other charged defects lead to the variation in polarizabilities.
Further studies could measure all 4 optical transitions of each emitter, which would allow to
calculate the strain using the known Hamiltonian [I] and to directly correlate the measured
strain to the polarizability.

Each Stark shift that we measured can be fitted well by equation |l| in contrast to a
recent report where certain tin vacancies exhibited a very noticable linear contribution to
the Stark shift that was attributed to strong strain in the sample [17]. In addition to the
absence of a linear term, we note that higher order terms are not needed to fit the center
frequencies, since the second order fits describe the data very well. Data on the quadratic
fits of all measured individual Stark shifts can be found in Figure [54]in the Supplementary
Information.

We attribute the substantially higher polarizability of SiV~ compared to SnV~ to dif-
ferences in the confinement depths of the single-electron states. Density functional theory
(DFT) calculations reveal that the e, states of SiV~ are resonant with valence band max-
imum states and that they exhibit reduced localization [20]. This spatial delocalization
enhances their size and polarizability and contributes to the larger Stark shifts observed in
SiV~ centers. In contrast, the e, states lie deep within the bandgap, resulting in strong
localization and minimal contribution to the optical transition’s Stark shift.

For heavier group-[V atoms, DFT calculations reveal that the e, states move deeper
within the bandgap [21], explaining the reduced polarizability observed in SnV~ centers.
This systematic trend across group-IV vacancy centers provides fundamental insight into
the relationship between electronic structure and characteristic electro-optical responses.
An additional comparison can be made to the recently studied inversion-symmetric nickel
vacancy in diamond [30]. The polarizability of this center is also significantly lower than that
of the silicon vacancy and comparable to the polarizabilities of tin vacancies [17] [18]. This
is in agreement with our hypothesis above, as we do not expect one of the nickel vacancy

energy levels to be resonant to the band edge states.

IV. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

Our results demonstrate the potential for electrical tuning of SiV~ emission frequencies,

for example to obtain indistinguishable photons for quantum repeaters. We find tuning

11
ranges up to 15 GHz, which is in the same order of magnitude as the width if the inhomoge-
neous optical emission frequency distribution caused by strain [9]. We discuss the possibility
that the SiV~ polarizabilities are higher compared to those of tin or nickel vacancies because
the e, level of the SiV~ is resonant to valence band maximum states and thus more delo-
calized, making it weakly confined and more polarizable. Furthermore, our measurements
show the presence of offset local electric fields and provide insights about their origin and the
observed variations in the polarizability between different emitters. We attribute the offset
electric fields to an optically induced space charge region and the variations in polarizability
to local perturbations like strain and Coulomb fields of other defects.

Turning to possible directions for future investigations, higher applied fields should sig-
nificantly enhance the tuning range further and potentially allow frequency matching of
arbitrarily selected SiV~. Those higher fields could e.g. be realized by electrodes with
smaller separations of 1 to 4m. Significantly stronger electric fields could lead to charge
state instability, necessitating mitigation strategies for charge-state stabilization and charge-
induced decoherence. Rapid voltage modulation protocols, as demonstrated in our previous
work [27], could enable charge state initialization before Stark tuning, potentially extending
the accessible tuning range. Complete characterization of the Stark tensor through inde-
pendent control of electric fields in all spatial dimensions would provide a comprehensive
understanding of the electro-optical coupling. Finally, investigating the impact of rapidly
varying electric fields on excited state dynamics may reveal new opportunities for photon

shaping and quantum state manipulation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sample preparation

Silicon vacancy centers were created by implanting silicon into electronic grade, single-
crystal diamond produced by Element Six. Element Six grew the diamond using chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) and diced it into dimensions of 3mm x 3mm x 0.5mm. This grade
of diamond typically contains nitrogen and boron impurity levels below 5 ppb and 0.5 ppb,
respectively [3].

CuttingEdge Ions implanted ?8Si ions at 132 keV with an expected implantation depth of

12
100nm to 150nm and a dose of 5 x 10° ions/em~?. After implanatation, the samples were
annealed in multiple steps: 4h ramp to 400°C, 8h at 400°C, 12h ramp to 800°C, 8h at
800°C, 12h ramp to 1100°C, and 10h at 1100°C, all under high vacuum (< 1 x 1077 mbar)
[9]. During this process, the temperature is gradually incremented to maintain high vacuum
within the annealing chamber, essential for preventing surface graphitization of the diamond
,

The sample was cleaned sequentially in aqua regia (1h at 90°C) and concentrated sulfuric
acid (1h at 225°C), followed by oxygen plasma exposure to achieve oxygen termination. We
fabricated interdigitated electrodes with 7.6 pm spacing using optical lithography and metal
evaporation starting with 20 nm of titanium followed by 200 nm of gold. Each electrode con-
nects to 200m x 200 pm bond pads. Finally, we mounted the sample on a well-thermalized

copper plate and wire-bonded it to a custom-printed circuit board chip carrier.

Optical and electrical measurements

The sample was cooled to 5K using an attoDRY800 closed-cycle cryostat from attocube
systems AG. Electrical voltage was applied using a Keithley 2450 source-measure unit, which
also measured currents. Both the Keithley and half of the electrodes were grounded to the
cold base plate of the cryostat in a star-shaped configuration.

Optical measurements were performed using a custom-built confocal microscope setup.
Off-resonant excitation employed Toptica Photonics SE iBeam smart diode lasers with either
740 THz (405 nm) or 582 THz (515 nm) optical frequency or a Laser quantum LLC torus laser
with an optical frequency of 564 THz (532 nm).

For resonant excitation, we used a narrow-linewidth continuous-wave laser (C-Wave GTR
from Hiibner Photonics), wavelength-stabilized to a wavemeter with 60 MHz absolute accu-
racy and 2 MHz resolution (High Finesse WS7-60 IR-I). Power stabilization was achieved
using a software PID controller and analog modulation via a fast acousto-optic modulator
(15 ns rise time, driven at 350 MHz in the first diffraction order).

All excitation lasers were coupled into single-mode fibers for spatial mode filtering. Af
ter combining both excitation lasers with a free-space dichroic mirror, a 400 THz (750 nm)
frequency-long pass filter removed optical noise and fiber-induced Raman signal frequencies

from the excitation laser spectra. Laser focusing was accomplished using an f = 2.87 mm,

13
0.82 NA, low-temperature apochromatic objective (LT-APO/VISIR/0.82 from attocube sys-
tems AG).

Detection employed single-mode fiber-coupled avalanche photodiodes (APDs) with ap-
proximately 700Hz dark counts or superconducting single-photon detectors from Single
Quantum with < 1Hz dark counts. Three 400THz (750nm) frequency-short pass filters
and one 545 THz (550 nm) frequency-short pass filter separated the excitation laser from the
SiV~ phonon sideband signal. A 375 THz (800nm) frequency-long pass filter removed the
diamond Raman signal from the 407 THz (737 nm) resonant excitation laser, which appears

at 367 THz (816 nm).

Appendix A: Supplementary Information

Figure |[S1| shows a representative photoluminescence spectrum that we used to make an
initial estimation of the optical transition frequencies of the SiV-. We see the typical SiV~
spectrum with lines A, B, C and D as described in F igure[IJa). For the particular SiV~ mon-
itored here, the ground state splitting is 76 GHz and the excited state splitting is 273 GHz.
The spectrum shows more than these 4 lines and thereby indicates the presence of more
than just one single SiV~ center. The centers are also strained to varying degrees. We did
not attribute the other transitions for the sake of clarity of the figure. The SiV~ density in
the sample is too high to spatially resolve single SiV~ in confocal micro-photoluminescence
measurements. However, it is low enough to clearly distinguish different emitters spectrally
using confocal micro-photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy with high spectral resolu-

tion which we used for the measurements in the main text.

FIG. S1. Photoluminescence spectrum of SiV~, which used a 564THz (532nm) laser for
excitation and an f = 500mm spectrometer with a grating that has 1200 lines per millimeter for
detection. We assign lines A, B, C and D to one of the emitting SiV~. The fact that there are

more emission lines indicates that multiple SiV~ with varying degrees of strain contribute.

Figure |52| shows the results of the COMSOL simulation of the electric field components
E,, Ey, and the norm |E| as a function of the x-coordinate between two electrode fingers.

The applied voltage is 10 V and the field was calculated 100 nm below the surface, which is

18
the expected implantation depth. The electrode separation is 7.6 ;m and the electrodes are

10pm wide and 150 nm thick. Pure vacuum surrounds the diamond and the electrodes.

FIG. $2. COMSOL simulation of the static electric field. The field is calculated in the
diamond 100nm (resembling SiV~ implantation depth) below the surface along a line that runs
perpendicular to the edges of the electrode fingers. In the simulation, we applied 10 V to the right
gold electrode and grounded the left one. The electrode separation is 7.6 ym. The x-direction runs
parallel to the diamond surface between the electrodes. Positive y-direction is from the diamond
surface upwards into the vacuum. The dashed line indicates the approximate position of the SiV—

that we studied.

Figure[$3]displays the absolute peak center frequencies of all measured SiV~ as a function
of the applied voltage and applied local electric field. For emitter E4, we measured all 4
optical transitions. In Figure [$4] we present the Stark shifts Af for the same data, which
are the deviation from the maximum measured frequency finax- Note that the peaks shift to
lower transition frequencies. In addition to the change of transition frequency with applied
electric field, the peak amplitudes also change. This is caused by charge state conversion
[27]. At low and at elevated fields, this can lead to peak intensities in the noise floor, so

that we could not fit the peaks at these applied voltages.

FIG. $3. All measured peak center frequencies as a function of applied voltage and
applied local electric field. The center frequencies are clustered into 4 regions which correspond
to the 4 optical transitions allowed in SiV~ at zero magnetic field. The voltage range over which
peak fitting could be performed to determine center wavelengths varied between individual emitters,

reflecting voltage-dependent intensity variations arising from charge state conversion processes.

FIG. $4. Overview of all measured peak Stark shifts as a function of applied voltage
and applied local electric field. The polarizability of the second-order Stark tuning clearly
varies between emitters, with some of the emitters reaching Stark shifts of + 10 GHz while some

reach only a few GHz.
