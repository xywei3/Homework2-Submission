Abstract: While photonic lanterns efficiently and uniquely map a set of input modes to
single-mode outputs (or vice versa), the optical mode transfer matrix of any particular fabricated
device cannot be constrained at the design stage due to manufacturing imperfections. Accurate
knowledge of the mapping enables complex sensing or beam control applications that leverage
multimode conversion. In this work, we present a characterisation system to directly measure the
electric field from a photonic lantern using digital off-axis holography, following its evolution
over a 73 nm range near 1550 nm and in two orthogonal, linear polarisations. We provide the
first multi-wavelength, polarisation decomposed characterisation of the principal modes of a
photonic lantern. Performance of our testbed is validated on a single-mode fibre then harnessed
to characterise a 19-port, multicore fibre fed photonic lantern. We uncover the typical wavelength
scale at which the modal mapping evolves and measure the relative dispersion in the device,
finding significant differences with idealised simulations. In addition to detailing the system, we
also share the empirical mode transfer matrices, enabling future work in astrophotonic design,
computational imaging, device fabrication feedback loops and beam shaping.

1. Introduction

Photonic lanterns [1-3] are mode converting devices that feature an adiabatic transition between
a multimode waveguide and multiple single-mode waveguides. This feature enables numerous
applications, such as space division multiplexing in telecommunications [4], joint wavefront
sensing with imaging in astrophotonics [5—8], beam shaping [9, 10] and computational imag-
ing [11]. In all applications, knowledge the optical mode transfer matrix — the mapping from the
modes at one end of the device to the modes at the other — is critical. This mapping is linear
(i.e. it satisfies superposition and scalar multiplication) when using the complex electric field,
however past approaches typically only characterise devices in intensity. Inferring the mode
transfer matrix, is then an under-constrained non-linear problem resulting in worse generalisation
outside of the characterisation. Data-driven approaches have also been employed, requiring
solution of this under-constrained problem by fitting task specific behaviour, such as predicting
atmospheric (pupil plane) aberrations from the single-mode intensities in wavefront sensing [5,7].
A deeper, physical understanding of the modal mapping in any given photonic lantern would not
only provide stronger priors to reduce data requirements for data-driven approaches, but enable
faster design to fabrication loops and more realistic development of future applications such as
post injection coherent beam combination [12].

Simulations offer a tempting means of recovering the modal mapping by numerically propa-
gating the modes supported at one end of the device, employing algorithms such as Eigenmode
expansion [13] or the beam propagation method [14]. However the precision with which device
geometry can be specified in the manufacturing process is much looser than the level that causes

variations in the simulated transfer matrix [15,16], along with manufacturing limitations and
imperfections. Our results quantify this discrepancy and serve as a warning for the limitations of
simulation-only design for these devices.

The majority of previous work aimed at characterising photonic lanterns has measured the
intensities of modes, typically in monochromatic light [17-19]. This is blind to the rich phase
encodings and mode evolution with wavelength known to be present from theory and from
success in previous wavefront sensing work. Our approach measures the amplitude and phase
of the electric field using digital off-axis holography, and is able to follow the evolution of
the modes in wavelength over a 73 nm bandwidth. Holography [20] refers to a wide range
of techniques that typically measure the interference between the waves from an object and a
reference wave, encoding both the amplitude and phase of the light from the object. Digital
off-axis holography [21] has been used in a range of applications, including spatial biphoton
states [22] and mode sorters/multiplexers [23-25], and involves interfering the object and
reference on a digital detector. Other work on photonic lanterns [26,27] has also used digital
off-axis holography, though only at a single wavelength, on a photonic lantern supporting a
smaller number of modes. In addition to using a range of wavelengths and two polarisations, the
characterisation system in this work deals with a multicore fibre (MCF) fed photonic lantern,
injecting light into an individual port with a fibre alignment stage. Through a fibre bundle as an
adapter, the system can still characterise pigtailed devices. This work also publishes the results
of the characterisation and draws generalisable insights about the behaviour of these devices.

There is also ongoing work to measure the transfer matrix of a photonic lantern [28, 29]
proposing to use off-axis holography for the initial estimation of the modes and then using a
precisely calibrated spatial light modulator (SLM) to form the required field at the multimode
end of the device, probing each mode for characterisation. Our alternative approach removes
the complexity of requiring precisely known input electric fields at the multimode end, instead
demanding precise measurement of output electric fields: arguably a simpler problem that can
be solved more accurately. Ultimately, characterisation in both directions is needed to test
fundamental questions such as “to what extent are lantern devices adiabatic?”.

The key contributions of this work include the design and implementation of a laboratory
system for characterising a photonic lantern using digital off-axis holography. We share the
testbed architecture, insights, lessons learned, code, and post-processed data. As part of this effort,
we characterise a 19-port photonic lantern and compute its mode transfer matrix across different
polarisations and wavelengths, offering initial insights into the modal mappings. Additionally, we
identify trends in the coherence of the fields associated with different modes, including a direct
measurement of differential modal dispersion. All code, raw data and post-processed results
are made available at (link to be provided). For further technical details on the characterisation
system, see Supplement 1.

A visual summary of our approach is shown in Figure 1. Either a broadband or wavelength
sweeping source is split into a reference and injection beam. The injected beam is aligned to a
single core of the MCF (i.e. a single port of the photonic lantern), where the resulting mode is
re-imaged onto the detector through a polarisation beam displacer, providing two orthogonal
polarisations. The reference beam is collimated, tilted and projected onto the same detector,
producing fringes required for digital off-axis holography. A broadband source is used to drive
the delay line stage to the path length matched position for each port. Data is taken using
the wavelength sweeping source over all ports, both with and without the reference beam. In
post-processing (Figure | e), we recover the coherent component in Fourier space and remove the

Our pipeline then decomposes this into linearly polarised (LP) modes, providing the first ever
multi-wavelength, polarisation decomposed characterisation of a photonic lantern in addition to
revealing broadband coherence behaviour and relative throughput.

'In this work, electric fields are visualised on a two dimensional colormap, with the phase axis selected to be
perceptually uniform (the rate of color change with value appears constant) and uniform in lightness (all phases appear
equally bright) using the phase colormap in cmocean [30], and the amplitude reflected in the value. Thus, pixels with
the same amplitude appear equally bright irrespective of phase, which is not the case with the HSV colormap that is
typically used.
Definition of the mode transfer matrix

In this section, all coefficients and matrices are functions of wavelength and polarisation, however
this is omitted for brevity.

A photonic lantern is a mode sorting device that maps from mmm modes supported at the
multimode end with complex coefficients Cm € C”™™ (known as the ‘input’ in e.g. wavefront
sensing work, but the ‘output’ in beam shaping work), to the msm modes supported at the
single-mode MCF or multiple single-mode fibre (SMF) end with coefficients cs € C’™. These
coefficients form the electric field in each respective basis, with

Ennis = >, Crnin@ Be. Ean = >, ComEby, >

i i

where the sums are taken over all supported modes, EP ai is the i-th basis mode supported at
the multimode end (assumed to be a LP mode in this work), and EPs is the i-th basis mode at
the MCF end (a simple single-mode located at a position on a grid, typically hexagonal). Most
photonic lanterns are designed such that nmm = Msm at the shorter wavelengths of interest, but
this doesn’t need to be the case over the full bandwidth. Our approach makes no assumptions
about either mm OF Nsm, however we note that we expect oversample devices (mm < Msm) to
lose light to cladding modes in the characterisation direction. It could be possible to recover the
mapping in this case through exploiting the differential coherence between cladding and guided
modes, and this is left as future work.

A transfer matrix T € C’»*"™, then, is the linear transformation applied by the photonic
lantern, relating the above sets of coefficients as

Csm = TCmm- (2)

Whilst these operations are linear in the modal bases, typical measurement systems capture the
intensity |), c;E;|?, which is non-linear.

Each row of the transfer matrix determines the response of the multicore fibre port to the
electric field at the multimode end. In this work, we measure 7", the Hermitian of T. We inject a
single mode at the multicore fibre end and use digital off-axis holography to measure the complex
electric field at the multimode end, known as a principal mode [12]. Between measurements of
different ports, the system drifts in phase and hence there is an ambiguous relative phase between
different ports. Thus each reconstructed field contains a superposition with

Gon Caml! Se Meer = ert, (3)

where e; is a vector of zeros with a one at index j, and ¢¢ is a (unknown) relative phase between
ports. In other words, we measure each row of the transfer matrix up to a single absolute phase
ambiguity. In the wavelength dimension, the quantities are measured coherently and rapidly
so that there is no information-destroying phase wrapping nor large drift that occurs between
samples. Hence the relative phase is known.

2. Methods

Figure 2 illustrates the interplay between data capture, post-processing and data products, with
relevant steps linked to subsections. Data is first captured from illumination with a broadband
superluminescent diode (SLD) source, with the port positions and the position of zero path delay
found. These values are then used for the holographic data, which is captured while sweeping the
source wavelength. In the processing pipeline, centres of the mode field in each polarisation
are found in image space, and the off-axis component is fit in Fourier space. In each case, a
smooth function is fit against wavelength. The data taken without the reference beam is used for
photometry. The electric field is then reconstructed using the centres found previously. Finally,
the projection onto LP modes is computed with overlap integrals, forming the transfer matrix that
describes the modal mapping of the device. Further figures and details on the methods, including
a system block diagram and fitting performance figures can be found in Supplement 1, Sec. 1.

2.1. Wavelength calibration

The use of an electronic trigger system guarantees that the images captured during a wavelength
sweep are consistently exposed through the same range of wavelengths, however the exact
mapping must be calibrated. This frame index to wavelength calibration is done in two steps.
First, the functional form of A(f) is fit using data from a wavemeter during the sweep. We find
the sweep is weakly non-linear — with a quadratic term present that causes the sweep speed
to decrease from an initial value of 105 nm/s to a final value of 90nm/s. Next, we mark the
start and end of the sweep by monitoring the phase of the off-axis component. This is shown
in Supplement 1, Figure S2. The total duration of the sweep is less than 1s. The calibrated
mapping is then used for all later sweeps, and the laser calibration routine is run at the start of
every set of measurements to ensure no drifts. In short, 78 samples are captured spanning the
range of 1507.5 nm to 1580.5 nm.

2.2. Exciting a single port

We excite a single port (i.e. one principal mode) of the photonic lantern from the multicore
end via butt coupling on a motorized fibre alignment stage. Using multicore fibres creates the
additional challenge that we need to align fibres rather than simply using a fibre switcher. We
know the falloff with respect to position is Gaussian [31], so we measure the total intensity in
the images at a given motor position and monitor how this changes. The flux is then fit as the
sum of Gaussian functions, with centres lying on a hexagonal grid. We fit an origin, separation
and rotation of the grid, as well as the nuisance parameters of the mode field diameter and the
individual throughput per port. For a visualisation, see Supplement 1, Figure S3.

2.3. White light fringe finding

In order to capture the evolution of the mode transfer matrix with wavelength coherently, the
phase of the measured field must change by less than + between frames. The white light fringe
refers to the case where this phase change is virtually zero over a wide range of wavelengths,
such that interference fringes are visible even at large bandwidth. The position of the white light
fringe in the interferometer is found by changing the length of the injection arm using the delay
line stage shown in Figure | a and a broadband (50 nm) SLD. The white light fringe occurs when
the off-axis power is maximised. The position used when taking data with the sweeping source is
the midpoint between the maxima for the H and V polarisations, such that both are high visibility
during the sweep. Results from this step are shown in Supplement 1, Figure S6.

2.4. Digital off-axis holography reconstruction

In order to reconstruct the field, we must first centre in the image plane. For each polarisation and
at each wavelength, the photometry data is co-added, the outline of the core found through Canny
edge detection [32] and then the centre estimated using a least squares circle estimator [33]. A
sub-pixel Fourier shift of the frame then places the pattern at the centre and crops the image. In
the Fourier plane, we use a custom geometric circle finding algorithm that seeks the smallest disk
to encase a given amount of flux. Both the image and Fourier centre estimates are smoothed by
fitting as a function of wavelength, reflecting weak chromaticity in system components (in image
space) or the radial frequency smearing (in Fourier space). For a visualisation of these steps, see
Supplement 1, Figure S4.
The reconstruction of the electric field E; from an image at a known wavelength is given by
Ej = E):F —' (Lo(Wrourier) (F (Wimageli))), (4)

ref.

where Eyer is the estimated electric field of the reference beam, ’ denotes the conjugate, F denotes
the Fourier transform (with inverse F~!), Tg is a translation operator with parameter 6 = (4, Oy)
(implemented using a phase ramp in Fourier space), Wimage and Wrourier are windows with width
and shape parameters, and J; is the holographic image from port i. The electric field of the
reference E,.¢ is estimated with the phase determined by a Fourier transform of a delta function
located at the peak of the power spectrum, and a uniform amplitude.

The filtering of only off-axis components means that low order aberrations manifesting near
zero spatial frequency are removed, and results in strong robustness to read noise. Intuitively the
reconstruction of off-axis holography data can be thought of as using the intensity to recover the
field amplitude and the curvature of the fringes to infer the derivative of the phase.

2.5. Projection onto LP modes

After reconstructing the fields, we calculate the overlap integral 7, given by

mij = (Eis Eb, j) (5)
[ ABYdA

(/ |A/?aA) (f \eP aa),

where the integrals are over the plane perpendicular to the fibre face, 7 is the index of the lantern
port used and again E>, j is the j-th basis mode supported at the multimode end. A normalised

where (A, B) = (6)

field is denoted as E. We approximate the integrals as a sum over a grid, with mode profiles found
using the of iber package [34]. The physical fibre diameter used to generate the LP modes
is measured using a microscope beforehand, and the refractive index contrast is known from
manufacturing specifications. The plate scale of the injection arm is fit such that the maximum
(power weighted) overlap value is achieved.

In this work we only employ LP modes, however we note that this is only an approximation.
Due to structures from the multicore fibre remaining in the multimode end, the refractive index
is not a simple top hat function. Future work could directly apply basis modes that are solved
numerically to better reflect this structure.
3. Results

Here we present the results of the characterisation of the 19-port photonic lantern. See Supplement
1, Sec. 3 for validation of the characterisation system on a SMF, white light fringe finding and
throughput/overlap integral performance of the device.

We fabricate a 19-port photonic lantern with a multimode diameter of 34.7 yum, a core refractive
index of 1.44 and a cladding index with a contrast of 5.5 x 10-3. Over the wavelengths swept,
the output supports 23 LP modes below A, = 1562 nm and 21 LP modes above A... Hence, this
is a marginally undersampled lantern, manufactured in order to guarantee that all the modes of
interest are well within the strong guiding regime over the whole operational wavelength range.

The characterisation system takes data for this device in just over one hour, with time primarily
spent on finding the position of the white light fringe. The data capture with the swept wavelength

source takes less than 10 minutes, an important feature in enabling a tight feedback loop in the
manufacture of devices.

diversity of the modes supported. See Supplement 2 for a video of all ports through all
wavelengths.

Figure 3 shows the steps of our reconstruction. The first two rows are dark subtracted data,
taken without and with the reference beam respectively. Despite each port having the same input
beam (including polarisation), after propagation through the device the polarisation changes in a
port dependent way. In the cases where a port appears dim in H (such as port 3), there is good
signal in V. The following rows show our reconstruction. The intensity of the reconstructed field
|E|? is in good agreement with the photometry (reference beam blocked) data. The reconstructed
fields show localised blobs with nulls between them, a wide range of phases and are well contained
by the core outline, as expected. The fields are also consistent with a superposition of LP modes,
with the decomposition showing agreement to the field itself. This decomposition is reasonable
but imperfect (see e.g. the top left or bottom right of port 4), motivating future work with a more
complex modal basis. Finally, we also visualise the fields on an Argand diagram, illustrating
a unique structure for each port. Importantly, the reconstruction is of reasonable quality even
in low SNR — with the resulting field still well explained by LP modes. This is due to the
robustness of digital off-axis holography where only the coherent information is extracted, and
hence contamination such as background and read noise are suppressed.

characterisation system produces transfer matrix cubes that are coherent through
wavelength. Here we explore three slices through the cube. b Mode evolution
along wavelength. ¢ Monochromatic transfer matrix per polarisation. This lantern
has contributions from many modes to each port, which enables good inference of
the input field with only intensity measurements. d Slices of the same port and
wavelength in different polarisations. The fields appear visually similar (top row),
however subtle differences exist (middle row). Over ports and wavelengths the fields of
different polarisations (stacked histogram, bottom row) exhibit a dissimilarity that is
not explained by a difference in signal alone (see text for details).

Figure 4 a summarises the measurement dimensions available in our post processed transfer
matrices. Slices through wavelength (Figure 4 b) show the evolution of modes in amplitude and
phase. There are some oscillations present due to birefringence in the system (see Supplement
1 for details), but they are common mode and the trend of modes is clearly a slowly varying
function in both amplitude and phase. Relative measurements are very precise and explored
further in Figure 6. Slices at a particular wavelength (Figure 4 ¢) yield monochromatic transfer
matrices in a given polarisation. Previous work [6] has only ever used simulations to generate
these, and hence shows strong symmetry between ports on opposite sides of the multicore fibre
grid. We do not observe this, highlighting the significance of manufacturing variations from a
target design.

Furthermore, we can compare slices in polarisation, visualised in Figure 4d. The electric fields
from each polarisation appear identical up to a spatially constant phase offset. Taking differences
in amplitude, however, we see changes by up to 10% in some regions, with a structure that is
not consistent with centring residuals alone. In phase, we observe a near uniform difference,
with a weak tilt likely caused by a minor deviation in angle from the beam displacer. In the
bottom row, we report a similarity statistic over a few ports and all wavelengths in a stacked
histogram. We normalise the LP coefficients for a given port and wavelength, and then compute
the magnitude of the inner product between the two polarisations. For very similar fields with a
arbitrary, spatially constant phase offset, this metric is close to unity. Since the quality of the
LP overlap is related to the flux, we also report the median flux difference between H and V,
ie. the median of (fy — fv)/(fu + fv) over all wavelengths. Values closer to +1 have less
flux in one polarisation, are expected to have less correct LP mode projections, and hence lower
similarity even if the true fields are similar. We observe a port independent bound of around 0.94,
consistent with the phase and amplitude differences shown above that are from the limitations of
the imaging system, such as the tolerance on the parallelism of the polarisation beam displacer
and the compensating plate. There is, however, port dependence that indicates a weak difference
in the electric fields of different polarisations. This is most evident between ports 0 and 2, from
which a LP quality argument would favour higher similarity in port 2 but the data suggests port 0
has higher similarity. This warrants further investigation with more devices.

simulation. Each curve is one port. The falloff becomes near linear after 20 nm (grey
box). ¢ Gradient of similarity decay for simulated and measured fields over all ports.

Figure 5 shows the breadth of wavelength dependent data available from our system. First, we
show the electric field for one polarisation for different ports. All ports change at approximately
the same rate, with neighbouring panels appearing identical up to an overall phase, while distant
panels are clearly different. The overall phase evolution is generated from being offset from
the white light fringe, recalling that we took the midpoint between the two polarisations and
hence are ~ 85 zm from the white light fringe in both. Next, we quantify the wavelength scale
of field evolution in the device by measuring the overlap integral of the field at a particular
wavelength (black dashed line) compared to all other wavelengths. The characteristic scale for
the mode field to change noticeably is of order 20 nm, broadly consistent with previous results
in wavefront sensing [5]. The falloff is near linear around 20 nm from the fixed wavelength.
Both the simulation and measurement agree in the functional form (smooth turning point with
linear decay) but the rate of decay can be slower or faster in the actual device, depending on
the port. Finally, we visualise the rate of decay in this linear region on the port map of the
device. Generally, ports towards the centre of the MCF decay faster, however the device clearly
does not have the symmetry of the idealised simulation. The difference in wavelength needed
for principal modes to become orthogonal could be as little as 100/1.8 = 56nm or as much as
100/0.6 = 167 nm.

Direct measurement of relative modal dispersion

Finally, since our characterisation system probes the device response to coherent light, we are
able to directly measure differential observables of the modal dispersion of the photonic lanterns.
From data such as Figure 4 b, we observe that oscillations in measured phase are common
between modes, suggesting that these are present from weak birefringence outside of the photonic
lantern itself. Hence, our approach is much more sensitive to differential measurements between
modes than at first glance. We now consider differential phase measurements between modes
to directly measure the relative modal dispersion, noting that this result is insensitive to any
birefringence in the system and the MCF part of the photonic lantern.

Figure 6 shows this analysis with a comparison to an idealised, yet typically used, scalar
simulation. For each mode, we fit a line to the phase relative to LPO1, the gradient of which is
the relative modal dispersion. This is repeated for different polarisations and with the simulated
data and summarised in Figure 6 c. Each measurement is extremely repeatable, with the median
scatter (standard deviation from 6 sweeps) over all modes above the cut as 1074 rad/nm. We can
also estimate an upper bound for the systematic error introduced by background contamination
at low signal. A 5% background signal can make at most a 2 x arctan(0.05) rad contribution
to the phase over the whole bandwidth, or a change 0.1/73 = 1.5 x 10~ rad/nm in the signal
plotted, an order of magnitude smaller than the differences observed between modes. We also
note that this upper bound on systematic error would not apply to differences between ports,
as this contamination is common to all ports. Hence, we conclude that majority of the scatter
between ports and modes is real signal, and that the simulation is too idealised. There are also
subtle differences between the polarisations that again warrant further investigation with different
devices.

4. Discussion

In this section we highlight some implications of our findings on applications involving photonic
lanterns.

First, we provide a warning for the use of simulation alone in modelling these devices. Previous
results [6] have shown high symmetry in the transfer matrix between ports on opposite sides
of the hexagonal grid. Our characterisation shows no evidence of this, highlighting the need
for physical device characterisation over simulation alone. We would be capable of discerning
if this variation is a fixed or variable offset from the design target given multiple devices, and
leave this as future work. Broadly, simulations seem to match the same order of magnitude and
functional form as the fabricated device — such as with the gradient of similarity decay in Figure 5

or the modal dispersion in Figure 6 — but the predictions of observables vary from measured
performance in a significant way that could be ruinous if relied upon for downstream tasks.

As a more concrete example, instrument concepts that involve coherent combination of
photonic lantern outputs, such as [12] require careful consideration of the port dependent optical
path difference induced by the multicore fibre (measured at up to 750 zm per metre of fibre) as
well as the modal dispersion. Our modal dispersion findings (Figure 6) suggest that such an
instrument must be spectrally dispersed with a sampling finer than 1.6 nm (for 0.1 rad difference)
to maintain coherence between different modes in different ports. We also find that the typical
wavelength scale for the evolution of the principal mode is of order 20 nm, but this value varies
between ports.

Next, data driven approaches, especially where data is expensive, should leverage characterisa-
tion results as a prior to fitting. For example, an image reconstruction algorithm for high angular
resolution astrophotonics should use the measured transfer matrix as the heart of a model that
can be fine tuned in-situ using intensity measurements. More generally, estimators using the
characterised photonic lantern should be regularised to be consistent with the characterisation.
The transfer matrix can also serve in optimal experiment design, where observations could
be planned around maximising sensitivity to scientific outcomes depending on the location of
objects in the device’s field of view.

Previous work for computational imaging [11] with photonic lanterns for areas such as
microendoscopy has promising initial results. In particular, more advanced and powerful imaging
schemes leverage coherent combination, and hence require knowledge of the relative phases and
amplitudes the fields induced by exciting each port. Our characterisation system provides almost
all of this information directly. For microendoscopy specifically, the mode/port counts must be
considerably higher than the 19-port device in this work, however the approach can scale whilst
still remaining tractable — we envisage the time needed for swept data taking to be around 10s per
port, equivalent to characterising a 1000 port device in under 3 hours. In this case, time taken to
find the white light fringe could be decreased significantly by using a bandpass filter for a longer
coherence length (hence less sampling of the delay line motor) and a more innovative sampler
that leverages correlation between ports (rather than a fixed step size).

Beyond immediate applications, the existence and extent of birefringence and polarisation
dependent loss within photonic lanterns remain open questions; weak differences between
fields with different polarisations are present, and dispersions are different, warranting further
investigation with a wider range of devices. Our characterisation approach offers sensitivity to
these quantities, however upgrades to reduce system birefringence might be required to make
convincing progress. Another possible upgrade would be to vary the input polarisation at device
injection in addition to the existing measurement of output polarisation. Such an experiment
would verify to what extent orthogonal polarisations remain orthogonal through the device, with
consequences for polarisation multiplexing in telecommunications.

Our system has the limitation that we can not directly measure the relative phase between
principal modes of different ports since the laboratory environment causes the two arms to drift in
phase between measurements of different ports. However, such a measurement is very sensitive
to the bend of the multicore fibre that feeds the device (see Supplement 1, Figure S6). If the
application after characterisation requires coherent combination — where the phase between ports
matters — then the system is sensitive to the environment near the multicore fibre and should have
this aspect characterisable in-situ.

5. Conclusion

Photonic lanterns provide an efficient means of mapping from a multimode basis set to multiple
single modes (or vice versa), however this mapping is only loosely constrained at the design
stage, with manufacturing limitations causing significant deviations from the target. In this
work, we design and implement a characterisation system that directly measures the complex
mode transfer matrix, using digital off-axis holography to reconstruct the electric field of the
resulting mode from injection into a single port. We follow the evolution of these fields over a
73 nm range near 1550 nm. This provides the first multi-wavelength, polarisation decomposed
characterisation of these multimode converters. In analysing the measured transfer function, we
uncover the typical wavelength scale of principal mode evolution (agreeing with inferences made
in previous work) and make a direct measurement of the modal dispersion within the device.
We find differences in dispersion and symmetries compared to idealised simulation, reinforcing
the need for empirical characterisation of all manufactured devices. The system presented and
the resulting data enhance future work in astrophotonic design, computational imaging, device
fabrication and beam shaping.

There are exciting avenues of future work with this characterisations system. It is now possible
to study how the transfer matrix varies with different architectures, such as hybrid mode-selective
photonic lanterns. Furthermore, the manufacturing repeatability of these devices can be measured
directly. Finally, further work is needed to understand polarisation dependence in the photonic
lantern, and how this changes with device design and fabrication parameters.
