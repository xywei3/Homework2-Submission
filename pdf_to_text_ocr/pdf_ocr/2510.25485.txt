(Dated: October 30, 2025)

In this paper, we utilize the ray-tracing method to conduct an in-depth study of the observational
images of asymmetric thin-shell wormholes in the Kalb-Ramond field. Initially, we calculate the
null geodesics and effective potential energy of ATSW, and investigate the variations in the photon
sphere radius and critical impact parameter under different values of charge Q and Lorentz-violating
parameter J. Based on these calculations, we determine the photon deflection angles and trajectories
within this space-time structure. Specifically, depending on the photon impact parameters, the
photon trajectories can be categorized into three types. By using a thin accretion disk as the sole
background light source and incorporating two classical observational radiation models, we find
that under conditions of equal mass M, charge quantity Q, and Lorentz-violation parameter 1, the
asymmetric thin-shell wormhole exhibits unique observational features such as additional lensing
rings and photon ring clusters. Furthermore, distinct from black holes, as the charge quantity Q
and the Lorentz-violation parameter | increase, the coverage area of the specific additional halo also
expands correspondingly.

I. INTRODUCTION

In 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) made the first detection of gravitational
waves, directly confirming the existence of binary stellar-mass black holes-a landmark achievement in astrophysics [I].
Subsequently, in 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) released images of the supermassive black holes at the
centers of the M87 galaxy and Sagittarius A* [2], providing further evidence for the existence of such supermassive
black holes. The black hole images display a central dark region surrounded by a bright ring: the dark area results
from the black hole’s intense gravity bending and capturing light, preventing it from reaching distant observers, thus
forming what is known as the black hole shadow. The outer bright ring is referred to as the photon ring (or critical
curve) [3].

The study of black hole shadows has always been a hot topic in the field of physics [4}{8]. Synge was the first to
calculate and determine the boundary of the black hole shadow , while Luminet, pioneered the study of the angular
radius equation for the photon capture region in a Schwarzschild black hole [9] [10]. In recent years, this field has seen
remarkable developments within the framework of modified gravity theories. On the observational front, Heino Falcke
and his colleagues were the first to propose the concept of the black hole shadow, and their work directly contributed
to the development and advancement of EHT . Although the EHT’s observations are largely consistent with the
black hole shadow predictions of General Relativity, they do not rule out the existence of certain Ultra-Compact
Objects (UCOs) [I2HI4]. In fact, objects such as wormholes and boson stars could potentially cast shadows very
similar to those of black holes . Consequently, finding methods to effectively distinguish UCOs from black
holes has become a crucial research direction.

Interestingly, Matt Visser proposed a novel construction known as the Thin-Shell Wormhole, which connects two
distinct space-times via a throat, allowing for potential traversal [21] [22]. Building upon this theoretical framework,
Wang investigates the optical appearance of an Asymmetric Thin-Shell Wormhole (ATSW) [23], and reveale that its
shadow is consistently smaller than that produced by a black hole-a significant result that provides favorable support
for the direct observation of wormholes. Subsequent research has primarily focused on the double shadow phenomenon
generated by ATSWs. The presence of this double shadow may offer an alternative method for indirectly observing
ATSW [24] [25]. Observational results of these dual shadows could not only test predictions of General Relativity but
also enhance our understanding of gravitational effects and space-time curvature [26}28]. Furthermore, Peng et al.
concentrated on the observational signatures of accretion disks and the additional photon rings around a Schwarzschild
ATSW [29]. These features can likewise serve as a method to distinguish ATSWs from black holes. Beyond this, other
researchers have studied the observational appearance of wormholes in Hayward space-time and the appearance of a
freely falling star within an ATSW [30}33]. Inspired by these studies, this paper will investigate the observational
characteristics of an ATSW surrounded by an accretion disk within the context of Kalb-Ramond(KR) gravity.

The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section[I]] an ATSW is constructed within the KR field. We investigate
its geodesics and effective potential, and subsequently calculate the deflection and trajectories of photons in this
ATSW space-time. Section [ITA] examines the transfer functions and observational appearances of both a BH and
an ATSW, each surrounded by a thin accretion disk and under the same mass parameter, for two emission models.
Finally, our conclusions are presented in Section |I

II. NULL GEODESICS AND EFFECTIVE POTENTIAL OF THE ATSW IN THE KALB-RAMOND
FIELD

In the 1970s, Kalb and Ramond introduced the concept of an antisymmetric tensor field [34]. The KR field is a
second-rank antisymmetric tensor [35}{40]. It plays a significant role in theoretical physics by not only extending the
understanding of gauge fields in quantum field theory but also being applied to advanced research areas such as string
theory and dark matter. In recent years, substantial progress has been made in this field, with researchers having
derived Schwarzschild-like solutions and rotating black hole solutions within the KR field framework [4]. Our study
will commence from the action of the KR field to conduct further investigation

In the theoretical framework, R denotes the Ricci scalar, 7 and £1, €2 are coupling constants representing the non-
minimal coupling terms between gravity and the KR field, while Cy refers to the Lagrangian of the electromagnetic
field. In our previous work, we investigated the influence of the charge Q and the Lorentz-violating parameter / on
black hole shadows [42]. Specifically, the study focused on a KR black hole surrounded by a thin accretion disk. It
was found that an increase in the charge Q and the Lorentz-violating parameter | leads to a reduction in the size of
the black hole shadow, as well as in the direct image, lensing ring, and photon ring. The present research shifts focus
to the optical characteristics of an Asymmetric Thin-Shell Wormhole within the KR framework. This investigation is
motivated by two key aspects: First, previous studies on Bardeen-type ATSWs have shown that the magnetic charge
g significantly affects their optical appearance [31]. This intriguing result prompts us to examine whether the charge
Q and the Lorentz-violating parameter | similarly induce changes in the optical appearance of the KR field ATSW,
analogous to the case of the KR black hole. Second, we aim to determine whether shadow-related characteristics can
provide a viable method for distinguishing an ATSW from a black hole.

The ATSW consists of two space-times with distinct mass parameters, M, and Mp, connected by a thin shell (ie,
the throat), with the entire ATSW manifold denoted by M = M, U Mg. Based on Eq. (i). with the cosmological
constant A set to zero, we derive the following equation [41]

Here, M, Q, and | represent the black hole’s mass, charge, and Lorentz-violating parameter, respectively. Expanding

In which, i = 1,2 denotes the two space-time regions, R represents the position of the thin shell and satisfies the
condition R > max {rp,,Tr,}, where rp, and rp, represent the event horizon radii of black holes with mass parameters
M, and Mb, respectively. Considering that gravity acts as the sole interaction when photons pass through the throat,
the 4-momentum p4(A = t,r,0,¢) of the photon remains conserved.

Since the space-time is symmetric, photons possess two conserved quantities: E; = —p:, (energy) and L; = pg,

In Eq. (7), + and — represent the photon’s outgoing and incoming directions, respectively. Consequently, we can

Here, b. and rp denote the critical impact parameter and the photon sphere radius, respectively. The primary objective
of this paper is to investigate a method for distinguishing an ATSW from a black hole within the KR field, specifically
under the condition where the event horizon is obscured by the photon sphere. To this end, we assume an observer
is situated in the space-time with mass parameter M, = 1, and the mass parameter of the other space-time M2
is set to Mz = k. Under this configuration, the parameters k and the throat radius R must satisfy the following

In essence, within the valid range of the parameter k, its specific value does not qualitatively affect the subsequent
results and discussion. Therefore, we adopt the approach used in prior studies and set the value of k = 1.2 [24] [29].
Consequently, the relationship between the impact parameters b; and b2 for the space-times M1 and M, can be derived
as follows

To study the effects of the charge Q and the Lorentz-violating parameter | on the photon sphere radius rp, and the
critical collision parameter b,, calculations were conducted using the formula for the photon sphere radius with M, = 1
and Mp = 1.2. The results are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. Based on the relevant research, the charge Q is limited
to the range from 0 to 0.6, and the Lorentz-violating parameter / is limited to the range from 0 to 0.1. It was observed
that when Q = 0 and | = 0, the scenario corresponds to the Schwarzschild ATSW, and when / = 0, it corresponds to
the Reissner-Nordstrém case.

that with the increase in charge Q and the Lorentz-violating parameter /, the effective potential energy of the BH

From the observations of Fig. (b), we note that, for a given charge Q or Lorentz-violating parameter
1, photons exhibit three distinct trajectories [3]. For the case where / = 0.1 and Q = 0.1, as indicated by the black
line in Fig.]1](b): When by < Zb., = 3.708, the photon falls from spacetime M, into spacetime M2 and moves toward
infinity. When Zb,., < b1 < be, = 5.11841, the photon enters the potential barrier in spacetime M2 and then returns to
spacetime M,. When b; < Zb,,, the photon moves to the potential barrier in spacetime MM, and then travels toward
infinity in M,.

To better understand the optical characteristics of the ATSW in the KR field, we calculated the azimuthal change

Ill. THE OPTICAL APPEARANCE OF AN ATSW

The photon reflection mechanism in an ATSW differs from that of a BH. To investigate the differences in observable
appearances between the ATSW in the KR field and a BH, we will consider incident photons with specific impact
parameters. In this section, we study the ATSW in the KR field surrounded by an optically and geometrically thin
accretion disk. By employing two radiation models, we compare the observational signatures of the ATSW and the

BH.

spacetime M2. The parameters are fixed at | = 0.01, R = 2.6, Mz =1, and Mz = 1.2.

A. The trajectory of a photon

First, in a stationary coordinate system with the BH fixed in the equatorial plane, for a static observer located at
infinite distance in the direction of the North Pole, the light source comes from infinite distance in the direction of
the South Pole. By categorizing the total number n of times photon trajectories cross the equatorial plane, Gralla et
al. studied the optical appearance of a BH surrounded by a thin disk [30]

n= plan. (17)

From the perspective of an observer at infinity, photon trajectories around a black hole are classified into three
distinct types according to their orbit number n:

Fig. [5] and Fig. [6] illustrate the relationship between the number of photon trajectories and the impact parameter
b; around an ATSW, under the influence of charge Q and the Lorentz-violating parameter 1. In Fig.|5|(a) and |6] (a),
it is observed that the photon trajectories for n; are similar to those of a black hole, indicating that these photons
will continue to propagate in spacetime M. In contrast, trajectories corresponding to ng and ng appear only in
the ATSW. When a photon enters the throat from spacetime M1, passes through the potential barrier in spacetime
Mb, and returns to spacetime Mj, the outgoing photons intersect with the back side of the thin accretion disk if the
conditions in Fig. |5|(b) and |6|(b) are met—specifically, when nz < 0.75 (solid line) and 0.75 < ng (dashed line).
Conversely, when nz < 1.25 and 1.25 < ng, the outgoing photons intersect with the front side of the thin accretion
disk. Furthermore, analysis of Fig. |5}(b) and 6] (b) indicates that the range of the impact parameter b, decreases
as both the charge Q and Lorentz-violating parameter | increase. This result suggests that additional photon rings
contract toward the inner region of the ATSW shadow with increasing values of Q and |. Additionally, it is noted
that n1, m2, and n3 are more significantly influenced by the Lorentz-violating parameter | than by the charge Q.

B. Observed intensity and transfer function

To better understand the observable appearance of the ATSW, we model the radiation source as an optically and
geometrically thin accretion disk located in spacetime M, of the ATSW. As previously stated, a static observer is
positioned at infinity along the northern polar direction. Here, we maintain the assumption that the static observer
in spacetime lM! is located in the same polar orientation, while the thin accretion disk resides in the equatorial
plane. Owing to the symmetry of spacetime and the isotropic emission from the accretion disk, the radiation intensity
depends solely on the radial coordinate and is denoted as [$™(r), where v represents the emission frequency in the
static frame. Thus, we obtain

on trajectory is determined by the transfer function

Tm (bi). When m = 1, m = 2, and m = 3, they correspond to the direct emission, lensing ring, and photon ring
of the thin accretion disk, respectively. The relationship between the transfer function and the impact parameter
is illustrated in Fig. and Fig. ig]. where we have considered the effects of varying charge and Lorentz -violating
parameters.

Fig. and Fig. is} show the relationship between the trans
influence of the charge Q and the Lorentz-violating parameter |. The selected values for Q are 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5,
while for / they are 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1. From Fig. [7] and Fig. BI. it can be observed that the first transfer function
(m = 1), represented by the black solid line, corresponds to the direct image of the accretion disk. Due to its relatively
small slope-where dr(b;)/db; is defined as the demagnification factor, the small demagnification leads to the observed
intensity being dominated by the direct image. The second transfer function (m = 2), shown as the blue solid line,
exhibits a larger demagnification factor, forming a demagnified lensing ring from the back side of the thin accretion
disk and contributing only marginally to the observed intensity. The third transfer function (m = 3), represented by

er function and the impact parameter 6; under the

As shown in Fig and Fig. [8], a comparison of the transfer functions between the BH and the ATSW reveals

C. Optical Appearance of Thin Accretion Disks under Two Emission Models in an Asymmetric Thin-Shell
‘Wormhole

To better understand the optical appearance of an ATSW in a KR field, this section investigates its observable
features through two distinct emission models of a thin accretion disk. The optical appearance of the black hole
observed by a static observer at infinity is also determined by the emission model of the thin accretion disk[43}.

The radiation peak is achieved at r = risco, and then decreases as r increases, approaching zero. There is no
radiation emission within the photon unstable orbit radius. We have plotted the radiation function, as shown in
Fig. fg (a). Additionally, we have depicted the optical appearance of black holes with the same mass parameter and
radiation model A in the first row of Fig. 10. For better comparison, we have performed numerical simulations of the
observational intensity, density distribution, and local density distribution of ATSW using model A, as shown in the
second row of Fig.|10|. By comparing Fig. [10] (a) and Fig. (b), it is evident that BH and ATSW exhibit significant
differences in their optical structures, with distinct spatial separations between the direct radiation ring, lens ring,
and photon ring. Observing Fig. (a), we find that the observational intensity of ATSW appears at the critical
curve b; ~ 6.8289M,, with an intensity of 0.4529, which subsequently decreases to zero. The lens ring is located
within a narrow region between the critical curves b) ~ 5.3774], and b; ~ 5.8891M,. The photon rings appear near
the critical curves at b; ~ 3.7221M), b; ~ 4.9676M,, and b; ~ 5.1213M,. Compared to BH, intriguingly, two new
photon rings emerge in the shadow of ATSW, located near the critical curves at bj ~ 3.7221M, and by ~ 4. 9676/1,
as shown in Fig.[10|(a) and (d). By examining Fig.|10](b) and (c), it is observed that the direct emi
is near the edge of the black disk, while the lens ring is positioned inside the black disk. Furthermore, Fig. {10}
(£) reveal that the additional photon rings of ATSW are closer to the black disk.

In emission model B, the radiation profile is defined by the following expression

in which, rp, represents the event horizon radius. The radiation peak is achieved at r = r;,, and then decreases as r
increases, approaching zero. There is no radiation emission within the photon unstable orbit. The image of radiation
model B is shown in Fig. [9] (b), where the decline in radiation value with increasing r is more gradual compared to
radiation model A. Additionally, we have plotted the optical appearance of black holes with the same mass parameter
and radiation model B in the first row of Fig. (yj. For better comparison, we have performed numerical simulations
of the observational intensity, density distribution, and local density distribution of ATSW using model B, as shown
in the second row of Figure 10. It can be observed that there is partial overlap in the regions of the direct radiation
ring, lens ring, and photon ring in ATSW. The direct ring in ATSW starts radiating at b; ~ 2.7449). Interestingly,

ring between the critical curves at b) ~ 3.7164M, and b; ~ 5.1139). Consequently, this enhances the observational
intensity of ATSW.

We have plotted the observational intensity, density maps, and local density maps for the ATSW in the KR field
under two sets of parameters: Q = 0.3, 1 = 0.01 and Q = 0.3, | = 0.05, for two radiation models, as shown in
Fig. -Observing Fig. it is found that in radiation model A, for the case of Q = 0.3, | = 0.01,
the two additional photon rings are located at b) ~ 3.8425M, and b; ~ 4.0561Mj, respectively; for Q = 0.3, 1 = 0.05,
the two additional photon rings are located at b; ~ .9942M, and b; ~ 4.7456M,, respectively. In radiation model B,
for Q = 0.3, | = 0.01, the additional lensing ring is located between b; ~ 3.8221M, and b; ~ 5.056M;; for Q = 0.3,
1 = 0.05, the additional lensing ring is located between b, ~ 3.968614, and b; ~ 5.0764M,. The results indicate that
as the charge Q and the Lorentz-violating parameter / increase, the range of light bands outside the shadow decreases,
but the range of specific additional rings increases. Therefore, the trend of change in the external shadow region is
the same as that of the KR field BH, while the trend of change in specific additional rings is opposite.

Iv. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

This paper primarily investigates the observational characteristics of ATSW and BH under the same mass parameter
M, charge Q, and Lorentz-violating parameter | in the KR field. Unlike BH, ATSW connects two spacetimes with
mass parameters 1, and M2 through a throat, assuming that the observer at infinity is located in the spacetime with
mass parameter Mj. Initially, we calculate the variations in the photon sphere radius and critical impact parameter
b. in the ATSW spacetime under different values of charge Q and Lorentz-violating parameter J, as shown in Table 1
and Table 2. The results indicate that as the charge Q and Lorentz-violating parameter / increase, the photon sphere

FIG. 11. (color online) In Model B, the observed intensity, density map, and partial density map for a BH with KR structure
(top row) and an ATSW (bottom row) are presented. The first, second, and third columns correspond to the observed intensity,
density map, and partial density map, respectively. The parameters are set as Q = 0.1,! = 0.01, R = 2.6, M; = 1, and Mp = 1.2.

radius rp and critical impact parameter b, decrease accordingly. Next, we plot the relationship between the effective
potential energy of ATSW and BH and the variations in charge Q and Lorentz-violating parameter /, as illustrated in
Fig.1 and Fig.2. The photon trajectories can be categorized into three scenarios: when b; < Zb,,, photons fall from
the M1 spacetime into the M2 spacetime and move to infinity; when Zb,, < b1 < be,, photons enter the potential
barrier of the M2 spacetime from the M1 spacetime and then return to the MM) spacetime; when b; > be,, photons
reach the potential barrier of the M, spacetime and then move towards infinity in the Mj, spacetime.

To better understand the photon trajectories and deflection angles, we have plotted the photon trajectories and
deflection angles under different values of charge Q and Lorentz-violating parameter |, as shown in Fig.3 and Fig.4.
The results indicate that b., decreases with the increase of Q and 1, whereas Zb,,, exhibits an opposite trend. It is also
observed that the photon trajectories are significantly influenced by the Lorentz-violating parameter /. Additionally,
we have calculated the transfer functions of ATSW and found that, unlike BH, ATSW possesses new second and third
transfer functions, which correspond to the lens ring and photon ring group, respectively. The unique significance
of the new transfer functions in the ATSW spacetime is that when Zb., < bi < be,, the spacetime M2 can return
photons to the spacetime MM).

Finally, we investigated the observational characteristics of ATSW and BH under two radiation models of a thin
accretion disk. In radiation model A, unlike BH, ATSW exhibits two additional photon rings near the critical curves
at by ~ 3.7221M, and by ~ 4.9676M;. In radiation model B, unlike BH, ATSW presents an additional lens ring
between the critical curves at by ~ 3.7164, and b; ~ 5.1139. Therefore, these distinct observational features
may provide an important basis for distinguishing ATSW from BH in observations.
