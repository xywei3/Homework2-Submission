KTaO3 (KTO) is an incipient ferroelectric, characterized by a softening of the lowest transverse
optical (TO) mode with decreasing temperature. Cooper pairing in the recently discovered KTO-
based heterostructures has been proposed to be mediated by the soft TO mode. Here we study
the electron coupling to the zone-center odd-parity modes of bulk KTO by means of relativistic
Density Functional Perturbation Theory (DFPT). The coupling to the soft TO mode is by far the
largest, with comparable contributions from both intraband and interband processes. Remarkably,

we find that for this mode, non-spin-conserving matrix elements are particularly relevant.

We

develop a three-band microscopic model with spin-orbit coupled tz, orbitals that reproduces the main
features of the ab initio results. For the highest energy band, the coupling can be understood as a
“dynamical” isotropic Rashba effect. In contrast, for the two lowest bands, the Rashba-like coupling
becomes strongly anisotropic. The DFPT protocol implemented here enables the calculation of the
full electron-phonon coupling matrix projected onto any mode of interest, and it is easily applicable

to other systems.

magni-
ude higher than in STO), T. + 1K in [110], and no sign
of superconductivity in the [001] down to 25 mK.

Because of the heavy Ta ion, KTO also presents a
strong SOC, splitting the ta, orbitals at T by + 400 meV
43, 44], a 14 times larger split than in STO. Moreover, a
strong violation of the Pauli limit for in-plane magnetic
fields is observed both in [111] and [110] oriented inter-
faces [45-49], an effect that has been attributed to SOC
effects. Interestingly, the softening of the TO mode has
also been recently measured in STO- and KTO-based in-
erfaces by surface-sensitive spectroscopy [50]. All these
facts raise the question of the relevance of the SOC-
assisted Rashba-like coupling to the soft mode for super-
conductivity, and may offer new insights into the pairing
mechanism.

In the insulating regime, the zero-qg longitudinal optical
(LO) component stiffens due to the long-range Coulomb
interaction, making the soft mode transverse. At low
densities, when the electronic plasma frequency is lower
than the LO phonon frequency, the LO-TO splitting re-
mains. At sufficiently high densities, however, the elec-
tronic screening causes both frequencies to become de-
generate, eventually rendering them both soft near the
FE instability. In this case, the momentum dependence
becomes important, as the screening occurs only for
wavevectors smaller than the Thomas-Fermi wavevector.
Taking into account the screening of both the matrix el-
ements and the phonon frequency is challenging and re-
quires a very high momentum resolution [51].

Because in the conventional EPC (i.e., without spin-
orbit effects), the coupling to the LO phonon dominates,
how the LO frequency is treated is crucial. Ref. [52]
considered both conventional EPC and spin-orbit effects,
ut, as the authors acknowledge, did not take fully into
account the LO-TO splitting. This may lead to overes-
imating the conventional EPC as the frequency of the
LO phonon is assumed to be soft in a large region of
momentum space. Hence, it becomes difficult to com-
are the conventional and SOC-assisted EPC on the same
grounds.

Here, we focus on the coupling to the soft mode
hrough the “dynamical” Rashba effect, which is ex-
ected to display a weak dependence on momentum and
doping, in contrast to the conventional coupling to the
LO mode, which requires very demanding numerical re-
sources (i.e. doping-dependent large momentum resolu-
ion), beyond our present scope.

The Rashba-like coupling originates from real-space
electronic hopping processes induced by the atomic dis-
lacements of the phonons. In a simplified model for
KTO, they can be understood in terms of hopping pro-
cesses among spin-1/2 tz, orbitals |wo) with p = 2, y, z,
corresponding to dzy,dz2 and dz, orbitals respectively.
For spin-conserving hopping processes, the EPC matrix
element results of order t,,,. Here t,,, is the derivative of
a hopping matrix element between two orbitals in neigh-
oring sites with respect to a polar distortion, times the
harmonic characteristic length of the phonon, and thus

has units of energy. Moreover, SOC itself combined with
a lattice distortion can induce spin-non-conserving hop-
ping processes among tz, orbitals directly or indirectly
due to mixing with other orbitals (e.g. via the eg or-
bitals of Ta or the p orbitals of O) and orbital polar-
ization effects (e.g. d-orbital deforms acquiring f-orbital
component). We will refer to these distinct processes
as Rashba type I (spin-conserving) and Rashba type II
(spin-non-conserving). We already speculated in Ref. [53]
that Rashba type II processes may play an important role
in the coupling to the soft mode in KTO. In this work,
we go beyond the methods in Ref. [53], analyzing type I
and type II processes on an equal footing.

We study the EPC to the zone-center modes of KTO
by comparing relativistic Density Functional Perturba-
tion Theory (DFPT) with a three-band model of spin-
orbit coupled tz, orbitals. Going beyond frozen phonon
computations, we compute the total electron-phonon ma-
trix resolved in pseudospin and projected onto KTO zone
center eigenmodes. All modes show comparable contri-
butions from intraband and interband processes, and the
coupling to the soft TO mode is found to be the largest.
For this mode, Rashba type II processes are particularly
relevant. The coupling to this mode induces dynamical
Rashba-like isotropic chiral angular momentum currents
to the highest electronic band. In contrast, for the two
lowest bands, the coupling becomes strongly anisotropic,
beyond the conventional Rashba effect. The DFPT pro-
tocol presented here allows for the extraction of coupling
coefficients for a given vibrational eigenvector, including
spin effects, and it is easily applicable to other systems.

The paper is organized as follows: in Section II, we
present the relevant electronic bands and zone-center
phonon modes in KTO and introduce the EPC using
symmetry arguments; our DFTP protocol and calcula-
tions are presented in Section III; the three-band micro-
scopic model that reproduces most of the DFPT results
is then discussed in Section IV, where we demonstrate
the importance of non-spin-conserving processes in the
EPC to the soft mode; we finally draw our conclusions
in Section V.

Il. ELECTRONS, PHONONS AND THEIR
COUPLING

A. Electronic properties

The electronic structure of KTO near the Fermi level
comes mainly from the 5d tg, electrons of Ta [54], with
a strong SOC splitting of the bands of around 400 meV.
In terms of the spinors of the three spin-1/2 tz, orbitals

cl, 4(k), ch_(k)) with pseudospin +. We will henceforth
refer to the doubly degenerate bands as n = 1, 2, 3 (blue,
red, green).

The transformation from the orbital basis to the band
oasis is particularly simple close to T. Because of the
SOC term, at the I point states separate into a j = 3/2

quartet (bands n = 1,2) and a j = 1/2 doublet (band
n = 3). Here j is an effective total angular momen-
tum resulting from the mapping of the three tz, orbitals
into p orbitals. Then the effective | = 1 orbital angular
momentum is added to the spin-1/2 angular momentum
[37, 39, 55, 56].

The following states diagonalize the Hamiltonian Ho

Here, the pseudospin index was chosen following the same

convention as in Ref. [39]. Note that to linear order in k,
there is no k dependence of the coefficients of the trans-
formation. As we shall see, the linear order is enough to
obtain the behavior of the EPC near I.

B. Vibrational properties and electron phonon
coupling

The electron-phonon Hamiltonian to first order in the
atomic displacements for the electronic spinor w},(k) for
phonon mode ) is:

1 f |
Hypo = N S wh(k + J) Nam, x(K; 20m - 9) Ag.
k,nm,qd
(4)

Here Ag. = dq,, + a ax is the phonon operator, and
the general EPC matrix reads

Anm a(R, @) = 9nm.(k,@)o0 + Gnm.av(k, gq) @ (5)

The pseudospin-independent coupling gnm,a(k,q) is
the conventional scalar electron-phonon matrix element.
The vector Gnm,,(k,q) represents instead a pseudospin-
dependent coupling, which has been considered less often
in literature.

In this work, we will carefully study the intraband
(n = m) and interband (n 4 m) EPC Anm,a(k,q) by a
particular post-processing of electron-phonon coefficients
computed with DFPT using QE in KTO. With respect
to our previous work [53], the advantage of DFPT over
frozen phonon is two-fold: 1) interband coupling terms
can be accessed, and 2) the computation to any q # 0
can be straightforwardly extended (without the need of
large supercells), which we will also explore.

In cubic KTO all 15 phonon modes at the zone center
are odd-parity modes, with irreducible representations
(irreps) 47), ® T2,. The three acoustic and nine optical
(di)polar modes belong to the Tj, irrep (J = 1), and
the three optical octopolar modes to the T>, irrep (J =
3). The threefold degeneracy of the irreps corresponds to
the three possible polarizations. At infinitesimal q, the
dipolar triplets get further split by long-range Coulomb
into one longitudinal mode and two transverse modes.

In the presence of inversion and time-reversal sym-
metries, for all these odd-parity zone center modes the
pseudospin-independent intraband term in Eq. (5) must
vanish, gnn,(k,q = 0)oo = 0, and the pseudospin-
dependent term can be finite instead, Gnna(k,q =
0)-o@ 40 (for the acoustic modes the coupling is linear
in q, so it does trivially vanish at g = 0). It would be de-
sirable to obtain the symmetry allowed form of the non-
vanishing intraband coupling Gp» (k,q = 0) to lowest
order in k.

The matrix Gnn,\(k,q = 0) generally depends on the
chosen basis 7. Indeed, because of Kramers degeneracy,
any U(2) rotation of the basis produces another allowed
asis [57, 58]. Near I’, the basis dependence of the matrix
elements can be circumvented by expressing the EPC in
erms of matrices representing the effective angular mo-
mentum operators Jars ys dz-

In the case of 7 = 1/2 [n = 3, Eq.(3)] this is particu-
arly simple as the system maps into a spin-1/2 system
with angular momentum j. In the O;), point group one
can build the following odd-parity objects combining k
and 3: Tiy ® Tig = Ary © Ey ® Ty © Toy. From the Ty,
erm, we obtain a dynamic Rashba-like coupling to polar
modes with polarization n [26, 36, 37, 59-61],

G33,7a (k,q = 0) = 93.7», (Kady — ye) hz (6)
where the angular momentum matrices j; are propor-
tional to Pauli matrices. In the presence of a lattice dis-
tortion, this form implies a splitting in pseudospin space
which is independent of the azimuthal angle ¢ defined in
Fig. 1(b). Here, we have defined the z axis to be par-
allel to the polarization of the phonon nr, without loss
of generality. This coupling is maximum (zero) when the
electronic momentum k is perpendicular (parallel) to the
polar axis of the mode nm. Analogously, for the T>,, term
we obtain a dynamic linear Dresselhaus-like coupling

G33,72,(k,q = 0) 0 = 93,72, (heiy + lite) nz (7)

to octopolar modes.

For the j = 3/2 manifold, within linear in k order, the
degeneracy problem is more severe as the states are four-
fold degenerate at [and split only quadratically in k by
the kinetic energy term in Ho. In contrast, the phonon
perturbation produces a linear-in-k splitting. Therefore,

in this limit, the phonon-induced mixing between bands
wl and wh cannot be neglected, and one should con-
sider 4x4 matrices. One can show that the n = 1 in-
traband term involves j* = j, + ijy to the third power
and its hermitian conjugate. In general, one can ex-
press the perturbation in terms of linear and third pow-
ers of j angular momentum matrices. As we shall see,
for j = 3/2, the general form departs from the conven-
tional isotropic Rashba/Dresselhaus forms in that the az-
imuthal angular dependence of the phonon-induced band
splitting becomes important. We call this anisotropic
Rashba/Dresselhaus-like EPC [53, 54].

In the following, we show how to compute the
symmetry-allowed EPC matrix elements for the T), and
To, modes via relativistic DFPT computations in KTO.

Ill. DENSITY FUNCTIONAL PERTURBATION

A. Definitions
We consider the standard Khon-Sham single-particle
Hamiltonian,
H=T+Vks (8)

where T’ is the non-interacting kinetic energy and Vxg is
the Khon-Sham potential containing the Hartree interac-
tion and exchange-correlation effects [62]. The Hamilto-
nian is diagonalized by the Bloch functions

Wank (T) = enn (T), (9)
where Unnk(r) have the same periodicity of the lattice
and 7 = + is the spinor index. We then consider a

phonon polarization vector eA,,(q), normalized in the unit
cell p, for the atom « along the Cartesian direction a,
which induces the following real-space displacement v:

in terms of phonon eigenvectors e,(q). In this way, we
divide the task of finding the electron phonon interaction
into two sub-tasks that can be performed independently:
i) compute the matrix elements Eq. (15) via DFPT ii)
find, from first principles or experimentally, the phonon
eigenvectors and frequencies to insert in Eq. (16).

This procedure guarantees a finer control of the
electron-phonon coupling, as one can decide afterwards
which is the more appropriate phonon eigenvector for a
given mode. This is useful in incipient ferroelectrics, as it
may not be a priori obvious what phonon eigenvector to
use due to intrinsic anharmonicities. We present a sim-
ple choice below, but our procedure can be generalized
to other choices of phonon eigenvectors.

Degeneracies— The electron-phonon coupling of Eq.
(16) is expected to contain pseudospin-dependent terms
in the form of Eqs. (6)-(7). The ab initio yf, in Eq. (15)
are determined using the ground state unperturbed Bloch
wavefunctions, which present degenerate subspaces Dink
and Drrtg (Dmk = 2 due to Kramer’s theorem and in-
version symmetry). This introduces a gauge freedom in
the choice of the wavefunctions; therefore, matrix ele-
ments in general depend on this choice of gauge. For
intraband q = 0 matrix elements, we can characterize
the electron phonon coupling by reporting the splitting
of the band for a given displacement, which is clearly
gauge invariant. For all other cases (finite q or inter-
band matrix elements), we will use the gauge-invariant
quantity,

B. Zone center modes (q=0)

The atomic displacements of the zone-center optical
modes in KTO can be given in terms of a complete

and Thy, modes, ( 568 In terms of atomic displacements

and Eq. (16) becomes

While there is a single possible mode of T>, symmetry
($4), the eigenvectors of the three T;,, modes in KTO
can in principle be any linear combination of S,, 52 and
S3 modes. Experimentally, however, it was established
the eigenvectors e*(q = 0) of the three zone center Ti,
modes to be almost pure 51,52 and S3 modes, from
lowest to highest frequency [64-66] (in Appendix B2 we
show that this is the case also from first-principles calcu-
lations). That is, the soft TO mode is a nearly ‘pure’ 9;
mode, with a vibration of the Ta against the oxygen cage.
In order to avoid the subtleties involved in a meaningful
computation of phonon frequencies and eigenvectors from
ab initio methods (in particular for modes with a strong
temperature dependence, such as the soft TO mode), we
will use the experimental frequencies and eigenvectors
Eq.(22) when computing the EPC Eq.(27). In particu-
lar, in the following, we will adopt at q = 0, wo, = 2.5

and $3 modes respectively and corresponding to the TO
modes measured in Refs. [65, 66].

We compute Eq. (27) for KTO at the zone center
q 0, with the computational parameters and pro-
cedures listed in Appendix B. Since the zone center
phonons of KTO are odd-parity modes, we do indeed
find, in agreement with the symmetry arguments leading
to Eq. (6) and Eq. (7), that for intraband processes and
q = 0, the pseudospin-independent processes in Eq. (5)
vanish, gun, (B8)09 = 0-

We can take the 2x2 EPC matrix for each band to be
diagonal by transforming to an appropriate basis at each
k point. Then the EPC takes the following pseudospin-
dependent form,

Anna(k) = Ginn, (k) - & = Gn,a(k)o3- (28)
Here, for ease of notation, we are using the same symbol
Ann,a(k) for the matrix written in the original basis and
he matrix in the diagonal basis. Note that the invariant
in Eq. (17) is defined so that, for the intraband n = m
and q = 0 case, it matches Gn,,(k) in Eq.(28).
The resulting intraband EPC coupling G,,,(k) for the
zone-center modes Si23.4 polarized along m = [001], and
or the perpendicular M — IT — X electronic momentum
k path are shown in Fig. 2. In agreement with previ-
ous frozen phonon computations [37, 39, 53], the EPC is
inear-in-k for k — 0. We have checked that these re-
sults are in agreement with frozen phonon computations
with a root mean square error < 0.01 meV (See Ap-
endix B3). As seen, the obtained coupling to the soft
S$; mode is indeed by far the largest. Also in agreement
with Eqs. (6) and (7) for band n = 3, the splitting has
he same initial slope as a function of the distance from
he origin. In contrast, bands n = 1 and n = 2 show a
strong anisotropy of the slope ({100] vs [110]), deviating
rom the conventional isotropic Rashba splitting.
Because of experimental constraints, the bands n = 1
and n = 2 are precisely those becoming populated upon
doping, as shown in Fig.1(a) for two illustrative Fermi
energies. We are not aware of experiments in which the
n = 3 band of KTO is populated, either in interfaces or
in bulk. Following the strong directional dependence of

he superconducting T;, in KTO-based heterostructures,
and aiming at a deeper analysis of EPC anisotropies of
bands n = 1 and n = 2 (coalescing to 7 = 3/2 quartet
at I), we now compute the EPC for three relevant FS
cuts, in the planes perpendicular to cubic direction [001],
110], and [111] at Ep; = 40meV, shown in Figs 1(b)-
(d). Here, we assume that the soft eigenmode at the
surface is still mostly S, [50], and we take the phonon
polarization perpendicular to the examined surface.
Figs. 3(a)-(c) show the intraband EPC for mode $;
computed along those three FS orientations, respectively,
as the azimuthal angle y varies along the FS of each band.
As seen, the intraband EPC has comparable strength for
the three different orientations. This implies that with-
out more detailed computations, no clear clues emerge at
this level for the orientational dependence of the T. on
surfaces.

In addition, the EPC shows a rather strong azimuthal
angular dependence, also seen in Fig 2(a) and previous
frozen phonon computations [53]. We anticipate that,
when compared to a three-band model (Section IV), it
will be necessary to consider Rashba-type-II processes
(spin-non-conserving) to capture the correct angular de-
pendence of the EPC to the Slater S; mode. This was
marginally discussed already in Ref. [53], where a frozen
phonon computation along high symmetry lines was al-
ready showing the different anisotropic behavior of the
Rashba splitting for the various modes.

A great advantage of DFPT calculations is having ac-
cess to the interband EPC matrix elements, unlike the
frozen phonon method. In the interband channel, the
pseudospin independent terms gnm,,(k,q = 0)oo with
n #™m, can now also be finite. We indeed find the inter-
band matrices to be of the general form given by Eq. (5).
We show in Figs. 3(d)-(f) the corresponding invariants
using Eq. (17) for the lowest bands, gi2(k) and go1(k),
along the FS for the same three orientations [001], [110]
and [111], respectively. As seen, these interband matrix
elements are of the same order of magnitude as the intra-
band matrix elements in panels (a)-(c) in the same figure.

meV and the FS of the planes are shown in Figs. 1(b)-(c). The
phonon polarization is perpendicular to the plane examined.
The interband matrix elements gym,5,(k,q = 0) with m #n
for the same orientations are shown in panels (d)-(f). For
interband, we show the matrix element for the scattering of
a fermion from the FS of one band to the other band at the
same k point (since gq = 0), which is outside the FS.

Since we are considering q = 0 processes, we show the
matrix element for the scattering of a fermion from the
FS path of one band to the other band at the same k
point, which will be outside the FS. Because of this, the
two matrix elements are different (nm = 12 in blue, and
nm = 21 in red).

For completeness, we present the same results for the
other two T),, modes, Sy and $3, and the T>,, mode Sy
in Appendix B4. Also in this case, despite the strong
angular dependence, there is no evident dominance of
coupling in any direction.

k along [100] and q = (q0,0,0) with go = 0,+0.1,+0.2 (in
units of 7/a).

C. Finite q modes

Within the DFPT framework, it is relatively easy
to access electron-phonon matrix elements also at fi-
nite g. However, differently from the zone-center case,
the momentum dependence of the phonon frequency
Ww, and of the phonon eigenvector e2,(q) can in prin-
ciple have a significant impact on the small-q behav-
ior of Anm,,(k,q). Since the experimental determina-
tion of the eigenvector of the KTO soft mode at finite
q has not been done, we concentrate on the gq depen-
dence of the matrix elements 7*@,(k,q), by computing
JagxAnm,s(k,q) approximating eX,(q) with the zone-
center eigendisplacement of Eq. (22). We show in Fig. 4
hese intraband \/%qi911/22,5, (kK + q/2,q) and interband
Va@qigi2/21,5, (+ 4/2,q) terms for a S; mode polarized
ong [001], k along the perpendicular [100] direction,
and q = (qo, 0,0) || k with gg = 0, 0.1, 0.2 (in units of
m/a).
In general, the presence of a finite g introduces both
the dependence of 7“ (k,q) upon the angle between k +
q/2 and k — q/2, and on their moduli |k + q/2|,|k—q/2|.
These dependencies shift the minima of gnn,,(k+¢q/2, q)
away from k = 0 to k = —q/2 at finite q, signaling
the presence of trigonometric factors. Equivalently, the
minima of gnn,(k,q) always appear at k = 0 at finite
q. This is consistent with the fact that in the presence
of time-reversal symmetry |gnn,a(k, q)| = |gnn.a(—k, @)|
must hold. Additional dependencies on |q| are instead
much milder up to the largest q analyzed [Fig. 4]. This is
probably a general feature of the EPC in this system, but
its systematic study will be left for future investigations.

Finally, we note that finite q calculations are contin-

ct

2

uous to q = 0 ones, signaling the absence of long-range
components in the electron-phonon coupling of the an-
alyzed modes, as expected for TO phonons [51, 67, 68].
Given the weak |q|-dependence found for small doping, it
is reasonable to take the g = 0 results as representative
of the interband electron-phonon coupling.

IV. THREE-BAND MODEL OF DYNAMIC
RASHBA-LIKE COUPLING

In the following, we show how the EPC to polar modes
in Eg. (4) emerges when considering induced electronic
hopping processes in real space in a three-band relativis-
ic model with the tz, orbitals of Ta [39]. Indeed, in the
resence of a polar distortion, new terms appear in the
electronic Hamiltonian. Identifying the dominant ones
can help to understand the momentum structure of the
EPC (Fig 3), determine the relevance of spin-conserving
type I) ef) spins non-conserving (type II) processes, and
inpoint the microscopic processes that lead to the sym-
metry form in Eq. (6).

We now introduce a three-band model (spin-orbit cou-
led tz, orbitals) to describe the coupling between the
electrons and polar phonons in this system. In the pres-
ence of a polar mode A to linear order in the distortion,
here are new induced hopping terms ty,j,,(k,q). The
EPC Hamiltonian reads,

q
Herc = SS gh (k+ 5 ung a(R, Doser

(k— J Aa
(29)

with Pauli matrices oj representing electronic spin-
independent (j = 0) and spin-dependent (j = 1,2,3)
hopping processes between orbitals and v on neighbor-
ing Ta sites.
To identify the most important induced hopping terms,
we performed a g = 0 frozen phonon computation to-
gether with a Wannier projection of the electronic struc-
ure with and without the lattice distortion for the three
polar modes. We employed maximally localized Wannier
‘unctions [69] with a polar phonon oriented along [001].
The Wannier projection was restricted to the tg, mani-
fold, so all the indirect processes via different orbitals are
effectively incorporated in the projection. For further de-
ails, see Appendix A 2.

We find strong differences between the odd-parity in-
duced terms by each polar mode Sy, in KTO. The fol-
lowing four hopping and their symmetry-related terms
etween nearest-neighbor (NN) Ta atoms dominate the
response,

tyzo(k) = —2it, sinky, — tzeo(K) = 2it, sink, (30)
tea (k) = 27y,4 Sin ky, tyy,2(k) = —27y,a sink, (31)
tey2(k) = —2tu,psinky, teyi(k) = 2tu,psink,, (32)
tea3(k) = —2tu,csinky, tyz3(k) = 2tucsink,. (33)

tivistic processes is represented by gray arrows, only shown
for y > 0 for clarity. Notice that the flipping or not of the
spin depends on the spin state of the electron considered. We
schematically illustrate the processes for spins polarized along
the z direction.

Note that we dropped the gq dependence and X subscript
to simplify the notation. The amplitude ¢, in Eq. (30)
corresponds to the previously studied spin-independent
(type I) process [37, 53], and it is shown in Fig 5(a).
The other three terms in Eqs. (31)-(33) correspond to
spin-dependent (type II) processes. The induced term in
Eq. (31) is shown in Fig 5(b) and describes a spin-non-
conserving intra-orbital hopping with amplitude tTy,4.
Fig 5(c) describes also a spin-non-conserving term, in-
volving two different tg, orbitals instead [Eq.(32)]. The
last type II term [Eq. (33)] in Fig 5 (d) is an interorbital
hopping with spin-dependent amplitude t,,c, opposite
for each spin projection along z. The analogous terms
for a polar phonon along [100] and [010] can be straight-
forwardly derived using a permutation of the orbitals.
Notice that Eq. (4) and Eq. (29) represent the same

functions. The ty hopping is obtained from a linear-in-k fit to
the EPC obtained in a non-relativistic DFPT calculation (see
Appendix A 3) and using the experimental phonon frequencies

and the latter in the orbital basis. The matrix elements
Anm and tyy,j ave related by a unitary transformation
and are derivatives of an energy with respect to atomic
displacements multiplied by the harmonic oscillator char-
acteristic length lg, = \/h/(2wqy/4y) [c.f Eqs. (15), (27)]
and therefore have units of energy. Likewise, the induced
hopping parameters have units of energy, and their value
depends on the choice of the phonon frequency, while
their ratios reported below do not.

Table I shows the ratio of the induced type II hopping
amplitudes 7,,,; to the type I amplitude t,, for the three
polar modes $) in KTO [Egqs.(18)-(20)] obtained from
the Wannier projection. While the ratios are quite small
for the Sy mode, they become intermediate for $3, and
more importantly, of the order of one for Sj. This in-
dicates that the spin-non-conserving terms in the EPC
vertex for the Slater mode Sj are as relevant as the spin-
conserving inter-orbital t,, term. This is consistent with
the much stronger intraband interaction for all bands in
Fig. 2(a) compared to panels (b) and (c), which cannot
be reconciled solely with the mode-dependent ¢,, mag-
nitudes. The magnitude of t,, is discussed in the next
subsection, as it was determined by a different method.

We use now the three-band model of tz, orbitals with
SOC [Eq. (1) and Eq.(29)] to show how the spin-non-
conserving terms determine the momentum structure and
strength of the polar EPC.

A. Rashba type I processes

Let us start by neglecting SOC (€ = 0) in Eq. (1)
and doing the analysis for the high-symmetry direction
k = [100] to obtain analytical expressions. The tight-
binding model Hp = >>, ho(k) of the three spin-1/2 ty,
orbitals takes the form

ho(€ =O, ke) = Do oli he) Ey (ke)ooeulke) (34)
Me

with energy dispersions
E,(k) = 2t2(1 — cosk) (35)
E,(k) = Ez(k) = 2(t1 + 2t3)(1 — cos k) (36)

Again, oo is the identity matrix acting on the electronic
spin-3 sector of the tg, orbitals. Hence, along this k=
[100] direction, we have a doubly degenerate band with
orbital character 4. = x and a fourfold-degenerate band
with orbital character jp = y,z. The same holds for the
equivalent & = [010] direction, but interchanging the x
and y orbital character.

Without SOC, a polar phonon can only induce the in-
terorbital spin-independent processes t,, [Eq. (30)]. In
the electronic basis y, in Eq. (34), these induced hop-
ping elements for a phonon polarized along [001] become
pure interband terms, mixing the orbitals w = x, y in the
lower band with the 4 = z member of the upper band
manifold:

Hppo = S 2it, [ph (k) sin(k.)ooy.(k) (37)
k

(Type I)

Note that the double spin degeneracy is preserved (the
spin sectors up and down are still completely decoupled),
ie., the polar term only acts in the band sector, as an
interband spin-conserving coupling.

The ¢, parameter could in principle be directly ob-
tained from the relativistic Wannier projection discussed
above, which includes this nearest-neighbour hopping
amplitude. Instead, we can obtain an effective t, pa-
rameter taking into account further Ta neighbors, be-
yond NN, in the spirit of tight-binding models (for details
see Appendix A3). We perform a non-relativistic DFPT
computation for a polar mode $3. In this case, the sec-
ond term in Eq. (5) vanishes and Eq. (37) contributes
only to the first term, ie., Anm,(K) = Ynm,,(k)o0 for
n#m. By fitting the DFPT results with the model [Eq.
(34) and Eq. (37)], we obtain the effective t, values in
Table I.

The $2 mode shows the smallest EPC amplitude, more
so when considering \/wo,tu. This may not be so surpris-
ing, since from Eqs. (18)-(20), one can see that this is
the only mode preserving the Ta-O bond. We have also
checked that in the presence of SOC the t,, parameters
from Wannier do not change significantly, the change for
the soft $; mode being less than 1%.

Switching on the SOC, we can now project the spin-
conserving EPC model Eq.(37) into the relativistic elec-
tronic spinors wi (k) in Eq. (2). It is instructive to an-
alyze first the problem in the small k limit, neglecting
quadratic and higher order in k corrections, where the
electronic basis Eq. (3) diagonalizes Ho. Projecting the
matrix elements of the type-I EPC model Eq. (37) in-
duced by the parity-breaking phonon to the SOC basis
in Eq. (3) we obtain,

For band 3, the polar phonon induces a pseudospin de-

pendent intraband Rashba-like term 3, recovering the
expression in Eq. (6) derived from symmetry arguments
for a Tj, mode, with coupling constant Sty. This leads
to the conventional isotropic Rashba splitting in the pres-
ence of a static lattice distortion.
A similar result is found for the intraband term of
band 1, but, in addition, the phonon also induces
pseudospin-dependent Vy, interband matrix elements,
with a Rashba-like coupling ¥13 and a Dresselhaus-like
coupling for Ji2 and 23. Notice that because of the
degeneracy of bands 1 and 2 in this k limit, what is
called “intraband” and “interband” is basis dependent,
and the 4x4 matrix with the interband interaction has
to be taken into account to obtain the splitting.
an construction, we considered only type I processes in
q. (37). Therefore, all EPC terms in Eqs.(39)-(41) are
eeorionl to the spin-conserving hopping t,, involving
inter-orbital amplitudes [Eq.(30)]. In this case, SOC is
only needed to modify the electronic structure (Hom non-
relativistic to relativistic), but it is not critical for the
existence of a finite electron-phonon vertex [37, 39, 60,
70). In the absence of SOC, the electron-phonon vertex
does not vanish but simply becomes a spin-conserving
interband term, as in Eq. (37).
From the analytically derived EPC expressions in
Eqs.(39)-(41) one can already see that in general the re-
sulting interband ¥,,, and intraband V,, couplings are o
he same order of magnitude (~ t,), in agreement with
he ab initio results in Fig. 3. One can show analytically,
going to quadratic order in k, that the type I EPC mode
also displays a vanishing EPC for band n = 2 for kz, = 0
and ky = 0 [53], which is certainly not the case for the ab
initio EPC, as can be read from Fig. 2, where the n = 2
and shows, at small k, a sizable linear-in-k intraband
EPC along k, for all polar modes.
Interestingly, as we shall see, this model yields an
anisotropic Rashba splitting, which is a necessary condi-
ion to explain the DFT results. However, the obtained
angular dependence is qualitatively different for some o
he modes. To illustrate more clearly the problem with
neglecting type II hopping processes in the EPC, Fig. 6
compares the type I model using Eq. (1) and Eq. (37)

tations (full lines in all panels) along the same FS k-

ing EPC matrix Anm,,(k) [Eq. (5)] for a mode X, from
which the intraband (left column) and interband (right

column) EPC strengths are obtained, and compared to
DFPT results. The modes are polarized along 7 || [001],
and the EPC is shown as a polar plot, i.e., along the FS
of bands n = 1 (blue) and n = 2 (red) in the perpen-
dicular kz-ky plane, for Erp; = 40 meV, illustrated in
Fig. l(a). Note that bands 1 and 2 are no longer degen-
erate [Fig. 1(b)], unlike in the linear-in-k approximation
in Eq. (3), due to the mixing by the kinetic energy terms
in Ho at quadratic order in k.

As we already pointed out above and in Ref. [53], the
type I model only captures some of the EPC features ob-
tained by ab initio in KTO. As seen in Fig. 6(b), both
intraband (left) and interband (right) EPCs of mode
S_ are beautifully reproduced by this three-band EPC
model, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The EPC
to the polar mode $3 obtained by the model in Fig. 6(c)
shows bigger disagreement with its DFPT counterpart,
although the general features are still qualitatively cap-
tured. Finally, the model severely fails when describing
the EPC to the soft mode $j, as shown in panel (a). In
particular, we highlight the substantial qualitative dif-
ference found in the intraband contribution, where the
maxima and minima appear inverted for both n = 1 and
n = 2 bands.

The virtue of the type I EPC model for mode Sy and
its shortcomings for mode S$; (and to some extent 93)
are not so surprising, if one bears in mind the mode-
dependent relevance of the induced non-spin-conserving
terms 7,,,; discussed in the beginning of this Section, and
listed in Table I. In the following, we show how these
type II terms can considerably affect the EPC structure
(and strength) of the three polar modes.

B. Rashba type I and type II processes

Let us now consider the EPC model by including also
the spin-non-conserving terms in Eqs. (31)-(33). We can
again project the matrix elements in Eqs. (29)-(33) in-
duced by the polar phonon to the SOC electronic basis
Eq. (3), as in Eq. (38). The corresponding intraband and
interband induced elements, listed in the following, con-
tain now besides t,,, the spin-non-conserving terms T,,;:

As seen, the spin dependent 7,,,; amplitudes also lead to
Rashba-like EPC terms at small momenta [e.g. Eqs. (42)-
(44)]. Contrary to the type I Rashba EPC arising from
the spin-independent t,, amplitude explored before, 7,,,;
are proportional to SOC (they must vanish without rela-
tivistic effects). We thus call the type of EPC originating
from T,,; spin-dependent vertex, Rashba type IT EPC.
It is interesting to note that the induced terms t,,, Ty,
Tu,B and Tu,c [Eqs. (30)-(33)] enter the intraband ¥,, and
interband Unm EPC of the various bands in distinct ways.
For example, the coupling for band n = 2 [Eq. (43)] has

only spin-non-conserving contributions 7,,,;, while bands
n = 1,3 have contributions from the spin-conserving ty,
term as well. This already indicates that the relative
strength of the induced type II terms 7,,,; with respect to
the type I term t,, for a given polar mode determines the
final momentum structure of the EPC.

band (left) and interband (right) EPC by the type I and

mode, along the same FS k-path used in the DFPT cal-
culations (full lines in the same figure). As seen, overall
the qualitative match between the three-band model and
the ab initio results is now very good also for modes 5;
and $3, in particular for the interband matrix elements.
Also, it is clear that the different weight of the type II
induced terms in each polar mode (Table I) affects both
the overall EPC strength (e.g. 51 vs S3, despite having
similar ¢,,,/Wy) as well as the EPC momentum structure
(e.g. Si vs $2.3).

A strength of this framework is that, being a lattice
model, it is not restricted to the small-k regime. We show
in Fig. 8(a) the comparison between DFPT and the EPC
of the three-band model for a high Ep2 = 240 meV case
indicated also in Fig. 1(a)]. As seen, even when parts of
he F'S extend close to the BZ edge (along the [100] and
symmetry equivalent directions) the agreement between
he EPC by the three-band model (dashed lines) and ab
initio computations is very good.

As a consequence, another notable strength of the EPC
model Eq. (29) is that one can straightforwardly map out
he three-dimensional (3D) k-space EPC, bypassing the
computational effort required by relativistic DFPT and
similar ab initio methods. Figs. 8(b)-(c) show an exam-
le of the EPC projected on the 3D FSs for Ep, = 40
meV and Ep. = 240 meV, respectively, for a $, mode
olarized along [001] (black arrow). The corresponding
2D cuts on the k, = 0 plane were shown in Fig. 7(a) and
Fig. 8(a). As seen, the FS acquires anisotropy in mo-

12

mentum space as Ep is increased, from the quasi-sphere
shape in (b) to the three interpenetrating ellipsoids ori-
ented along [100], [010], and [001] in (c). The struc-
ture of the EPC evolves accordingly, showing very large
anisotropy in (c), with stronger (weaker) coupling in ar-
eas close to (far from) the zone center, where the effect
of SOC (kinetic term) dominates [39]. These types of 3D
maps can be used to study phenomena where the EPC
may play an important role, such as transport, supercon-
ductivity, or ferroelectric states.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have studied the EPC to the zone-center phonons
in KTO, which are odd-parity modes. We focused mainly
on the polar 7}, modes, particularly on the soft TO
mode, employing a combination of relativistic DFPT and
a three-band microscopic model. Our computations go
beyond the frozen phonon method, where only intraband
terms can be studied, and we find that interband matrix
elements are of the same order of magnitude as intraband
elements. Therefore, interband terms cannot be a priori
neglected when addressing KTO, and its importance in a
physical process must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

The DFPT results can be understood in terms of
a three-band model for the spin-orbit coupled tz, or-
bitals. After projecting onto the relevant modes, we
can study intraband and interband EPC and disentan-
gle spin-conserving type I and spin-non-conserving type
II processes. The spin-orbit-assisted EPC results to be
an isotropic dynamical Rashba effect for band 3 (7 = 3)

and an anisotropic one for bands 1 and 2 (j = 3).

We find that, for the soft TO mode (51), spin-non-
conserving hopping terms are as large as spin-conserving
terms (Tu,4 = 1.08tu, Tuc = 0.44t,), and need to be
included to obtain the correct form of the anisotropy
of the EPC in this system. Therefore, SOC is impor-
tant not only in the mixing of orbitals for the electronic
band structure, but also in determining their coupling to
the phonon modes. The match between the three-band
model and DFPT results is very good for all three modes,
particularly for interband matrix elements. The discrep-
ancy found for intraband matrix elements is largest in
the EPC of modes with significant spin-non-conserving
processes S; and S3 [Fig.7(a) and (c)]. Since the origin
of these terms is relativistic, it could be due to restricting
the model to the t2, manifold, and an obvious extension
would be to include the e, manifold. Another possibility
would involve sub-leading terms beyond neighboring Ta
sites in Eqs.(30)-(33), which, according to the Wannier
projection, are individually smaller, but their cumulative
role could be quantitatively appreciable.

The three-band model works surprisingly well also be-
yond small k. As such, it also allows for a 3D map of
the k-space EPC, which can be useful for the study of
phenomena involving EPC, such as transport, supercon-
ductivity, or ferroelectricity. Indeed, we find the cou-

ling to the soft TO mode to be rather large, making
he Rashba-like coupling a promising pairing mechanism
in KTO. The role of interband coupling in the Cooper
yhannel should be considered in this case.

The electron-phonon coupling projected on FS cuts
erpendicular to different crystalographic orientations
shows anisotropies. However, we did not find an evi-
dent dominant feature that could explain the different
yehavior of exposed sample surfaces regarding super-
onductivity. That said, one should take into account
hat a small change in the EPC can be strongly am-
ified due to the exponential dependence of T. on the
EPC at weak coupling. Therefore, the explanation of
he observed anisotropy on T,, requires detailed compu-
ations on the surface that go beyond our present scope.
One step in this direction would be to consider surface
phonons [50, 71].
Our DFPT protocol was built to be general and al-
ow for the extraction of model coefficients for a given
phonon mode. By computing, in fact, the first-order co-
efficients of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian for each atom
and direction, we can project them onto the appropri-
ate mode basis. This circumvents the eventual numeri-
cal problems arising when computing degenerate phonon
modes, which will be, in general, a mixture of the S)
modes. This method is quite general and may be applied
to any other system with even or odd parity vibrational
modes.

while in Eq. (A2), « # v. The SOC gap at the zone
center in Fig. l(a) is given by 3€ = 415.9 meV. The
parameters are overall consistent with those given in Ref.
[53], whereas the small differences can be ascribed to the
slightly larger lattice constant adopted here as well as
to different implementations of DFT in QE (used in this
paper) and VASP (used in Ref. [53]).

2. Wannierization

We projected the fully relativistic band structure of
KTO on maximally localized Wannier functions (ML-
WFs) [69] as implemented in Wannier90 [72]. Conduc-
tion bands of cubic KTO calculated with QE have been
projected on spinor Wannier functions localized on Ta
atoms with real angular functions yz, xz, ry, correspond-
ing to spin-1/2 tag orbitals |jo) introduced before, with
[= 2,y,2, respectively. FS cuts have been then calcu-
lated using the Wannier interpolation procedure imple-
mented in Wannier90 [69, 72] along three different slices
in the Brillouin zone, perpendicular to [001], [110] and
[111] directions; each slide has been sampled on a uni-
form 100x100 k-point grid for two values of the Fermi
energy (Ep; = 40 meV and Ep2 = 240 meV) defined
from the conduction band minimum.

We also construct a real-space tight-binding (TB)
Hamiltonian in the basis of MLWFs (MLWF-TB), which
automatically includes also terms beyond next-nearest
neighbors. Since indirect processes via different or-
bitals/atoms are effectively included when downfolded to
the tg, manifold, SOC effects are accounted for by both
a local term (effective atomic SOC) and by complex hop-
ping interactions. SOC-induced effective parameters can
be identified by comparing the MLWF-TB Hamiltonians
constructed from ab initio calculations with and without
SOC. The local SOC has the form given in Eq. (1) with
a coupling constant €ypwr = 139.2 meV, while SOC-
induced hopping terms are of the order of a few meV and
can be thought of as being effectively absorbed in the e
fective SOC of the three-band tight binding model Eq.
(1). For completeness, we also provide the TB-MLWF
parameters up to next-nearest neighbors, tM™WF = 473.1
meV, tEWF = 23.2 meV, tMEWF = 81.5 meV, and
tYLWF = 13.8 meV. It is worth mentioning that the
TB-MLWF Hamiltonian includes hopping terms beyond
next-nearest neighbors, which can be thought to be effec-
tively absorbed in the three-band TB model of Eq. (1),
explaining the different values of TB parameters.

The identification of induced hopping terms arising
from polar phonons has been achieved within a q = 0
frozen-phonon approach. We constructed three distorted
structures following the S, modes along the [001] direc-
tion with fixed amplitude u = 0.002 A to guarantee
linearity of the coupling to polar modes [53]. The band
structure with and without SOC of each distorted cell
has been projected on Ta tag MLWFs. By analyzing

he computed MLWF-TB Hamiltonians, we can single
out the odd-parity hopping interactions induced by the
owering of symmetry, as well as their non-relativistic or
relativistic origins. Such frozen-phonon induced hopping
arameters ern can be related to the EPC entering in
Eq. (29) exploiting the linearity of the coupling regime,
hence by multiplying fener with the ratio Ig—o,,/U.

When SOC is turned off, the largest induced hopping
for the Slater 5; mode is the nearest-neighbor one giv-
ing rise to type I EPC parametrized by t,. We find
hat next-nearest-neighbor processes also contribute to
ype I EPC: such contributions are subdominant for the
S$; mode, while for Sy and $3 modes they are com-
arable in strength with the NN process. The type I
EPC parameters evaluated from non-relativistic MLWFs
out taking into account only the nearest-neighbor con-
ribution are tu(S1) = 35.9 meV, tu(S2) = 1.7 meV
and t,($3) = 2.6 meV. Remarkably, they display the
same order of magnitude of type I EPC effective pa-
rameters ¢, evaluated by fitting non-relativiste DFPT
results with the model Eq. (37) (thus taking into account
beyond-NN contributions) and listed in Table I. By in-
cluding contributions arising from next-nearest-neighbor
induced hoppings in the TB-MLWF Hamiltonian, the
type-I EPC parameters are modified as t,,(S1) = 48.9
meV, t,(S2) = 2.8 meV and t,,(53) = 3.9 meV. Finally,
the inclusion of SOC introduces subleading modifications
to the type I spin-conserving term, namely t,,($1) = 36.1
meV, t,($2) = 1.7 meV, and t,,(53) = 2.8 meV, when
considering NN hoppings. At the same time, several new
odd-parity spin-dependent hopping terms mediated by
SOC appear in the distorted structures.

In order to keep the TB modelization as simple as pos-
sible, while still capturing the essential physics qualita-
tively, we singled out the leading spin-dependent hopping
processes between nearest neighbors that are sketched in
Fig. 5. They can be interpreted as arising from indi-
rect processes involving spin-orbit-coupled different or-
bitals/atoms that are downfolded into the spin-1/2 ta,-
only manifold. For instance, the process sketched in
Fig. 5(b) between two Ta atoms across a bridging O atom
in the Ta’-O-Ta® bond may arise from SOC mixing O-

p states with opposite spin via the sequence dy. + ine

3. Extract type I parameter from non-relativistic

We can do the same analysis as in Subsection IV A but:

Along this k direction, we have three doubly spin-
degenerate bands. Considering the spin-
independent inter-orbital matrix elements induced in the
presence of a polar phonon, we obtain again pure inter-
band terms for the type I model:

which is analogous to the result in Eq. (37), i.e. interband

Doing a non-relativistic DFPT computation in KTO
for a polar $; mode (i = 1,2,3) polarized along 001, we
indeed obtain interband terms along k = kx andk = ky
within DFPT, shown in Fig. 9 (orange line) for the three
polar S; modes. From the fit of these results at small
k with Eqs. (37) and Eqs. (A5) we extract the type I
induced amplitude t,, for each mode, listed in Table I.

V=a (left axis) and corresponding pressure P (right axis,

value ap=0 = 1.007 aexp (green stars), corresponding to an
ideal zero pressure.

Appendix B: Computational details
1. Density functional theory calculations

We first computed the optimum value of the cell pa-
rameter a of KTO. In Fig. 10 we show the computed total
energy Eo, of KTO as a function of volume V = a? (left
axis, black) and the corresponding computed pressures
P (right axis, red). We fitted the curve E,.twith the
Birch-Murnaghan potential [73] and P with its deriva-
ive. We then took the cell parameter corresponding
0 zero pressure, indicated by ap=o in the plot. We
found ap—o = 1.007 dexp = 4.01754 (green stars), where
dexp = 3.9885 A is the experimental value [74]. This re-
axation procedure was done using an automatic mesh
0 x 10 x 10, checking that the results for and apo were
unchanged using a tighter grid of 14 x 14 x 14. In both
cases, Ejo_ remained the same up to the 6 digit (in Ry
units) and the pressure computed in QE at apo was
found to be P = 0.56 kbar, low enough to have a reliable
convergence in optical phonons. In all our calculations
we then used apo as the cubic cell parameter and an
automatic mesh 10 x 10 x 10 for the self-consistent cal-
culations.

To further ease the calculations, we give as input
in the self-consistent QE calculation the 56 k-points
with the correct weights corresponding to the automatic
10 x 10 x 10 automatic grid, plus the k—path (with zero
weight) along which we want to compute the EPC: high-
symmetry-lines M —T — X are given with a total of 400
equidistant points, FS are instead computed via the Wan-
nier interpolation procedure explained in Appendix A 2.

We used fully relativistic (scalar relativistic) PAW
pseudopotentials for calculations with SOC (without

SOC) [75] and the generalized gradient approximation
for the exchange and correlation functional (PBE) [76].
Convergence thresholds on total energy and forces were
taken respectively as 5-10~° and 107°. Cutoffs on wave-
functions and charge densities were respectively 55 and
550 Ry. Convergence threshold for self-consistency of
electrons was 10~!*, with a maximum number of itera-
tions for step 80 and mixing factor 0.4. The threshold for
self-consistency in the phonon computation was 1074.
For electron-phonon calculations, we used an in-house-
modified version of QE, which allows for the evaluation
of Eq. (17) for any choice of the phonon eigenvector. In
particular, we print the electron-phonon on the cartesian
basis set, i.e., the 7f0 (k,q) of Eq. (27). This is obtained
by linking the displacements of each irreducible repre-
sentation to the Cartesian one. These tasks are all per-
formed by the ph.x program, which first performs the
standard DFPT calculation of the linear response and,
after convergence, prints the electron-phonon. The con-
traction of the 7{ (k,q) matrices with any given phonon
eigenvector is then easily performed in postprocessing.

2. Ejigenfrequencies and eigenmodes

Decomposing the eigenvectors e2(q = 0) computed by
QE in the basis ($1, $2, $3, S41) we get the following
coefficients

Tru: (0.966, 0.034, 0,0) (4.2meV)
Tru: (0.034, 0.965, 0,0) (22.7 meV)
Try: (0,0,1,0) (63.5 meV)

Tou: (0,0,0,1) (32.3 meV)

where we have also added their corresponding frequency
in meV.

The eigenvectors and frequencies of the TO phonons
determined by hyper-Raman scattering experiments at
room temperature [65}:

Tin: (0.991, 0.012, 0.0027, 0.) (10.0 meV)
Tin: (0.011, 0.994, 0.,0.) (24.7 meV)
Tin: (0.002, 0, 0.998, 0.) (67.7 meV)
To, : (0,0,0, 1) (34.6 meV)

Therefore, the phonon spectra at the zone center com-
puted by DFPT give results very similar to the exper-
imentally reported eigenvectors (nearly pure 5, modes)
and frequencies. When computing Eq. (27) we used the
experimental frequencies in Ref. [65] except for the soft
TO mode, which has a strong temperature dependence
and we used instead its low temperature experimental
frequency 2.5 meV, reported in Refs. [50, 66].

3. Check against frozen phonon calculations

The intraband DFPT results match the EPC obtained
by a frozen phonon method [39, 53]. For that, we com-

The result is in agreement with degenerate perturbation
theory to first order in wu, i.e., interband processes can
only affect higher order in wu quantities, not the break-
ing of the degeneracy. Hence, to linear-in-u, the EPC
obtained from DFPT and frozen phonon are formally ex-
act, and we find this to be respected up to a precision of
0.005+0.05 meV (root mean square of < 0.01 meV) for
displacements of u = 0.001 A.

4. Orientation dependence for optical modes

We show for completeness our DFPT results for modes
So, 53, S4 in Fig. 11 for FS cuts at Eri; = 40meV
perpendicular to the three orientations [001], [110], and
111]. The strength of the EPC has a strong azimuthal
angular dependence in all cases, as seen for the S; mode
Fig. 3]. Similar to the soft mode, the strength observed
along the three FS cuts are comparable in all modes,
making it difficult to claim anything from our calcula-
ions about the orientation dependence of T,. As we
underline in our conclusions, however, in the weak cou-
pling regime small differences are strongly enhanced by
he exponential dependence. A detailed computation of
T.. goes beyond the scope of this work and is left for fu-
ure investigations.
