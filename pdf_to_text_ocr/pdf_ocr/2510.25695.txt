Abstract— We report over 3 kV breakdown voltage and ultra-low leakage (011) B-GazO3 power
devices utilizing Schottky barrier engineering and high-permittivity («) dielectric (ZrO2) field
plate. The (011) orientation of B-Ga2O3 enabled low background doping and thick drift layers
which are promising to support kV-class vertical B-Ga2O3 power switches. The Schottky barrier
engineering was performed with a composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) anode contact to take
advantage of the enhanced reverse blocking capabilities enabled by PtOx while allowing low turn-
on voltage by the interfacing thin Pt layer. We also performed a systematic study using a co-
processed Pt/(011) B-GazO3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) on the same wafer. The bare SBDs
revealed a breakdown voltage of ~1.5 kV, while the field-plate Pt/(011) B-Ga203 SBDs achieved
an increased breakdown voltage of 2.75 kV owing to the edge field management. Further
enhancement of the breakdown voltage was achieved by tunneling leakage management using
composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) Schottky contacts that ultimately enabled breakdown voltage
of 3.7 kV for the field-plate diodes. Remarkably, the Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) Schottky contacts
maintained similar turn-on voltage as the Pt/(011) B-GazO3 SBDs. The combination of efficient
tunneling leakage management by composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) contacts with similar turn-
on voltage, edge field reduction by high-« dielectric ZrOz field plate, as well as the advantageous
material properties offered by (011) B-Ga2O3 demonstrate a promising strategy for developing

ultra-low leakage and multi-kV class vertical (011) B-Ga203 power devices.

B-Ga2O3 has acquired widespread interest for compact, high-power semiconductor devices
with its ultrawide-bandgap (UWBG) of ~ 4.8 eV, controlled shallow dopants, and projected high
critical breakdown field (~8 MV/cm).'° Particularly, the availability of melt-grown B-Ga2O3 native
substrates has created a unique opportunity for developing low-cost, large-scale production of
UWBG power devices. With the continued progress in device design and fabrication techniques,
promising device performance has already been demonstrate with vertical B-Ga2O3 power diodes
employing different field management techniques, such as field-plates,”"" trench structures, !>!
guard rings,”° deep etch,”!*4 and ion implantation.?> However, most of these reported B-Ga203
power devices utilized halide vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE)-grown nominally 10 um thick (001)
oriented B-Ga203 epilayers with background doping of low 10!° cm®. This background doping is
higher compared to the concurrent SiC power device technology where very low doping (< 5x10!4
cm?) in thick drift layers has enabled more than 20 kV power devices.’ Hence, to scale the B-
Ga2O3 power devices toward higher voltage rating, thicker drift layer with controlled lower
background doping remains a fundamental requirement. Moreover, it has been reported that the
(001) B-Ga2O3 epilayer growth facilitates favorable formation of line-shaped dislocation
defects.”*? These dislocations act as killer defects for vertical power devices as they can create
leakage path across drift layer and degrade the reverse breakdown voltage.!7°?

To overcome these challenges, there has been recent exploration of homoepitaxial B-Ga2O03
growth in alternative crystal orientations, such as (011), which demonstrated reduced incorporation
of the killer dislocation defects because the dislocation traps form parallel to the (011) plane.”*”°
This is promising to minimize the dislocation-assisted leakage across the vertical current transport
direction of the (011) B-Ga2O3 power devices. However, due to the early stage of research, the
fundamental electronic properties and Schottky barrier height (SBH) with vertical (011) B-Ga2Os
Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) is sparsely available. Moreover, vertical (011) B-Ga2O3 Schottky
power devices with efficient field management are yet to be reported. Such an investigation is
critically important to assess the potential of (011) B-GazO3 in high-voltage electronics since
Schottky diodes are the primary rectifier switches for B-Ga2O3 power devices.

To achieve the desired high-voltage in vertical B-Ga203 SBDs, efficient field management is
also a vital requirement since the electric field gets crowded at the contact peripheries which leads

to premature device failure. Besides, in Schottky diodes, tunneling leakage at the metal/B-Ga203

junction is another performance-limiting factor that restricts the maximum electric field at
Schottky junction to ~3.5 MV/cm for a Schottky barrier height of 1.5 eV.2>3° Hence, engineering
the anode contact is also fundamentally required to minimize tunneling leakage and early
breakdown of the B-GazO3 Schottky junction.

In this work, we investigated the performance of high-voltage vertical (011) B-Ga2O3 diodes
by integrating edge field reduction using high-permittivity («) dielectric (ZrOz) field-plate. The
high-« dielectric field-plate has been demonstrated as an efficient approach to reduce electric field
within dielectric due to the significantly higher permittivity of dielectric than B-Ga203 while
supporting more uniform electric field distribution at edges.7*3!>? Moreover, we investigated the
SBDs with engineered anode contacts of composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm)/B-Ga2zO03 Schottky
contacts, based on our prior studies on (001) B-Ga203 epilayers,” which was demonstrated to merge
the benefits of both improved reverse blocking properties offered by PtOx and low turn-on voltage
enabled by the thin Pt at interface. Here, we performed a systematic study of extracting Schottky
contact properties using the basic SBDs formed on the (011) oriented B-Ga2O3 epiwafers using Pt
and composite Pt cap/PtO;/Pt (1.5 nm). With integration of high-« ZrOz field-plate, we further
compared the performance of the composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) SBDs with a co-processed Pt
one where the composite Pt cap/PtO;/Pt (1.5 nm)/B-Ga203 SBD provided ultra-low leakage and
significantly higher breakdown voltage of 3.75 kV compared to that of Pt (2.75 kV). Moreover,
this enhanced breakdown performance was achieved by the composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm)
SBDs maintaining similar turn-on voltage as the Pt counterparts. Hence, our work demonstrates
the utilization of advantageous material properties of (011) B-Ga2O3 as well as device design
strategies with engineered Schottky contacts and high-« dielectric field plate to achieve high-

performance multi-kV vertical (011) B-Ga2O3 power switches.

Schottky contact. (c) The extracted SBH from 1/C?-V analysis for both SBDs, with the inset

depicting the extracted doping concentration.

The vertical B-Ga203 SBD were fabricated on commercially available halide vapor phase
epitaxy (HVPE)-grown (011) B-GazO3 with 20 um drift layer and nominal doping ~ 5x10 cm?,
grown on 400 um thick Sn-doped B-Ga2Os substrate (doping ~ 5x10!* cm%). The SBD structures
consisted of 100 tm diodes with a 20 um field-plate. The device fabrication started with backside
Ohmic contact formation by treating the backside with BCls-based reactive-ion etch (RIE)
followed by e-beam evaporation of Ohmic metal stacks, Ti (30 nm)/Au (150 nm). The Ohmic
metal alloys were subsequently annealed at 470°C for 1 minute by rapid thermal annealing (RTA).
Afterwards, the Schottky contacts were patterned for fabricating 100 um diameter anode contacts.
The plain Pt contacts were formed by e-beam evaporation. On the other hand, the composite Pt
cap/PtO;/Pt (1.5 nm) contacts were created by depositing the thin Pt layer to 1.5 nm with e-beam
evaporation, followed by a low-power (55 W) reactive ion sputtering of PtOx using Pt and Ar:O2
flux of 10:5 sccm. The composite contacts were ended with a continuously sputtered Pt cap
deposition without breaking the vacuum. After the Schottky contact fabrication, the field-plate
dielectric stack was formed by a 200 °C atomic layer deposition (ALD) of a thin (~9 nm) ZrO2
layer followed by sputter deposition for thick (~226 nm) ZrO. The interfacing thin ZrO2 was
formed by ALD to protect the surface from plasma-induced damage effects during the subsequent
thicker ZrO2 deposition by sputtering. The deposited ZrO2 was reported to have a dielectric
constant of ~26 from our prior works.”* The ZrO dielectric was then opened using a BCl-based
RIE etch, followed by a dilute HF wet-etch process, to expose the Schottky contacts for field-plate
formation. Finally, a field-plate with 20 pm field-plate length (Lrp) was formed using the
previously described sputter deposition of Pt cap/PtOx for both anode contact cases, Pt and
composite Pt cap/PtO;/Pt (1.5 nm), as shown in Figs. | (a, b).

The fundamental SBD properties of the (011) B-Ga2O3 were extracted using capacitance-
voltage (C-V) and current density-voltage (J-V) measurements. The 1 MHz C-V analysis was used
to extract the SBH and doping concentration in both composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) and Pt
SBD cases as shown in Fig. 1 (c). A slightly higher doping concentration of ~ 5x10!° cm? was
obtained for the Pt SBD compared to that of the composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) that

demonstrated a doping concentration of ~3.8x10 cm?.

This difference in the doping
concentration is within the doping variation range across the epiwafer as specified by the
manufacturer. The 1/C?-V analysis was further used to extract the SBH from bare SBDs for both
contact cases, obtained as 1.60 eV and 1.72 eV for the Pt and composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm)
contact SBDs, respectively (Fig. Ic).

The forward J-V characteristics demonstrated excellent transport characteristics of both SBDs
with near unity ideality factor, with or without incorporating field-plate, as shown in Fig. 2 (a).
Considering thermionic emission as the dominant transport mechanism at room temperature, the

Schottky barrier height (q®) of the Pt/B-Ga203 SBDs were extracted as 1.50 eV and 1.54 eV for
without and with field-plate, respectively. On the other hand, the Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm)/B-Ga203

Fig. 2. (a) Forward transport characteristics of the 100 um diameter SBDs formed with composite
Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) and Pt contacts, both with and without 20 um field plate configuration.
The SBDs exhibited near unity ideality factor for all cases, and (b) The differential specific on-

resistance (Ron,sp) and the extracted minimum specific on resistance for all diode cases.

SBDs demonstrated a slightly higher SBH, obtained as 1.60 eV and 1.56 eV, for without and with
field-plate, respectively. With this slight increase in SBH, we observed that the Pt cap/PtO,/Pt (1.5
nm) contacts did not substantially increase the turn-on voltage compared to the Pt counterparts.
The diode turn-on voltage (Von), evaluated at the forward current density of Jon = 1 A-cm7,® was
obtained as 1.20 V for both field-plate Pt and Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) SBDs, respectively, while
the bare SBDs demonstrated a Von of 1.16 V and 1.24 V for Pt and composite Pt cap/PtO,/Pt (1.5
nm) anode contacts, respectively. This trend of the Von is in line with the SBH extracted from the
J-V analysis.

The minimum differential specific on-resistance (Ron,sp) was also analyzed from the forward J-
V characteristics. The Pt SBDs demonstrated a similar minimum Ron,sp for both cases, without and
with field-plate, extracted as 18.79 mQ-cm? and 19.09 mQ-cm”, respectively (Fig. 2b). Similar
trend was observed for the composite Pt cap/PtO,/Pt (1.5 nm) SBDs, with minimum Ronsp
appearing as 24.62 mQ-cm™ and 24.06 mQ-cm* for diodes without and with field-plate,
respectively (Fig. 2b). It is to be noted that the higher minimum Ronsp in the composite Pt cap/PtO-
x/Pt (1.5 nm) SBDs can be explained from their extracted ~24% lower net doping concentration

(~3.8x10'5 cm) compared to the Pt ones (~5x10!> cm’) as shown in the inset of Fig. 1 (c). As the
on-resistance directly corresponds to the drift layer doping, the commensurate increase of the on-
resistance is expected for a lower-doped drift layer region.*

The SBDs were subsequently characterized to extract their reverse breakdown voltage (Vor),
where breakdown was considered at the point of catastrophic failure. The devices were fully
submerged in FC-40 Fluorinert dielectric liquid to prevent air breakdown during testing. Without
a field plate, the bare SBDs with Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) and Pt contacts revealed breakdown
voltage in the range of 1.4-1.6 kV, which was limited by the edge field crowding effects (Fig. 3).
With integration of the field-plate, the breakdown voltage of the Pt SBDs was obtained as 2.75 kV,
while the composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) SBDs did not demonstrate any breakdown up to 3 kV
in addition to maintaining an ultra-low leakage current of ~4x10-7 A-cm”. The 3 kV is the
maximum reverse bias limit of our parametric analyzer at lowa State University (ISU).

Hence, to determine the breakdown voltage of the field-plate composite Pt cap/PtO;/Pt (1.5
nm) SBDs, we performed the reverse bias measurements on the same SBDs by accessing the
parametric analyzer at University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), which is capable of
implementing reverse bias beyond 3 kV. It was observed that the composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5
nm) SBDs device finally reached catastrophic breakdown at ~3.7 kV. It is to be noted that the
reverse current density of the field-plate Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) SBDs remained below the noise
level of the UCSB tool of ~10° A-cm until the diodes experienced the catastrophic breakdown.
The superior breakdown voltage also enabled the field-plate composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm)
SBDs to achieve a higher Baliga’s Figure of Merit (BFOM) than the Pt counterparts, extracted as
0.567 GW/cm? and 0.396 GW/cm”, respectively.

We also compared the reverse leakage current of the Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) SBDs on (011)
B-Ga2O3 with the reported vertical (001) B-Gaz03 SBDs_ that demonstrated a breakdown voltage
of beyond 3 kV (Fig. 4).'§!°7633' Our fabricated vertical (011) B-Ga2O3 SBDs with composite Pt
cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) contacts demonstrated order of magnitude lower leakage current at 3kV
compared to the existing reports on (001) B-Ga2O3 SBDs.!*!9°33 The reduced background doping
concentration in the (011) orientation compared to (001) oriented epilayers in combination with
our engineered Schottky contact with composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) and field-plate enabled
the significant reduction of the leakage current which will be promising for low off-state loss high-

voltage devices.

To gain insights about the electric field distribution at breakdown, we performed a 2D Silvaco
Atlas simulation of the field-plate composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) SBDs at the breakdown
voltage Vor = -3692 V (Fig. 5a). The Silvaco simulation revealed a punch-through electric field
profile at the breakdown voltage with a parallel plane peak electric field of 2.53MV/cm. The
maximum electric field appeared at the field plate edge in the ZrO2/B-GazOs interface, extracted as
~5 MV/cm (Fig. 5b). It is to be noted that we performed forward breakdown characteristics of the
ALD ZrOz film using vertical metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) diode structure which
demonstrated the breakdown field of ALD ZrOz2 to be within 4.1-4.5 MV/cm. Hence, the field-
plate Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) SBD breakdown voltage was likely limited by the breakdown of the
ALD ZrO? at interface as the ZrO2/B-Ga20Os3 interface electric field reaches ~5 MV/cm. Further
improvement of the device breakdown voltage can be achieved by integrating additional edge field

management strategies and utilizing extreme permittivity dielectric in the field-plate.

In summary, we report (011) vertical B-GazO3 high-power Schottky diodes fabricated with
high-permittivity (1c) dielectric ZrOz field-plate and Schottky barrier engineering with composite
Pt cap/PtO;/Pt (1.5 nm) contacts. The devices enabled excellent reverse bias performance with
over 3 kV breakdown voltages with ultra-low leakage current. Moreover, compared to the
conventional Pt Schottky contacts, the composite Pt cap/PtO/Pt (1.5 nm) allowed significant
improvement in reverse blocking capabilities with similar turn-on voltage and lower leakage,
which offers opportunities of low-loss, high-voltage power devices. Thus, our work demonstrates
the potential of (011) B-Ga2zO3, benefitted from the thick drift regions with low background doping
as well as tailored device fabrication strategies that will be promising for efficient multi-kV class

vertical power switches.
