Abstract

The study demonstrates the capabilities of a vector-based approach for calculating stoichiometric
coefficients in chemical equations, using black powder as an illustrative example. A method is proposed
for selecting and constraining intermediate interactions between reactants, as well as for identifying final
products. It is shown that even a small number of components can lead to a large number of final and
intermediate products. Through concrete calculations, a correlation is established between the number of
possible chemical equations and the number of reactants. A methodology is proposed for computing all
possible chemical equations within a reaction system for arbitrary component ratios, enabling the
derivation of all feasible chemical reactions. Additionally, a method is developed for calculating the
chemical composition for a fixed set of reactants, allowing for the evaluation of the set of products
resulting from all possible chemical interactions given a specified initial composition.

Introduction

Balancing chemical reactions is one of the fundamental components of modern chemistry, without
which it is impossible to perform any technological calculations related to chemical processes. Although
this problem has been studied for over 150 years, the currently available methods for determining
stoichiometric coefficients still do not meet the requirements of scientific and technical practice.
Contemporary methods are either too simplistic to solve complex equations or too complex to be
implemented in practice [1, 2].

A key distinction of the vector-based approach to calculating the material balance of complex
chemical processes is its ability to compute the complete set of linearly independent reactions between
reactants and products, regardless of the number of components and without imposing constraints on the
presence of reactants or products with identical compositions [3, 4, 5].

The capabilities of this approach can be demonstrated for various reaction systems, but a
particularly illustrative example is the reaction system formed during the combustion of black powder,
which consists of only three components: approximately 75% potassium nitrate, 15% charcoal, and 10%
sulfur [6].

This composition is considered traditional; however, there are numerous variants of black powder
that differ in the proportions of the components (sometimes by as much as 5%) as well as in the presence
of additional substances and additives [7, 8].

Depending on the type of carbonaceous material used, different forms of powder are obtained:
black powder (pure carbon), brown powder (from brown coal), or chocolate powder (from coal tar). The
addition of a hydrogen-containing component increases the energetic output of the powder, making it
suitable for artillery applications.

In theory, sulfur can be entirely replaced with organic substances — for example, potassium nitrate
and sugar (75% potassium nitrate, 25% sugar). Carbon can also be fully substituted with another carbon-
containing compound, such as potassium carbonate (55% nitrate, 18% sulfur, and 27% potassium
carbonate). To further increase combustion energy, aluminum is sometimes added to black powder.

In any case, the initial mixture must contain an oxidizing agent (potassium nitrate) and a reducing
agent (sulfur, carbon, or organic substances).

Thus, the actual reactive mixture for black powder may contain not merely three components, but
significantly more:

KNOs — an oxidizing agent, serves as a source of oxygen. It is sometimes used in combination
with other nitrates - NHsNOs, NaNOs, Ca(NOs)2, Ba(NOs)2 — which influence the burning rate.

C — a reducing agent, responsible for the formation of explosive gases. In the presence of
sufficient oxygen, it is oxidized to CO2; in oxygen-deficient conditions, to CO.

S — a reducing agent, necessary for binding potassium in the form of K2S, or in excess oxygen
conditions, in the form of K2SO..

H20 — may appear during storage (due to hydration) or be intentionally added to reduce the
burning rate; it may also be present as part of other nitrates.

C,HmO — organic substances such as resins, paraffins, waxes, sugar, and wood powder may be
added both to modify the combustion process and to alter physical properties (e.g., reduce caking,
hygroscopicity, facilitate granulation, etc.).

Al-— used primarily to increase combustion temperature.

In the traditional composition of black powder, it is assumed that the main combustion products
are only three substances: CO: (carbon dioxide), N2 (nitrogen), and K2S (potassium sulfide).

However, it is logically reasonable to assume that, in reality, the addition of hydrogen-containing
compounds — such as organic substances, ammonium nitrate, or nitrate hydrates — results in the formation
of water as a product of chemical reactions. Incomplete combustion of carbon compounds leads to the
formation of CO, and in the case of insufficient potassium ions, carbonates, sulfates, and sulfites may also
form.

This is supported by experimental investigations of the combustion products of black powder, yet
such outcomes are still scarcely represented in the form of a comprehensive list of possible chemical
interactions, as their calculation using traditional methods is nearly infeasible.
Identification of Reactants and Interactions in the Reaction System

The principal advantage of the vector-based approach lies in its ability to generate all possible
linearly independent chemical equations (i.e., combinations of reactants with a constant number of
atoms in both the initial and final states) for a system with an arbitrary number of reactants.

The number of such equations increases approximately in geometric progression relative to the
number of participating reactants. Although this number can be theoretically estimated using mathematical
methods, in practice, it is significantly lower due to constraints of a chemical nature.

For example, actual chemical reactions are usually limited in the number of participating
reactants; it is extremely rare for both oxidizing and reducing agents to appear simultaneously among the
products; and reactants and products should not possess identical compositions (though they may be
isomers or substances in different physical states).

Therefore, the most effective method for investigating a complex reaction system is the gradual
increase of its complexity.

In the case of black powder, a reasonable starting point is the traditional composition of the initial
reactants, which ensures the formation of only the principal combustion products.

KNO3,C,S=> K2S,CO2,N2.
Such a composition can be achieved only at a single ratio of the initial reactants.
2KNO3+3C+S=3CO2+N2t+K2S

A critically important parameter for the practical application of black powder is the volume of
gases produced during the chemical interaction, which, for this particular composition of the starting
material, amounts to AV = 89.6L- mol of reaction mixture or AV = 332 cm?-g™? of the initial
components.

In cases of poor mixing of the components (e.g., coarse granularity, inadequate homogenization of
the reactants), reactions involving only two components may occur. Such interactions are also possible
when the ratio of the initial reactants deviates from stoichiometric values, meaning that the actual volume
of combustion gases may differ from the calculated values. This variation is determined by incomplete
combustion reactions, as well as by interactions between intermediate species and the initial reactants
(reactants) or final products.

In the case of potassium nitrate (KNOs) deficiency, incomplete oxidation of carbon may occur,
leading to the formation of CO.

If sulfur (S) is deficient, potassium carbonate (K2COs) may form.

In the case of carbon (C) deficiency, potassium sulfate (K2SO.) and potassium sulfite (K2SOs)
may form.

If both carbon and sulfur are deficient, sodium nitrite (NaNOz) and molecular oxygen (O2) may be
produced.

KNO3,C,S=> K2S,CO2,N2+CO,K2CO3,K2SO3,K2SO4,K2NO2,02
Thus, as a result of black powder combustion, at least 15 stoichiometrically feasible chemical
reactions are possible. However, some of these can be excluded due to the actual incompatibility of certain
reaction products (e.g., O2 and K2SOs, S and O2, CO and Oz, etc.), which ultimately leaves only 12
reactions.

2KNO3+S=N2+K2SO4+O2
2KNO3+C=N2+K2CO3+1.502
2KNO3+2.5C=1.5CO2+N2+K2CO3
2KNO3+C+S=CO2+N2+K2SO4
2KNO3+1.5C+S=1.5CO2+N2+K2S03
AKNO3=N2+2K2NO2+402
2KNO3+4C=N2+3CO+K2CO3
2KNO3+3C+S=3CO2+N2+K2S
4KNO3+4C=4CO2+N2+2K2NO2
2KNO3+3C+S=N2+3CO+K2SO3
4AKNO3+8C=N2+8CO+2K2,NO>
2KNO3+6C+S=N2+K2S+6CO

At elevated temperatures, intermediate products interact both with each other and with the initial
reactants. At temperatures above 400 °C, potassium nitrite (KNOz) is formed. Above 440 °C, potassium
oxide (K2O) is produced. Above 500°C, potassium sulfide reacts with oxygen to form sulfate (K2SO.).
Above 900 °C, the sulfate reacts with carbon to yield sulfide and carbon monoxide (CO). Above 600 °C,
sulfite undergoes disproportionation into sulfide and sulfate. Above 300 °C, sulfur reacts with oxygen to
form sulfur dioxide (SOz). Above 400 °C, sulfur dioxide reacts with oxygen to form sulfur trioxide (SOs).
Also above 400°C, sulfur dioxide reacts with carbon to produce elemental sulfur and carbon dioxide
(COz).

For such a complex reaction system, a total of 198 chemical reactions are possible, but this set can
be reduced by retaining only 5 substances as final products.

KNO3,C,S+CO2,K2S,CO,K2CO3,K2S03,K2SO4, KNO2,K20,SO2,SO3=>K28,CO2,N2 +K2CO3,K2SO4

The addition of organic substances leads to their decomposition with the formation of hydrogen,
water, and carbon. At 250 °C, organic compounds decompose with the release of Hz. At 300 °C, aromatic
compounds begin to form, having a general empirical formula of (CH),. At 400 °C, elemental carbon (C)
starts to form. At the same temperature (400 °C), hydrogen and organic compounds react with oxygen to
form H20.

When water is present in the mixture — either as a result of organic compound decomposition or
due to ambient moisture — nitrogen oxides, sodium hydroxide, and sulfuric acid are produced.

Above 100°C, sodium nitrite decomposes in the presence of water to yield NO2, NO, and K20.
The resulting K20 immediately reacts with SO2, SOs, and CO2 to form K2SOs, K2SO., and K2COs,
respectively. K2COs, in the presence of sulfur oxides, further reacts to form K2SO3 and K2SOs. In turn,
K2SOs, in the presence of oxygen or SOs, converts into K2SO.. The addition of aluminum or iron leads to
the formation of their respective oxides.
Thus, the actual combustion process of black powder is significantly more complex than a single
chemical reaction, and requires a specialized computational approach and methodology.

Calculation of Reactions for Arbitrary Component Compositions

The traditional formulation of black powder consists of three reactants and is designed to yield
three primary products.

KNO3,C,S=>K2S8,CO2,N2
For such a composition of the reaction mixture, only one reaction can exist.
2KNO3+3C+S=K2S+3CO2+N2

However, if additional possible products are included — those that arise from deviations from this
composition and are terminal (final) under maximum temperature conditions — the system expands by at
least four more substances.

KNO3+C+S=>K28,CO2,N2+K20, O2, K2SO4, K2CO3

As a result, five additional reactions are obtained, which correspond to mixtures with an excess of
certain components relative to the traditional composition.

2KNO3=N2+K20+2.502
2KNO3+S=N2+O2t+K2SO4
2KNO3+C=N2+1.502+K2CO3
2KNO3+2.5C=1.5CO2+N2+K2CO3
2KNO3+C+S=CO2+N2+K2SO4

It should be noted that this is an exclusive list of chemical equations involving these components.
Since potassium oxide cannot exist freely in an environment containing other acid-forming components, it
can be excluded from the set of final products—along with oxygen, which can exist only as a result of the
decomposition of pure potassium nitrate. As a result, only three reactions remain that lead to complete
consumption of the initial reactants. All other compositional ratios will involve intermediate products.

This does not mean that such reactions are impossible or do not occur in practice, but the amount
of intermediate products should decrease over time, in contrast to terminal products.

When paraffins, fats, or waxes (represented in the reaction as CHz) are added to the reaction
mixture, an additional terminal product, H2O, appears.

KNO3+C+S+CH2=>K28,CO2,N2+K2SO4, K2CO3+H20
As a result, additional reactions are obtained:

3KNO3+1.5S+CH2=CO2+1.5N2+1.5K2SO4+H20
2KNO3+S+2CH2=K28+2CO2+N2+2H20
3KNO3+2.5CH2=CO2+1.5N2+1.5K2CO3+2.5H20
4KNO3+C+S+3 CH2=K2S+3CO2+2N2+K2CO3+3H20
4.4KNO3+C+3CH2=1.8CO2+2.2N2+2.2K2CO3+3H20
S5KNO3+2.5S+3CH2=K2S+3CO2+2.5N2+1.5K2SO4+3H20
S5KNO3+S+4.5CH2=K28+3CO2+2.5N2+1.5K2CO3+4.5H20
6KNO3+2S+3CH2=2CO2+3N2+2K2SO4+K2C0O3+3H20
6.8KNO3+S+6CH2=K2S+3.6CO2+3.4N2+2.4K2CO3+6H20
8KNO3+C+38+3CH2=3CO2+4N2+3K2SO04+K2CO3+3H20
14KNO3+7S+6CH2=K2S+6CO2+7N2+6K2S04+6H2O

When carbohydrates (with the general formula CH2O) are added to the reaction mixture, a similar
set of possible reactions is obtained, but with a different composition of reaction products.

KNO3+C+S+CH20=>K28,CO2,N2+K2SO4, K2CO3+H20

2KNO3+S+CH20=CO2+N2+K2SO4+H20
2KNO3+S+3CH20=K28+3CO2+N2+3H20
3.2KNO3+C+3CH20=2.4CO2+1.6N2+1.6K2CO3+3H2O
4.4KNO3+S+6CH20=K2S8+4.8CO2+2.2N2+1.2K2CO3+6H20
SKNO3+C+1.5S+3CH20=3CO2+2.5N2+1.5K2SO4+K2CO3+3H20
6KNO3+2C+S+6CH20=K2S+6CO2+3N2+2K2CO3+6H20
6KNO3+S+6CH20=4CO2+3N2+K2S04+2K2CO3+6H20
6KNO3+S+8CH20=K28+6CO2+3N2+2K2CO3+8H20
TKNO3+2.5S+5CH20=4CO2+3.5N2+2.5K2SO4+K2C03+5H20
8KNO3+4S+6CH20=K2S+6CO2+4N2+3K2S04+6H20
14KNO3+S+18CH20=K2S+12CO2+7N2+6K2CO3+18H2O

To increase the energetic output of black powder, aluminum is sometimes added, resulting in the
formation of only one new product in the reaction mixture: Al,Os.

KNO3+C+S+AIl=>K2S,CO2,N2+K2SO4, K2CO3+H20+A1203

Since it, like sulfur and carbon, acts as a reducing agent, the number of new reactions increases by
only three.

2KNO3+C+2Al=N2+K2CO3+ALO3
3KNO3+1.58+2AI=1.5N2+1.5K2SO04+A1.03
2KNO3+S+4Al1=K2S+N2+2Ab03
Thus, although deviations from the traditional composition of black powder may lead to the
formation of a large number of intermediate products in the final reaction mixture, the introduction of
constraints that allow only stable products can significantly reduce the number of possible chemical
interactions between reactants.

To compute equations involving intermediate products, it is sufficient to include them in the list of
reactants and products; however, this results in the number of possible reactions increasing to several
hundred.

Calculation of Reactions for a Fixed Component Composition

The presented calculations may be of interest for theoretical studies; however, for practical
applications, it is more useful to compute the composition of the reaction mixture for a given ratio of
components in the initial mixture, or to determine the required ratios of initial components to achieve a
desired composition of the reaction mixture.

A fundamental principle of the vector-based approach is that, for a fixed ratio between reactants,
only a finite number of reactions exist that satisfy the material balance between the initial reactants and the
products of chemical interaction. This number is exhaustive and may, in some cases, be zero. However, if
the initial reactants are included among the products of the interaction, then there will always exist at least
one set of product ratios that satisfies the material balance of the chemical transformation.

For this purpose, it is advisable to include the initial reactants as part of the final products, and to
represent black powder as a composite substance with a fixed composition.

[(KNO3)2C3$](KNO3)nCmSk=K2$,CO2,N2+K2$04, K2xCO3+H20+KNO3,C,S

where [(KNO3)2C3S] — the classical composition of black powder;
n, m, k — deviations in the quantities of individual components.

This approach makes it possible to investigate the effect of excess amounts of each reactant on the
composition of the combustion products of the reactant mixture. In turn, this enables the calculation of the
volumes of gases produced by each reaction, normalized to the mass of the initial reaction mixture
(cm?/g).

For example, with an excess of 0.5 mol of KNOs — ({(KNO3)2C3S](KNO3)os) — the following
reactant ratios can be obtained:

A[(KNO3)2C3S1](KNO3)0.s=2.75K2S+11C02+5N2+1.25K2S04+K2CO3 (AV = 280 cm? +g)
12[(KNO3)2C3$1](KNO3)o.s=22CO2+15N2+K2SO4+14K2CO3+11S (AV = 215 cm? g~4)
4[(KNO3)2C3S1](KNO3)o.s=5.5CO2+5N2+4K2S04+K2CO3+5.5C (AV = 183 cm?: g~1)

For an excess of 1 mol of KNOs, the following reactant ratios can be obtained.

2.67[(KNO3)2C381 ](KNO3)=K2S+6.67CO2+4N2+1.67K2SO4+1.33K2CO3 (AV = 241 cm? - g~4)
2[(KNO3)2C3S1 ](KNO3)1=4CO2+3N2+K2SO4+2K2CO3+S (4 AV = 211 cm? + g~1)
2[(KNO3)2C3S1](KNO3)1=3.5CO2+3N2+2K2SO4+K2CO341.5C (AV = 196 cm?- gt)
2.5[(KNO3)2C381](KNO3)2=5.5CO2+4.5N2+2.5K2804+2K2CO3+KNO3 (AV = 190 cm? - g~+)
1.25[(KNOs)2C3$1](KNO3)4=2.75CO2+2.25No+1.25K2SO4+K2CO3+3KNO3 (AV = 133 cm3 - g~1)

Similar calculations can be performed for excess amounts of sulfur.
With a sulfur excess of 0.5 mol relative to the traditional composition, it is possible to achieve its

complete utilization.

1.33[(KNO3)2C3$1]S0.s=K2S+4CO2+2N2+K2SOx (AV = 353 cm - g~2)
2[(KNO3)2C3$1]80.s=4CO02+3N2+K2$O04+2K2CO3+28 (AV = 282 cm3 - g~4)
[(KNO3)2C381]So.s=1.5CO2+1.SNo+1.5K2SO4+1.5C (AV = 188 cm3« g~4)

However, when the excess is increased to 1 mol, there are no stoichiometrically feasible reactions

that allow for complete utilization of sulfur.

2[(KNO3)2C381]S1=1.5K2S+6CO2+3No+1.5K2SO4+S (AV = 334 cm? - g~1)
1.33[(KNO3)2C3S1]S2=K2S+4CO2+2N2+K2SOs+2S8 (AV = 317 cm3 - g~1)
2[(KNO3)2C381]S1=4C02+3N2+K2SO4+2K2CO3+3S8 (AV = 260 cm? - g~+)
2[(KNO3)2C3S81]S1=3CO2+3N2+3K2SO4+3C+S (AV = 223 cm? - g™1)
2[(KNO3)2C3S$1]S2=4CO2+3N2+K2$O4+2K2CO3+58 (AV = 235 cm? +g)
[(KNO3)2C381]S2=1.5COo+1.5N2+1.5K2SOg+1.5C+1.58 (AV = 201 cm3 - g~?)

When excess carbon is added, it also remains unreacted or leads to the presence of unconsumed

sulfur.

2.67[(KNO3)2C3S81]Co.s=1.67K2S+8CO2+4N2+K2S804+1.33K2CO3 (AV = 365 cm? - gt)
6[(KNO3)2C381]Co.s=13CO2+9N2+K2S04+8K2CO3+5S (AV = 298 cm? - g~4)
2[(KNO3)2C3S81]Co.s=3.5CO2+3N2+2K2S04+K2CO3+2.5C (AV = 264 cm? - g~1)

An increase in excess leads to an increase in the number of possible chemical reactions.

8[(KNO3)2C381]C1=7K2S+28CO2+12N>+K»SO4+4K2CO3 (AV = 397 cm? - g~4)
12[(KNO3)2C38 1]Ci=10K2S+4 1 CO2+18N2+2K2SO4+6K2CO3+C (AV = 391 cm3 - g~1)
2[(KNO3)2C381]C1=K28+6CO2+3N2+2K2CO3+S8 (AV = 357 cm3 - g~1)
4[(KNO3)2C381]C1=K2S+9CO2+6N2+3K28O04+2K2CO3+5C (AV = 298 cm3- g~+)
4[(KNO3)2C381]C1=9CO2+6N2+6K2CO3+C+4S (AV = 298 cm? g~1)
2[(KNO3)2C3S1]C1=3.5CO2+3N2+2K2$04+K2CO3+3.5C (AV = 258 cm? « g~1)

However, further increase in the excess once again reduces their number.

[(KNO3)2C381]C2=2.25CO2+1.5N2+1.5K2CO3+1.25C+S (AV = 286 cm3- g~+)
2[(KNO3)2C381](KNO3)0C2=3.5CO2+3N2+2K2SO4t+K2C03+5.5C (AV = 248 cm? + g~1)
When carbohydrates (e.g., sugar) are added to the traditional composition, it is observed that their
excess leads to incomplete consumption of the initial reactants. However, the unreacted component may
be carbon, sulfur, or both reactants simultaneously.

[(KNO3)2C3S 1](CH20)=K2S+3CO2+N2+H20+C (AV = 394 cm3 -g~1)

T[(KNO3)2C3S1](CH20)=K28+9CO2+7N2+6K2S04+7H20+19C (AV = 259 cm3 « g~?)
4[(KNO3)2C381](CH20)=4.5CO2+4N2+3K2S04+K2CO3+4H20+10.5C+S (AV = 246 cm3 - g~1)
[(KNO3)2C3S81](CH20)=CO2+N2+K2S04+H20+3C (AV = 237 cm3 - g~4)

The analysis of the presented reactions reveals several important points. First, each possible
composition of the initial reactants results in multiple chemical reactions. Second, these reactions produce
different specific volumes of gaseous products (AV). Third, for most reactions, this volume is lower than
that of the traditional composition, although there are also reactions that lead to a higher amount of
gaseous products.

The analysis further shows that the presence of potassium sulfide among the reaction products
increases the gas volume, while the presence of sulfur results in a higher specific gas yield than carbon.

This, in turn, implies that the final composition of the reaction products cannot be predicted solely
based on the initial composition of the reaction mixture, as the products are formed simultaneously
through different reactions, and their relative proportions are determined by factors such as temperature,
pressure, and time.

Calculation of Reactions for Fractional Component Compositions

For practical calculations, it is more convenient to use an initial composition with fractional
coefficients. This allows for the computation of all possible reactions and all possible combinations of
products for a given initial composition, under the assumption that only stable reaction products are
formed.

The number of reactions can be quickly determined based on the weight composition of the
powder and the molar masses of the reactants.

where

w(X) is the mass fraction of substance X in the mixture (KNOs, C, S), expressed as a percentage
(%).

The coefficients 101, 12, and 32 correspond to the molar masses of the substances (KNOs, C, S)
(in g/mol).

For the classical formulation — 75% KNOs, 15% C, 10% S — we obtain [(KNO3)2C3S)].

And according to the transformation scheme
[CKNO3)2C3S1]J=>K28,CO2,N2+K2SO4, K2CO3+H20+KNO3,C,S

only a single possible chemical equation is obtained.
[CKNO3)2C381] = K2S+3CO2+N2

For the traditional composition of 75% KNOs, 15% C, and 10% S, we obtain [((KNO3)2C3.4So.],
which does not precisely correspond to the theoretical stoichiometric ratio of the components.

[(KNO3)2C3.4S0.8]=>K2S,CO2,N2+K2S04, K2CO3+H20+KNO3,C,S
As a result, we now obtain three possible chemical equations with additional products.

1.25[(KNO3)2C3.480.8]=1.88CO2+1.25N2+1.25K2CO3+1.13C+S8
5[(KNO3)2C3.480.8]=5.5CO2+5N2+4K2S04+K2C03+10.5C

With an excess of sulfur in the powder composition — 75% KNOs, 10% C, 15% S — the
resulting mixture has the composition [(KNO3)2C22S13], which deviates even further from the classical

formulation.

[(KNO3)2C2.281.3] =>K28,CO2,N2+K2S04, K2CO3+H20+KNO3,C,S

and also results in the presence of three chemical equations.

3.33[(KNO3) 2C2.281.3]=2K28+7.33CO2+3.33N2+1.33K2S04+8
3.33[(KNO3) 2C2.281.3]=3.33CO2+3.33N2+3.33K2S04+4C+S
5[(KNO3) 2C2.281.3]=7CO2+5N2+K2S04+4K2CO3+5.5S

The addition of hydrocarbons (paraffin, oil, fat) introduces hydrogen atoms into the system. For
the composition 75% KNOs, 10% C, 15% S, and 4% paraffin, the resulting chemical composition is

([CXNO3)2C2.381(CH2)o.8]

[(KNO3)2C2.3S 1(CH2)0.8] =>K2S,CO2,N2+K2804, K2CO3+H20+KNO3,C,S

which indicates the possibility of a significantly larger number of reactions.

The addition of sugar or cellulose instead of paraffin (75% KNOs, 10% C, 15% S, 4% sugar)
yields the chemical composition [(KNO3)2C2.3S1(C6H1206)o.1].
[(KNO3)2C2.3S 1(C6H1206)0.1] =>K2S,CO2,N2+K2S04, K2CO3+H20+KNO3,C,S

which yields a similar set of chemical equations, but with slightly different coefficients.

In a similar manner, the composition of the final products can be calculated when part of the
potassium nitrate is replaced with ammonium nitrate (50% KNOs, 10% C, 15% S, 25% NH4NOs). For this
component ratio, the composition can be written as [(KNO3);.3C3S:(NH4NO3)o.3], which corresponds to the
transformation scheme.

[(KNO3)1.3C3S1(NH4NO3)0.8] =>K2S,CO2,N2+K2S04, K2CO3+H20+KNO3,C,S

The formal number of possible reactions in this system is significantly higher (42), but
considering the constraints on product composition and the number of reactants, a smaller subset may be
used for analyzing the reaction mechanism and for practical calculations.

Moreover, analysis of this system of equations indicates that all of them contain residual amounts
of unreacted carbon and sulfur, meaning that even theoretically, complete combustion of the reactants
cannot be achieved with this composition. Therefore, such a formulation is not optimal.

Conclusions

Thus, using a relatively simple reaction system, the capabilities of the vector-based approach for
analyzing chemical interactions have been demonstrated.

It has been shown that even a small number of components can lead to a large number of final and
intermediate products.

Through real computational examples, a relationship has been established between the number of
possible chemical equations and the number of reactants.

A simple yet effective methodology has been provided for calculating all possible chemical
equations within a reaction system for arbitrary component ratios, allowing the enumeration of all feasible
chemical reactions.

A method has also been proposed for calculating the chemical composition for a fixed set of
reactants, enabling the evaluation of the set of products resulting from possible chemical interactions for a
given initial composition.
