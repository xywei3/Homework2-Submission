Abstract

For three-dimensional Kerr-de Sitter space-time, we find the singular energy-momentum and
spin tensor sources that generate the non-trivial geometry. The energy-momentum tensor is
symmetric, conserved and compatible with a spinning massive point particle whose mass and
angular velocity we determine. The calculation is based on the analysis of the holonomy for
a closed loop around the singularity of the SO(1,3) Chern-Simons gauge field appropriate
for gravity in the presence of a positive cosmological constant. This holonomy is related,
via the non-abelian Stokes theorem, to the singular source terms at the center. Our results
may be helpful for a better understanding of the algebra of observables of a local observer

in the Kerr-de Sitter space-time.

1 Introduction

An interesting question about black holes that is seldom asked is “What is the energy-momentum
tensor of the black hole?” or “What is the source term in Einstein’s equation that makes the
geometry non-trivial?” Black hole geometries typically being vacuum solutions, their sources
are located in regions, which usually are excluded from space-time[_] For the Schwarzschild black
hole, for example, this question has been considered only in the mid 1990’s fa), and the solution
understandably requires distributional techniques (2\)3}). Three-dimensional gravity provides a
simpler set-up and yet is of quite a bit of interest as an exactly soluble system in terms of

Chern-Simons gauge theory (445). For the BTZ class of solutions (6), the question about the

sources was recently considered in (7).

Working out the details of the central singularity may also improve one’s understanding of
the algebra of observables of a local observer entangled with the source and shed light on
the construction of microscopic holographic models. In the case of low-dimensional de Sitter
holography, the double-scaled SYK model (DSSYK) seems to be a very good candidate for a
microscopic model describing a heavy object interacting with the de Sitter environment {10} {20}.
In this context, solutions to three-dimensional de Sitter gravity and their thermodynamic
properties have recently seen a revival of interest (31)

Our work is motivated, in particular, by the work of Tietto and Verlinde [31], who developed

a microscopic quantum statistical description of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter static patch and an

observer and matched the thermodynamic properties of this system with the thermodynamics of

'A similar statement applies to charged black holes, for which the electromagnetic field’s energy-momentum

tensor provides some, but not all, gravitational sources.
he DSSYK model. A particular feature of the DSSYK model is the appearance of two distinct
emperatures, which find their counterparts as the horizon temperature and the temperature
an observer at the singularity experiences Despite the matching of the de Sitter and DSSYK

hermodynamics (31), to our mind, a better understanding of the observer would be desirable.

In particular, if one identifies the observer as part of the gravitational source at the center, the

intrinsic properties of the source should play a physical role in this description. Obtaining these

properties is the main goal of this paper. In order to be more general, we will include rotation,
which leads us to consider Kerr-de Sitter space-time in three dimensions.

Thus, the main subject of our study is the Kerr-de Sitter metric

Here, @ and r+ are the de Sitter radius and the radius of the cosmological horizon, respectively,

whereas r_ parameterizes the angular momentum

3] The metric is a vacuum solution of

Einstein’s equation with positive cosmological constant A = @~?. There is only one horizon.

Special cases of (1-1)

space-time in static coordinates, given by rz = @, r_ = 0. In all cases except the de Sitter

are the static Schwarzschild-de Sitter space-times for r_ = 0 and de Sitter

space-time there is a singularity at r = 0.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In order to accommodate a rotating source it
is necessary to include torsion by using the first-order formulation of gravity. We review this
formulation, together with some special and useful features in three dimensions, in section 2] In
section [3] we explain how the Chern-Simons formulation of de Sitter gravity with gauge group
SO(1,3), together with the non-abelian Stokes theorem, can be used to evaluate the relevant
components of the curvature and torsion singular terms. This procedure is put into practice
for the Kerr-de Sitter metric in section |4| where we obtain the energy-momentum and spin
tensor sources that are located at the center. In section |5| from these results we calculate
the conserved charges, namely energy and angular momentum, as they are measured by an
observer co-moving with the source. Finally, we conclude in section [6] Two sections, which are
somewhat unrelated with the main line of our calculation, are included as appendices. These
are a review of the Kerr-de Sitter thermodynamics (appendix |[A) and another way of obtaining

the energy-momentum tensor in the case of the conical singularity of Schwarzschild-de Sitter

space-time (appendix |B).

?For de Sitter black holes in more than three dimensions, the presence of more than one horizon temperature
has been known for a while and is often taken as an indication that such black holes are thermally

unstable.

2 First-order formulation of gravity in three dimensions

In the first order formalism, the gravitational field degrees of freedom are the dreibein, e*,,,

be = lel yn, Which compose the frame and spin connection one-

and the spin connections, w%
forms, e* = e*,,da" and ea ab dat, respectively. The gravitational field is described by the

curvature and torsion tensors,

BP vy = 2 (Qu) +0 oy w)) ; (2.1)

Ty =2 (yey + oye) - (22)

It is understood that the conversion between tensor coordinate indices (greek) and frame indices
(latin) is done by contracting with e*,, or its inverse, e“,, as appropriate, and raising or lowering

of indices with the appropriate metrics, 9, Or jay. The standard coordinate representations of

the curvature and torsion tensors are obtained from (2.1) and (2.2) via the identity

Very = Onety — Mr ywe®, + w mer, =0, (2.3)

where Pha is the affine connection.
We consider the Einstein-Hilbert action in the presence of a cosmological constant and a

matter term,

1 Vv au s fy te gg
S= Te [ere (ete oR are - 2A) +/ dz eLm(b, Vurh,e ‘e) 3 (2.4)

where w stands for matter fields, and the matter Lagrangian density Lm is a scalar. According
to the minimal coupling prescription (39|[40], the spin connections appear in £m only through

the coupling to wv,

Vil = Ou — xu Dap P (2.5)
where Yq» are the generators of the so(1,2) Lorentz algebra in the appropriate representation.

We omit the indices on matter fields.
The field equations that follow from (2.4) are the Einstein equatior{|]

T*, and S*,. are the energy-momentum and spin tensors, respectively. In the presence of
torsion, the Riemann tensor is not automatically index-pair symmetric, Rapeqd # Reda, 80 that
neither the Ricci tensor nor the energy-momentum tensor are necessarily symmetric.

The Bianchi identities, together with the gravitational equations of motion, imply conser-

vation laws for the energy-momentum and spin tensors] The first Bianchi identity,

contracted twice, in general leads to

To simplify this further, one needs to take into account the properties of three-dimensional
space-time.
In three dimensions, the Wey] tensor, which is defined as the traceless part of the Riemann

tensor,

Cty = Raq — 451 (2 a 7 n) (2.13)

vanishes identically. A simple proof of this well-known fact is a warm-up exercise for the reader.

Consider the double Hodge dual of the Wey] tensor,

(xCx)i7 = qeiaoe™ eae : (2.14)

Because of the identity

cancetel = 65465 , (2.15)

there is at least one trace on the right hand side of (2.14), so that («Cx);? = 0 by definition.

Since the Hodge dual is invertable, one has
C8 og = CM (xC*) i €jea = 0 « (2.16)

Therefore, in three dimensions, (2.13) tells us that the Riemann tensor is algebraically deter-

mined by the Ricci tensor.

°These can be found also by the Noether procedure fio).
After using the vanishing of (2.13) in (2.12) to eliminate the Riemann tensor and substituting
the Einstein equation (2.6), one obtains the conservation law

The vanishing of the Weyl tensor also allows to rewrite the Einstein equation as follows.

Consider the two-forms
EY = RY Act Ac’ = pRcae’ Net — Net Ac? . 2.18)

If one eliminates the Riemann tensor and uses Einstein’s equation (2-6), this becomes
EY = —87G (arte! Ne + TA e') 2.19)

Then, performing a left Hodge dual yields

or, in coordinate form,

(*E),, = (KE); ep, = —47GT"y, €vpo da” A da? . 2.21)

Similar manipulations can be done also with the torsion tensor. Consider the double Hodge
dual

Using (2.15), this can be transformed into

in which we recognize the left hand side of the torsion equation (2-7), ie.,

(xT *) av° =81G Sab . 2.24)

In addition, (2.23) tells us that the torsion tensor is equal to its double Hodge dual if and
only if it is traceless. However, this is a reasonable physical assumption, at least in our case,
because it ensures the absence of products of delta function terms in the conservation laws

(2.10) and (2.17). Therefore, we will henceforth assume that
Ta =0, T ab = (AT *) av” (2.25)
Under this assumption, the torsion two-form can be rewritten as

3 From Chern-Simons to the central singularity

Three-dimensional gravity can be formulated in terms of a Chern-Simons gauge theory (4. In
the case of de Sitter gravity (A > 0), this theory is complex with the gauge group SL(2,C)
and its quantization leads to an SL(2,C) WZW conformal field theory with imaginary levels.
An analysis of the asymptotic symmetries has allowed to calculate the entropy of 3d de Sitter
space and asymptotically de Sitter black holes (22][241/43], although the application of the Cardy
formula is somewhat subtle due to the presence of complex charges.

For our purposes, however, we will not need the ”dynamics” of the Chern-Simons formula-
tion, but only its ”kinematics”. Adapting the work of |7| on BTZ space-times to the de Sitter
case, we will work with the gauge group SO(1,3), allowing for a real gauge algebra. Another
reason for using SO(1,3) instead of SL(2,C) is that SL(2,C) is two-to-one homomorphic to
SO(1,3). The same is true for their subgroups SL(2,R) and SO(1, 2), the latter corresponding
to frame rotations. This two-to-one homomorphism leads to overall sign ambiguities in the
SL(2,C) gauge holonomy.

Starting from the standard so(1,3) generators Jap (A, B = 0,1, 2,3),

which satisfy the Lorentz algebra

where E® is the two-form defined in with A= ¢-?,

The field strength F vanishes wherever the vacuum field equations and are satis-
fied. In the case of Kerr-de Sitter space-time, this means everywhere except possibly at r = 0.
It is, then, possible to determine the singular curvature and torsion terms by evaluating the
holonomy of the gauge field A for a (tiny) closed loop around the origin (7. The missing link
is provided by the non-abelian Stokes theorem (43}{45], which relates the Wilson loop of a non-

abelian gauge field to a surface integral involving the field strength. This is similar to, but

°T many contexts one uses F = dA —igA AA. The formal gauge coupling parameter is set to g = i.

For more details of the set-up see [4].

Consider a circular loop of radius r around the origin of a plane parameterized by polar
coordinates (r,@) and recall that a singularity may be located at r = 0. Because of rotational
invariance, one may always find a frame, in which A = ¥"()Auly(@)] is independent of ¢.
Therefore, the path ordering in is irrelevant, and the Wilson loop (3.7) becomes a matrix

exponential
Uae] = exp [-2mAg(r)] - (3.9)

On the other hand, the integral on the right hand side of (8.8) receives a contribution only from

the origin, because the integrand vanishes anywhere else. This implies that reduces to
exp [—27A4(r)] = exp [—U(r)~ fF U(r)] , (3.10)
with
{= / Ps (3.11)

In (3.10), U(r) is the Wilson line along a curve from an arbitrary point along the loop to the
singularity at r = 0. The integral in (3.11) just picks up the weight of the delta-function term
of F (7. Therefore, by evaluating the left hand side of (3.10) we can gain information on the

delta-function singularity of the curvature and torsion tensors, which stem from the source

terms in the gravitational field equations. For this purpose it would be sufficient to evaluate the
holonomy for an infinitesimal loop. Nevertheless, we will consider a loop with a finite radius
and explicitly verify the structure of the right hand side of (3-10).

Considering an infinitesimal loop, does not imply, however, that f = 27A4(0), because

there is no unique inverse of a matrix exponential. To find a unique physical answer for f, one
must remember that de Sitter space is not only free of singularities, but also void of matter
sources. Imposing, then, f = 0 for de Sitter space-time gives the desired solution. More precisely,

writing the 4 x 4 matrix Ag as
Ag(r) = V(r) "AdiagW (7) , (3.12)

where Agiag is the diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues of Ag, which must be independent of r ac-
cording to the structure discussed above, and V(r) is an appropriate non-singular transformation

matrix, it is clear that
exp [-27Ag(r)] = V(r)! exp(—27Agiag) V(r) = V(r) exp(—27Agiag — 20iN)V(r) , (3.18)

for any N = diag(nj,n2,n3,n4), M1,N2,n3,n4 € Z. Because we want to interpret the expo-
nent as an element of so(1,3), there are further conditions such as the reality of V-LiNV and

tracelessness, ny + ng +n3 +n4=0. Anyway, the solution we seek obviously is
N = iAdiag,ds ; (3.14)
which means that we can finally identify

f = 2rV(0)7" (Adiag — Adiagas) V(0) - (3.15)

A transformation matrix V(r) that diagonalizes Ag, see (3.12), can be determined as follows.
First, one solves VAg = AgiagV, which yields a matrix V(r) involving four non-zero, but otherwise
arbitrary complex coefficients, which may also be functions of r, one multiplying each row. Let
us call these coefficients fi(r) (¢ = 0,1,2,3), with f(r) multiplying the i-th row. Clearly, the

matrix inverse V(r)~! then contains a factor of f;(r)~! multiplying the i-th column. Because

ow

these two matrices, for r = 0, sandwich a diagonal matrix in (3.15), the result f is independent
of the fi.

r-dependence of the holonomy Before proceeding to the calculation of f, however, let us
determine the Wilson line U(r) in (3.10), which is an additional check of the non-abelian Stokes
theorem. It is given by

U(r) = V(0)7!V(r) . (4.7)
By the same argument as above, U(r) depends on the four ratios filr) = OE Imposing that
U(r) € SO(1, 3), i-e.,

U(r)nU(r)? = 7 , det U(r) =1, (4.8)

provides two relations for the ratios f;(r). Using these relations, one also finds that det V(r) is
independent of r. Still, a lot of choice remains. We pick the quite symmetric form

Spin tensor We can also extract t

1e components of the spin tensor S%,. from (4.15), (4.16),

using (2.24) and the assumption (2.25). Clearly, (4.15) and (4.16) vanish for r_ = 0, so that

the torsion is identically zero in this

case. This is indeed as one would expect in the absence

of rotation. Henceforth, we consider r_ > 0, because the limits r_ + 0 and r — 0 do not

commute in the inverse frame e/g.

Let us assume that also the spin tensor, like the energy-momentum tensor, has support

only on the trajectory of the central

The Kerr-de Sitter space-time has two independent Killing vectors. Let us calculate the
associated charges as they appear to an observer moving along with the source at the center.
The world-line of such an observer is given by (4.19), but let us rescale 7 = ato such that 7 is

the proper time of the observer. Thus,
nt = y!(r) = a(1,0,w) , (5.3)

The world-line tangent (5.3) is itself a Killing vector, and the associated charge can be

Interestingly, one can observe the following relation,

where m is the mass parameter (4.23). This is quite suggestive, but we have not been able
to find a meaningful thermodynamic law that involves the variables defined in this section,
except in the special case without rotation, r_ = 0. In that case, the observer’s thermodynamic

entropy agrees with the Gibbons-Hawking entropy.

6 Conclusions

In this paper, we have analyzed the singularity of three-dimensional Kerr-de Sitter space-time
and obtained the singular energy-momentum and spin tensors that generate the non-trivial
geometry. This analysis was based on the holonomy of an SO(1,3) Chern-Simons gauge field
appropriate for gravity in de Sitter space in connection with the non-abelian Stokes theorem.
For this purpose, it would have been sufficient to calculate the holonomy for an infinitesimal
oop around the singularity, but we have considered a loop with a finite radius in order to
check the group structure of the holonomy. A failure in this structure would have signaled a
oreak-down of the distributional interpretation of the source terms. The ambiguity related to
he presence of multiple roots of the group (matrix) identity has been fixed by the physical
condition that de Sitter space-time is source-free. Our main results are the explicit expressions
of the symmetric energy-momentum tensor and the spin tensor. Both tensors are conserved,
ecause the torsion is trace-free. The energy-momentum tensor is compatible with a spinning
massive particle whose mass and angular velocity parameters we have determined. Two details

of our results are worth mentioning: First, we have found a physical condition on the parameters

(£25) that, to the best of our knowledge, has not appeared elsewhere. Second, the spin tensor,
which is identically zero in the case without rotation (r_ = 0), does not vanish in the limit
r_—> 0. It would be interesting to interpret the coexistence of these two rotation-free solutions
in terms of a phase transition at J = 0.

In prospect, our results may be helpful for the formulation of thermodynamic relations as

they are seen by the observer, along the lines of (31). As a first step in this direction, we

16
have calculated the conserved charges as they should appear to an observer co-moving with the
source. However, we have not been able to identify any meaningful thermodynamic laws in the
presence of a non-zero angular velocity (r_ > 0), so that further investigations are needed. We
remark that one may introduce an observer with an angular velocity that is a priori different

from that of the source, leading to an additional parameter to play with.

A Kerr-de Sitter Thermodynamics

The thermodynamics of Kerr-de Sitter space-time has already been discussed in (22)[24]/28}30}.
There are, in fact, several versions depending on whether or not one includes the cosmological
constant and/or Newton’s constant as thermodynamic variables (46) {53}. Let us follow and
include both.

For the Kerr-de Sitter metric

and angular velocity:

one easily determines the following horizon temperature

flrs) re tr?
T= =o to, Ad
An Wer, ? (A-1)
Q= in (A.2)

Note that the geometric definition of the temperature via the surface gravity gives rise to a

negative value. The mass and angular momentum are (22\[24[54[5]

mofo nee =, (A.3)
and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is
S= al (A.5)

We have four parameters in total, G, @, r4, and r_, so that we can introduce four pairs of

thermodynamic variables, namely (S,T), (J,Q), (p, V), and (N, 11). In addition to the quantities

‘We adopt the convention of [54] ‘or the mass M, which differs by a sign and an additive constant from

the convention of [24]. Actually, we could multiply @ in the numerator of M by an arbitrary number without
affecting the arguments that follow. The angular momentum J is, of course, just the parameter J of the metric

(1.1) with the proper physical dimensions.

17
listed above, we first define the central charge (a dimensionless number)

N= - (A.6)
and the chemical potential by
pBN=M—-TS—Od . (A.7)
Furthermore, we take as the volume
V=V,e" , (A.8)

where V, is the volume of a unit ball in n dimensions. (Reasonable values for n are 1 or 2.)

Then, if the pressure satisfies the CFT equation of state
M=nPV , (A.9)

one may easily verify that the first law holds,

dM =TdS+QdJ— PdV 4+ pdN . (A.10)

B_ Conical singularity of Schwarzschild-de Sitter space-time

Let us consider Schwarzschild-de Sitter space-time and work out the properties of the matter
source at r = 0. This exercise will show that the source is compatible with a point particle and
determine the value of its mass, reproducing the value given in ai].

For r_ = 0, the metric reduces to

The coordinate domains are t € R, r € (0,00), 6 ~ 6+2m. rz is the cosmological horizon
radius, which must satisfy the physical bound ry < ¢. For r; 4 @, there is a conical singularity

at r = 0, which implies the existence of a point-like source term in Einstein’s equation

In order to determine the energy-momentum tensor J, that creates (B.1), we can work out
the effect of the conical singularity on the left hand side of (B.3). In the vicinity of r = 0, the
metric (B.1) becomes

a, RAD 2

which is a cone in the spacial part. The deficit angle of the cone is given by

y= on (1-F) . (B.5)

For physical solutions, one expects 7 € [0,27), hence the restriction 0 < ry < @.
An easy way to find the curvature singularity at the tip of the cone is to apply the Gauss-
Bonnet theorem,
rom f Pay[gR® +5 - dsk=y=1, (B.6)
where we treat the cone M topologically as a disc. For a finite cone of coordinate radius r,
OM is the circle at r = const., k = = the extrinsic boundary curvature, and y = 1 the Euler

characteristic of M. The result for the Ricci scalar, then, is

from (B.3) one finds that the only non-zero component of Ty is

manifestly invariant under reparameterizations of the world line. Using center-of-mass coordi-

nates, we are free to fix the parameterization such that y = (7,0,0), so that the only non-zero
