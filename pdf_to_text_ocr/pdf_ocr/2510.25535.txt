Measurement technology employing optical interference phenomena such as a fringe pattern or
frequency shift has been evolving for more than a century. The systems are being designed better,
and their components are being built better. But the major components themselves hardly change.
Most modern interferometers rely on the same conventional set of components to separate the elec-
tromagnetic field into multiple beams, such as plate optics and beam-splitters. This naturally limits
the design scope and thus the potential applicability and performance. However, recent investiga-
tions suggest that incorporating novel, higher-dimensional linear-optical splitters in interferometer
design can lead to several improvements. In this work, we review the underlying theory of these
novel optical scatterers and some demonstrated configurations with enhanced resolution. The basic
principles of optical interference and optical phase sensing are discussed in tandem. Emphasis is
placed on both familiar and unfamiliar scatterers, such as the maximally-symmetric Grover multi-
port, whose actions are left unchanged by certain gauge transformations. These higher-dimensional,
gauge-invariant multiports embody a new class of building blocks which can tailor optical interfer-

the four-port Grover coin[14] and the symmetric Y-coupler, which schematically compared to a traditional 50:50 beam
splitter in Fig. 1. All three of these devices are interrelated and possess certain symmetries which will be discussed
later in the text. The higher-dimensional, back-scattering or “directionally unbiased” devices have recently been
shown to offer various enhancements to interferometric sensing systems, such as increased resolution, synchronous
readout of several quantities, and a reduced resource count. These devices and the basic interferometric configurations
they improve will form the main subject of this review. Some of the interferometric configurations to be discussed
further are depicted in Fig. 2. In conjunction with this, we will also present the basic principles of linear optical
scatterers and interferometers, emphasizing a practical mathematical framework for identifying the symmetries these
devices possess.

FIG. 1. Comparison of some common symmetric multiports. The balanced beam-splitter (a) produces two transmitting beams
of equal, 50% intensity for any single input, while the four-port Grover coin (b) produces four outgoing beams of 25% intensity,
with one of those being a back-reflection. The symmetric Y coupler (c) produces two equally intense beams when input to
port 1, with no back-reflection. However, when input to port 2, a 25% back-reflection occurs, while 50% of the energy returns
to port 1 and 25% scattering to port 3. Due to the underlying symmetry, input to port 3 is the same as input to port 2.
Symmetry, in this context, is not just in the sense of having equal probabilities. The full mathematical description of the
symmetries a scattering device can possess is described in Section IC. These higher-dimensional devices generalize traditional
interferometric configurations; some of the examples to be discussed in detail later is shown are Fig. 2.

Beyond the devices capable of dividing and recombining light, which typically entails interfacing different materials,
yet another crucial building block of an optical system is ordinary transparent matter. Bulk transparent matter imparts
a phase to the electromagnetic wave propagating within it. This acquired phase differs from the phase that wave
would normally acquire in empty space. For a transparent region of length d, source wavelength (in vacuum) and
refractive index n, the phase @ acquired is

This simple formula is of fundamental importance in optical phase metrology, since it illustrates precisely what
quantities can alter the phase, and thus ultimately be inferred from a phase sensing instrument. The wavelength
dependence makes it clear different colors naturally acquire different phases while propagating through any medium,
even vacuum. The refractive index n is a dimensionless quantity that indicates the speed of light propagating through
the material, or equivalently, the change in the apparent wavelength. It is entirely responsible for the difference in
phase acquired inside and outside of the material. Inside a material, its value is intrinsic to its composition of matter
and thus varies in a considerable number of ways. These different variations underlie much of optical metrology,
enabling many physical quantities to impart an optical phase shift which can be detected.

in the Michelson and Sagnac configurations are replaced with the higher-dimensional Grover coin, while the two-dimensional
plate optics forming the Fabry-Pérot interferometer are replaced with three-dimensional Y-couplers. In each of the multiport
interferometers in case (b), the increased dimensionality combined with back-scattering behavior creates a new pair of coupled
resonators. All of the pictured systems, along with other multiport interferometers, will be presented in detail in Section III.

In the next section, we present a general mathematical framework to describe how fixed distributions of optical
materials scatter light. This framework abstracts away the underlying physical dynamics, treating the action on an
input field energy distribution as a linear transformation enacted by the scatterer. It allows possessed symmetries of
linear-optical scatterers to be identified in relation to certain field transformations, which merely represent a change in
gauge and therefore do not affect any measurable quantity. Certain symmetric scatterers such as the ones shown in Fig.
1 emerge when their parent space is restricted to sets which remain invariant under such transformations. Thereafter
in Section 3, interferometers are defined as phase-tunable scatterers, formed from graphs. The nodes of these graphs
are scatterers of the static type, and each edge connecting two scatterers is associated with an optical phase parameter.
There we review the operating principles of traditional phase-sensing interferometers. This provides a baseline for
contrasting the modern proposals that employ higher-dimensional multiport building blocks. After discussing these
systems and their advantages, general conclusions are summarized in Section 4.

II. OPTICAL INTERFERENCE & LINEAR-OPTICAL SCATTERERS
A. Background

The phenomenon of interference is fundamentally the result of superimposing, or adding together, different waves
that exist in sp The goal of this section is to provide a mathematical description of this superposition in optical
scattering devices. The optical states will be represented as a vector with complex-valued entries. The complex-
number representation allows both phase and magnitude (total energy) to be encoded in each entry. Meanwhile the

scatterers, which distribute the optical energy according to a linear transformation, will be represented by a matrix,
which acts on these vectors.

Generally, any wave or periodic phenomenon can be expressed or decomposed into a basis of orthogonal modes,
such as the m-indexed functions sin(m2) and cos(mx) which underlie Fourier series expansions. In optics, the fields
comprising the electromagnetic waves produced by a given source can be expanded in a modal basis which depends on
the refractive index distribution considered. In a homogeneous medium, such as vacuum, these are the familiar plane
wave functions of the form Epe*?~“!, where |k| = 27n/A, the optical frequency w is 27c/A, c is the vacuum speed of
light, n is the material refractive index, and A is the vacuum wavelength. Ep is the complex-valued mode amplitude.
The problem of finding the modal functions in general involves solving a complicated boundary value problem which
often must be done numerically. However, it is not completely necessary to provide a useful description of optical
interferometers. The present approach is one of many other prevalent matrix methods employed in optical calculations

(15, 16].

B. Matrix formalism of linear-optical scattering

We will adopt the quantum-optical notation since it generalizes to the two-photon states employed in a later section
and encompasses all possible input states. We use the operator al (w,€) to denote the creation of a photon of fixed
frequency w and polarization vector €¢ in spatial mode j. Hereafter the scope will be confined to a single frequency
and polarization, so the explicit dependence of frequency and polarization of al can be omitted. The spatial mode
index is also implicitly tied to some definite wave-vector k; (plane wave model). This dependence can also be omitted
without loss of generality, as long as the propagation direction is specified with an additional subscript whenever
counter-propagating excitations are present within the same spatial mode.

With this notation, a state corresponding to a single photon propagating within this mode would be denoted
a) = at |0) = |j). These single-photon basis states are orthogonal: (k|j) = 1 for k = j and 0 otherwise. A general
superposition of a photon across d spatial modes is then denoted

d

Ib) = So eld). (2)

The coefficients c; are the photon’s complex-valued probability amplitudes. The real number

jc; is then the

probability of measuring the photon in mode j. The state is assumed normalized, so that en le =1.
By identifying the modal basis vectors |j) with the standard basis vector e,, whose kth element is 1 for k = j and
0 otherwise, the state in the preceding equation can be placed into a state vector

C1
a d &
Vals) — Vee; =). ]- (3)
j=l j=l ‘
ca

This representation makes it clear that the total number of modes d is a measure of dimension. Optical qubit states
employ two modes. States involving coherent superpositions of d modes are sometimes known as qudits.

The classical equivalent of a state in the form of Eq. (2) is found by replacing the creation operator with the classical
field mode function. This rescales all of the amplitudes by the square root of the total power in the beam, converting
the probabilities into optical power or a proportionally related quantity. Hence, the probability distribution |c; 2 vs
j is effectively a normalized distribution of optical energy in the state |q). Besides that rescaling, in terms of the
algebraic formalism, it only shifts what is being tied to the standard basis {e1,...,ea}. This has no impact on the
description of the scattering devices and thus the resulting interference they induce. Any distinction made between
single-photon states and classical coherent states in the context of linear interferometry is largely inconsequential
other than an overall normalization factor. Ref. [17] contains further commentary on this.
A linear scatterer will act on the incident state |y,) according to a d x d matrix transformation U, producing the
state |wWout) = U|Win). This implicitly reverses the direction of all the modes, as depicted by the general scattering
situation in Fig. 3. U is known as the scattering matrix. When a photon located entirely in mode j enters the
corresponding port of U, the state produced, in the form of Eq. (3), is simply column j of U. This implies that the
element Uj; is the probability amplitude for a photon entering port j of the scattering device to emerge at port 7. Thus,
|U;;|? is the probability for a photon entering port j to reflect directly backwards. The corresponding amplitudes for
this back-scattering lie on the diagonal of U.

on

When a photon impinges port j, the requirement of energy or probability conservation entails that (Wout|Qout) =

Way |Ui;|? = 1, which must then hold for all j. Maintaining orthogonality at the output, across different single-
photon inputs, similarly requires that es Uij Uj, = 0 whenever i 4 k. These restrictions, when combined, imply
that U'U = I, where Ut is the Hermitian conjugate or complex-transpose of U, Ut = (U)*. This condition is
equivalent to the columns of U forming an orthonormal basis of C”. In other words, energy-conserving linear-optical
scatterers are represented by unitary matrices. This subset of matrices forms a group, known as the unitary group in
d-dimensions and will be denoted U(d).
For a general input superposition, the scattering matrix U redistributes the inputted energy into a new outgoing
superposition. This redistribution of energy is the harbinger of general interference, allowing energy from separate
beams to be combined into one. The net outcome of this redistribution will be a function of both the scattering
matrix U and the initial state amplitudes, and in particular, the relative phases of those state amplitudes.
This discussion pertains to an arbitrary but fixed frequency and polarization, making U a constant. Nonetheless,
the scattering behavior of photons of different frequencies and/or polarizations will generally vary due to the variation
of a material’s optical response with respect to changes in these quantities. This in turn causes U = U(w,€) to be a
matrix-valued function. In fact, since the material scattering response will generally be affected by any change in the
refractive index distribution of the material comprising the scatterer, U will as well. Optical scattering devices are
often engineered to resist this variation.

FIG. 3. A generic, lossless linear-optical scattering device. This d-port device is mathematically represented by a d x d unitary
scattering matrix U. Port 7 is identified with two spatial modes, one for each direction of propagation. The scatterer converts
an input optical state |win) to the output state |Wour) = U|Win). This scattering action redistributes the optical energy in
the input state. The arrows represent the flow of the associated state amplitudes. For clarity the counter-propagating arrows
at the same port are drawn spatially separated, but in reality, the counter-propagating energy flow is perfectly collinear in
each spatial mode. Scattering devices like U can be viewed as nodes of a general graph. Depictions like the above and more
traditional nodal depictions such as those in Fig. 4 will be used interchangeably. A graph of scattering devices is generally
called an interferometer.

Enforcing symmetries by requiring that U remains invariant under a certain field transformation can impose con-
straints on U [18]. An example is reciprocity, which originates in name from the Lorentz reciprocity theorem. This
result pertains to a transformation that interchanges the sources and fields in an enclosed region. A reciprocal scat-
terer is defined as being invariant to interchange of source and detector. Recalling that Uj; is the probability of
detecting a single photon at port i when it enters port j, we see that reciprocity stipulates that Ui; = Uji, or that U
is a symmetric matrix: U = UT [19].

Non-reciprocal scattering devices are far less common than reciprocal ones. They often are formed by locally
breaking the time-reversal symmetry, such as with a Faraday rotator. A global rotation of the system can also
produce a non-reciprocal phase accumulation, via the Sagnac effect [20]. In these devices, forward-propagating light
will acquire a phase which differs from backward-propagating light in the same mode. Transmission can also be
non-reciprocal. For instance, a circulator provides non-reciprocal routing of light. An ideal three-port circulator can
be prescribed a scattering matrix

A physical device with this scattering matrix would be able to perfectly convert counter-propagating excitations in
one spatial mode into identical excitations that populate separate spatial modes, and vice versa. However, circulators
in practice tend to experience both losses and crosstalk. Circulators are readily defined in higher dimensions, and can
be obtained by chaining together low dimensional ones.

C. Scattering process gauge symmetries

Maxwell’s equations are known to possess a certain property known as gauge invariance. This property allows the
underlying field potentials to be redefined in a certain way without changing the physical situation. The principle
has since been extensively generalized and utilized in other areas of physics. Generally speaking, the transformations

etween different choices of gauge form a symmetry group. In the following subsections, we describe analogous trans-
formations to the optical states and/or scattering devices. These are reminiscent of the gauge transforms employed in
general field theories mainly in the sense that they do not physically alter the underlying process’s description. Any
given gauge can be used freely for the sake of convenience. The particular forms of the transformation are different,
so while they might be referred to more precisely as a scattering center symmetry or generalized gauge transforma-
ion, we will use the generic terminology “gauge transformation” as a shorthand. The first set of scattering gauge
ransformations considered also forms a group of its own, the symmetric group Sa.

For radiation of fixed frequency and polarization expanded into a basis of orthogonal spatial modes, as in Eq. (2),
here are two basic transformations which do not change the physical situation [21]. These each provide a formal
equivalence relation which can be used to relate scattering matrices. Scattering devices within the same equivalence
class will not be measurably distinguishable, but can appear as completely different scattering matrices. The different
scattering matrices can be viewed of as the same underlying physical action but expressed in a different gauge.

First, the physical description of any optical scattering process would be unchanged if the numerical labels used
to identify the field modes were modified, for these labels are completely arbitrary. Formally, the relabeling process
enacts a permutation p on the creation operator indices: al > alas:
given scattering device like that shown with its labels in Fig. 3. This variant of transformation will be discussed in
Section ITC 1.

The second transformation is the application of a phase shift to each field mode. In a general state of the form of
Eq. (2), this will enact the change c; — e’*ic;. Since (e’?c;)*(e"*c;) = |c;|?, this transformation does not affect the
distribution of detection probabilities, which is the physical observable. This transformation can be applied locally
to any given scattering device in a general network. Further discussion of this class of transformations is deferred to
Section ITC 2. After presenting an overview of the two interrelated transformations and their general implications,
the subsequent sections discuss specific consequences and examples for the scattering groups U(2), U(3), and U(4).

This is equivalent to relabeling the ports of a

1. Geometric scattering transformations

A permutation or relabeling of d objects can be defined by a bijective function p which maps the set of original
labels {1,...,d} onto itself. There are generally d! such maps, and each can be represented by a d x d matrix P
which acts on a column vector of labels. Throughout this work we will always denote the permutation function and
its corresponding matrix by an upper and lowercase pair of the same symbol. Each permutation P has a well-defined
inverse given by P?, which “undoes” the permutation enacted by P. A full treatment of permutations can be found
in any standard algebra text, such as Ref. [22].

For a general d-mode optical scattering state, permutation of the mode labels acts in the following way

d d

Ib) = So esli) > 1’) = Do esl) (5)

j=l j=l
The energy distribution encoded by this state is unchanged. It is merely being rewritten in a new basis provided by
P. Conversely, had we simultaneously permuted the c; to c,(;) for a permutation h, which may or may not equal p,
then the spatial energy distribution would have been measurably different before and after the permutation. This is
why only the labels and not the coefficients are permuted.

Element Uj; of a general scattering matrix is the probability amplitude for an incident photon at port 7 to scatter
to port 7. Permuting the mode labels affixed to each port maps Ui; + Upciyp(j). This permutes both the rows and
columns by the same permutation p.

It can be shown that pre-multiplication of U by the associated permutation matrix P will permute the rows of
U. Then, post-multiplying U by P7 will enact the permutation p on the columns of U, which can be deduced by
expressing UP? = (PU7)*”. Combining the two results, we see that the aggregate affect of a mode or port relabeling
on a scattering matrix U is the similarity transformation

U + PUP’. (6)

This is the general form of the geometric gauge transformation; that is, it describes how to transform the matrix U
written in one gauge into a different gauge. Being a conjugation transformation, it allows any given U to be associated
with the equivalence class {PU P? : P is a permutation matrix}. Any members common to the same equivalence class
will not be physically distinguishable, despite the general possibility that the form of their scattering matrices will
differ. In accord with this, the equivalence of two scattering matrices U; and U2 will be notated U; ~ U2.

The gauge freedom provided by this transformation is the ability to label the ports or modes in a way which
produces the form most convenient to work with. In tandem it provides a means to show two apparently different
scatterers are in fact the same. Beyond this, though, it naturally leads to the notion of a symmetric scatterer. These
so-called gauge invariant devices are left unchanged by a specific permutation. This implies U = PUP?. After
post-multiplying by P and rearranging, this is equivalent to

UP — PU :=[U,P] =0. (7)

Scattering matrix families can be defined by this condition with certain P in mind, greatly reducing the number of
free parameters they possess. Specific examples of this will be provided later in this section. In essence, the gauge-
invariance corresponds to certain subsets of ports behaving identically when excited by the same input state. This can
be connected to physical symmetries of the scattering process, such as mirror-reflection symmetry and/or rotational
symmetry. This is because that permutation operations, such as exchanging or cyclically permuting subsets of the mode
labels, are equivalent to reflecting or rotating the physical device while leaving the original labels fixed. An example
illustrating this equivalence notion with a generic three-port device is illustrated in Fig. 4. Like any other scattering
matrix, a gauge-invariant device can only be physically specified up to its equivalence class. Applying different gauges
to a specific gauge-invariant device will not change the fact that it commutes with some permutation matrix, but
the commuting matrix itself can change. It is straightforward to show that for Up which is gauge-invariant with
respect to Po, after expressing Up as U in some new gauge Q, then the corresponding invariant-inducing permutation
is transformed to Py > QP »QT = P. This leads to the concept of equivalent permutation classes, which are the
conjugacy classes {QPQ7 : Q, P are permutation matrices}. Members of the same class generate the same kind of
gauge-invariant scattering device. An intuitive picture of these permutation classes can be built with the equivalence
picture of Fig. 4in mind. First, a gauge-invariant scatterer is viewed as a device that is left unchanged by a geometrical
transformation acting on it while its port labels stay fixed. This geometric transformation is tied to an underlying
permutation P. Then the equivalent permutations of P are merely re-expressions of the original port labels which
are used to label U before and after the geometrical transformation. Clearly, this relabeling has no effect on the
geometrical transformation encoded by P.

The transformation enacted by Eq. (6) possesses several basic algebraic properties, which all reflect the fact that it
cannot change the physical description of the scattering process U represents. The gauge transformation will always
preserve the reciprocity and unitarity of U. Another important example concerns the spectrum of U as a gauge
transformation is made. In that case, the eigenvalues are unchanged while the eigenvectors corresponding to these
eigenvalues are permuted by P.

Permutation invariance can also be applied to optical states. Since the phases of the state amplitudes are immaterial
when the state undergoes detection, these can be discarded. Then, a symmetric scattering state is defined by having
an energy distribution which is left unchanged by some gauge transformation P. This is the type of symmetry usually
associated with balanced scatterers that produce beams of equal intensity when a single beam impinges them. Gauge
invariance of the scattering device alone is generally unrelated to the creation of symmetric states.

FIG. 4. Geometric gauge transformations involve relabeling the field modes identified with the ports of a scattering device
U. The indices j of the mode operators undergo a permutation transformation p(j), which transforms the scattering matrix
U to PUP’, where P is the permutation matrix associated with the permutation function p. Permuting the port labels is
also equivalent to applying geometric transformations to the scattering device while leaving the labels themselves fixed. Any
example is shown here for a generic three-port scattering device, where exchange of two labels equates to reflection about the
line between them. The edge colors at the red and blue ports are used to signify the orientation of this pointlike scatterer U.
General permutations P in higher dimensions will enact reflections and/or rotations in higher-dimensional spaces.

2. External phase shifts

In addition to relabeling the field mode indices, which are directly tied to a scattering device’s port labels, external
phase shifts placed around a scattering device will have no affect on its measured energy distribution when a photon
enters one of its ports. External phases translate the total phase acquired by the photon in each mode j by some con-
stant @;. However, the input excitations have no absolute reference phase, so this translation will not be measurable,
due to a lack of knowledge of the starting point.[23]

The general action of a set of externally placed phase shifts is mapping the input state coefficients c; + je",
which can be encoded as a pre-multiplication by the diagonal matrix D = diag(e’?!,...,e’?¢). This means when
scattering through the device with the external phases, |7in) > DU D|win), or equivalently,

U — DUD. (8)

This induces another equivalence notion between different scattering matrices. Two scattering matrices U; and U2
are equivalent in this sense whenever a suitable selection of external reciprocal phases converts one scattering matrix
into the other. In other words, this gauge freedom allows arbitrary selection of desired reciprocal external phases to
recast U into the different but equivalent form DUD. It is readily verified that changing the gauge in this form will
neither affect unitarity nor reciprocity.

All elements U in the equivalence class {DUD : diag(e’®,...,e"®4),61,...,¢a € R} necessarily have the same
probability matrix, formed by taking the elementwise modulus square of U. In some special cases, probabilities will
be zero, allowing the corresponding phases to be chosen freely. This can enable some more non-trivial equivalences.
On the other hand, the notion of gauge invariance has little use here, since it would require DUD = U. This is
generally only valid when the external phases are brought to zero, so that D =I. This case is omitted, as it was for
P =I in the previous section, since all U are equivalent to a matrix which is gauge-invariant in this sense. For this
reason, the term gauge invariant is only used in the context of nontrival (ie. P 4 I) geometric gauge transformations
throughout this work.

Although this phase gauge freedom can be invoked in conjunction with the geometric gauge freedom, the effects of
these two gauge freedoms are not completely separate. Scattering devices which are gauge invariant in the geometric

sense will lie in the same phase-gauge equivalence classes as devices which are not, since these phases are easily
reselected to break any given geometric symmetry. External phases also will generally change the eigenvectors of the
scattering device they surround. Notwithstanding, considering the two gauge freedoms together allow fairly nontrivial
equivalences to be made. Establishing such an equivalence in turn implies that interferometers formed by substituting
one scatterer for its equivalent counterpart will produce the same interferometer, up to global translations of its
parameter space.

Besides writing the external phase gauge transformation as U + DUD for a diagonal phase matrix D, the map
Uij > Uyjet?it?9i admits another useful form. Let e’@+'¢) = e'fie'?s = vy v; be written as the outer product vol.
When external phases are selected for a scattering matrix U, U is element-wise multiplied by the corresponding matrix
vu! denoted U © vv?.

This form, U > U © wv" for u= e’*i can be more practical than the first one; it provides an algorithm to quickly
determine whether two scatterers are equivalent or not, and if they are, what phases are required to construct the
explicit gauge transformation between them. Let U, and U2 be scattering matrices with the same classical probability
matrix. Express U; = |U| © Qi and U2 = |U| © Qz where |U| is the matrix formed by taking the magnitude of each
element of U; and U2. Next define Q = Q1 © Qs, where Qst is found by taking the scalar inverse of each element
of Qa. The matrices Q1 and Q2 will be entirely phase factors, so this inverse is always well-defined. Since U; and U2
have the same underlying probability matrix, Q = U, © US ~1_ By the above, if Q is expressible as an outer product,
then U; ~ U2, and Q directly prescribes the gauge transformation as Uz © Q = Uj.

For an outer product matrix, each column must be a scalar multiple of the first column. This is easy to check, can
be done in parallel, and can be halted upon any column’s failure to meet the condition. If Q meets the condition,
the outer product factorization vw? = Q is found during the assessment stage, since v will form the first column
of Q while the very factors that scale this column to generate each other column will form w. A global scale factor

1=e%-* can then be used to exchange phase between v and w to symmetrize the outer product into the form vv".

D. Directionally biased and unbiased devices

Now that the background theory for the two scattering gauge freedoms has been established, specific systems can
be considered in detail. When an input scattering state |yin) is directed toward a gauge-transformed U’ = PUP,
the output state is |vou.) = PUP? |W,). This product can be intuitively described in the following steps: first the
input state is first transformed by PT = P~! to undo the permutation, then it experiences the scattering action of
the original U, and then it is placed back into the correct labeling with P.
When these permutations are applied to the indices of the scattering state’s mode operators, it has been implicitly
assumed that the input modes and output modes were the same. This is a direction-free or directionally unbiased
convention. Strictly speaking the incident state basis is different than that of the scattered state leaving the device,
since the modes corresponding to counter-propagating optical excitations in a given spatial mode are distinct. It is
often unambiguous to disregard this distinction, but in instances where counter-propagating excitations populate the
same spatial mode, the direction needs to be specified. For instance al p can represent forward propagation while

a; 3 represents backward propagation. This would effectively double the dimension of all the matrices involved: the

operator basis would go from fal, er al} to fas ag y as aly, oe that where F' represents ingoing and B represents
outgoing.

By definition, the only scattering that occurs is cross-coupling between the ingoing and outgoing modes. This
means any scattering or permutation matrix A expressed in the direction-free basis would become a block matrix

in the direction-specific basis. The conjugate is needed to express the coupling going backwards, or from outgoing
to ingoing, in order to maintain time-reversal symmetry. The dimensionality is not changed in either representation:
the block 2d system has dimensionality d, so for the sake of convenience the compact d x d notation is used.

The sparse notation in the preceding equation can be viewed as a feed-forward or feed-through system, where the
scattering device routes all of the energy in one set of modes through to another disjoint set of modes. An analogous
reduction in dimensionality can occur once again, in the direction-free picture, under the assumption of the following
gauge symmetry. Let d be an even number and U be a d x d scattering device (expressed in the compact notation).
Assume U commutes with the gauge transform operator P where

AB
r(85) (11)
and enforcing PUP? = U leads to the conditions A = D and B = C, so that U can be written
AB
Us (e 4) ‘ (12)

This is the general form of a scattering device endowed with the gauge symmetry P. A block feed-forward scattering
device additionally satisfies the condition A = 0. This produces the matrix

U= (° a (13)

Thus, a block feed-forward matrix scatters all light in the set of modes fal, wees ahyo} into the disjoint set {ah oss beng al},
mimicking the form of Eq. (9). Sometimes these scattering devices are called directionally biased, since they admit
a unidirectional sense of energy flow, which is illustrated in Fig. 5. These block feed-forward devices are a special
case of the general non-reflecting or feed-forward scattering device, which is defined by the condition that its diagonal
values are all zero. The resemblance to Eq. (9) is even closer when the transformation is reciprocal, as this allows U

to be written
_ (0 BT
U= (3 0 ) 3 (14)

Reciprocal block feed-forward devices are ubiquitous. They allow the d x d matrix U to be represented by an even
further compactified transmission matrix B. B inherits the unitarity of U, so block feed-forward scatterers can be
viewed as the embedding of a lower-dimensional unitary group in a higher-dimensional space. This change in the
effective dimensionality is tied to the underlying gauge symmetry, which itself results from the system possessing a
mirror symmetry with respect to the entire sets of input and output modes.
Even if U is reciprocal, the block B itself does not need to satisfy B = B™. This allows block feed-forward devices to
produce effectively non-reciprocal mathematical operations. The aforementioned gauge freedoms also may be applied
to B. In fact, the condition B = BT can be tied to another gauge invariance, corresponding to block mirror symmetry
between the input and output sets of modes.
Block feed-forward scattering devices include the standard beam-splitter, the waveguide coupler, as well as the Reck
and Clements beam-splitter meshes [24, 25]. Multi-mode waveguide interferometers and d x d waveguide couplers
such as a fiber tritter also realize this form [26]. The Hadamard-convention beam-splitter transmission matrix H is

(e ae (16)

The three-port optical circulator introduced in Eq. (4) serves as the physical link between the feed-forward and
unbiased forms of any given scattering device. Placing a circulator at each port of an unbiased device will produce the
equivalent block feed-forward one. To convert a block feed-forward device into an unbiased one, each input/output
pair needs to be connected to a common three-port circulator.

whereas its regular scattering matrix is

E. U(1) scattering processes

A U(1) scattering process is simply a back-reflection that acquires some necessarily reciprocal constant phase e’?.
This phase can always be gauged away using the external phase shift freedom. The only permutation available is the
trivial identity permutation, so no interesting geometric gauge invariants exist in this space. Overall this scattering
space is trivial, containing just the identity equivalence class.

——— Input |y;,)

——— Output |Wout)

FIG. 5. Two equivalent scattering matrix conventions. In convention (a) the ingoing and outgoing modes are associated with
the same port, producing a d x d matrix U. In convention (b) these sets of modes are kept distinct, and assigned to different
ports. This produces the 2d x 2d block matrix form in Eq. (9). The ports are abstract entities, so their identification with a
single mode or pair of counter-propagating modes is immaterial. Nevertheless, certain, so-called block feed-forward scattering
matrices expressed in the unbiased convention mimic the block form, and can be compactified further, as in Eq. (13).

F. U(2) scattering processes

For a generic U(2) scattering device U with external phase shifts ¢; at port j, light entering either port can either
transmit through or reflect back. The general form of this transformation (for 6; = ¢2 = 0) is thus

e181 tet
U= (rs 2€ s): (17)

tre’ ret

The numbers 11,72, ¢1,t2 are the magnitudes which lie in the range [0, 1], while 61, 62,71, and 2 are the corresponding
real-valued phases. Due to unitarity, we have normalization conditions r? + t? = r3 + t3 = 1 as well as orthogonality,
manifesting as

rytye tM + potyet2— = 0, (18)
This can be rewritten as
r(l—- r2)\i/2 +ro(1— 72) V/2¢ei¢ =0, (19)

where ¢ = 6; +62 +71 —72- Both r}(1—r?)!/? and rp(1—r3)!/? are positive real numbers, implying that the variable
¢ must be selected such that e’? = —1, yielding

ri(1 —r2)¥/? = r9(1 — r3)¥/?. (20)

This can only be satisfied for r) = ra (meaning t; = t2) as well. Thus, a two-dimensional unitary scattering device
cannot have non-reciprocal transmission. The phase constraint is that

o=6, +602 -%1 — 72 = 2aM4+7 (21)
12

for any integer m. This constraint is unchanged when external phases are included, but including those allows us to
set d1 = —(¥1 + y2 — 62) /2 and ¢2 = —d2/2, so that $1 + d2 = —(91 +72 — 62)/2 — 62/2 = —(91 +72) /2, resulting in

( = (- ea _ ( = a- mney (29)

(1 — 2) 1/2¢-to2—11)/2 i (1 —r2)'/2e-14 f

where 2A = 72 — 71. This analysis has reduced a generic two dimensional unitary optical scatterer to its minimum
number of measurable parameters, two. r controls the energy division and A determines the degree of non-reciprocity.
If the device is reciprocal, A = 0, and the only measurable parameter is the splitting ratio. In fact, for this two-
dimensional case, enforcing U to be gauge-invariant with respect to swap of labels 1 + 2 in turn implies that U is
a reciprocal matrix. Consequently, in two dimensions reciprocity and the only nontrivial gauge symmetry imply one
another. This is intuitively rooted in the fact that reciprocity asserts invariance under permutation of source and
detector, and the gauge symmetry P, which permutes the only two ports, effectively asserts the same thing.

Returning to Eq. (22) and setting A = 0, we arrive at the reciprocal wo-port splitter with reflection probability

This matrix is realized by a plate optic excited at normal incidence, with r governed by the interface’s refractive
indices through the Fresnel equations. The device generates symmetric states when r is set to 1/\/2 artificially; no
gauge symmetry can induce this naturally. If another external phase gauge transformation is made, different sign
conventions are obtained. For instance, to obtain a geometrically gauge-invariant form of this matrix, add additional
external phases ¢{, = 37/4 and $5 = 57/4, producing

G. Gauge-invariant U(3) scatterers

In the two-dimensional case, there was only one gauge invariant transformation to consider, which was generated
by swapping labels 1 and 2. In three dimensions, there are 3! = 6 permutations comprising two nontrivial classes.
These two classes are shown in Fig. 6. In this section, we present these gauge-invariant classes, highlighting how the
gauge freedoms reduce the number of free variables in the scattering process description.

(a) Reflections — swap permutations

1. Generalized three-port circulators

In addition to the permutations that correspond to exchanging the labels of any given pair of modes, there are now
distinct cyclic permutations: (1,2,3) — (3, 1,2), with the associated permutation matrix

and (1, 2,3) — (2,3, 1), which is similarly associated with P?.
The general result of imposing a gauge symmetry on a scattering device U will set various elements of U equal to
one another, reflecting the fact that input to some ports behaves no differently than the same input to others. For

reducing U into the form

U= (27)

os

Each column of U is a cyclic permutation of its neighbor. Matrices with this general property are known as circulant.
The same form can alternatively be derived by assuming two reflection symmetries: two exchanges is equivalent to
a cyclic permutation in this space. For instance, (1,2,3) — (1,3,2) after one exchange and then after the second,
(1, 3,2) + (3,1, 2) or (1,3,2) > (2,3,1). The net transformation in either case is a cyclic permutation of (1, 2,3).

When a = 0, exactly one of either b or c must also be zero, and then the system (27) reduces to the circulator,
Eq. (4), or a matrix which is equivalent to it. This example illustrates that unlike in the two-dimensional case, a
geometric gauge symmetry does not always induce reciprocal symmetry. Imposing reciprocity on U in addition to its
rotational symmetry would set b = c.

This is the general form of a non-reciprocal Y coupler or Y branch. The C-valued a,b,c,d and h would produce
ten unconstrained degrees of freedom, but unitarity reduces this. Normalization lowers the count to eight, then the
orthogonality conditions lower this count to five. Finally, the symmetry-preserving external phases ¢; and $2 = $3
can remove two more degrees of freedom, making the final count three.

If this gauge symmetry is also assumed with reciprocity, the added condition b = c removes two more degrees of
freedom, leaving just one parameter left. This case was studied in Appendix I of Ref. [27]. The device, which is a
back-reflecting symmetric Y-branch, was found to have the scattering matrix

r Jd-r)/2 /0—7)/2
re (l-r?)/2 -(l+r)/2 (1-r)/2 |, (30)
(l—r?)/2 (l—r)/2 -(14+r)/2

14

where r can freely be chosen in the set (—1,1). The different scattering states produced by this device, for single-
photon input on precisely one of its ports, is shown in Fig. 7. For any value of r, the output state produced when
a single photon enters port 1 will have a symmetric energy distribution under the same symmetry operator, P. And
although the mirror symmetry ensures the behavior for light entering port 2 is the same as when it enters for port 3,
the output state produced when one of these ports is excited is not necessarily symmetric in its energy distribution.
This only occurs when r is brought to zero, so that matrix becomes

0 1/Vv2 1/Vv2
Y=|1/V2 -1/2 1/2 |. (31)
1/Vv2 1/2 -1/2

This matrix, which originated from a nine-parameter unitary space, is uniquely specified by its various symmetries.
This is often the intended scattering matrix when an otherwise unspecified Y branch is discussed. It is conventionally
used as a compact beam-splitter to realize the transformation al > (al + al)/V2. The device is a hybrid in that it
is feed-forward for input to port 1 but back-reflecting for its other inputs. The general behavior of this symmetric
version of the Y coupler is shown in Fig. 1 (c). This hybrid behavior can only occur in dimensions d > 3. The
complete family of reciprocal, hybrid scattering devices in U(3) is also derived in Appendix I of Ref. [27].

FIG. 7. A Y coupler or Y branch is a three-port scattering device with a mirror symmetry, such as P shown above. If the
device is also reciprocal, its scattering matrix can only have a single degree of freedom r, taking on the form in Eq. (30). As
shown in diagram (a), this device always produces a mirror-symmetric distribution of energy when a photon enters port 1. The
transmission coefficient t = V1 — r?/2. However, diagram (b) illustrates that input to port 2 or 3 generally does not produce
another symmetric output state, as r’ = —(1+,r)/2 and t’ = (1—r)/2. However, when r is brought to zero, these amplitudes
become —1/2 and 1/2 respectively, so that their probabilities are equal, and the output state is symmetric. This form of the
Y coupler exhibits added symmetry and is uniquely specified by the scattering matrix (31).

Y-couplers in practice can exhibit losses, violating the assumption of unitarity. This is especially common in
integrated photonic implementations, where the light tends to radiate out of the device rather than back-reflect at
ports 2 and 3. This is not due to inferior design methodology or fabrication quality. Instead, the devices are only
designed for the forward transformation. Optimizing the design for the reverse transformation while imposing the
reflection gauge symmetry on the device structure would produce a Y coupler more similar to that of Eq. 31. It would
also automatically produce the forward transformation via reciprocity. For some applications, the back-reflections are
viewed as an unwanted nuisance, so employing only the forward transform is useful in those cases. Nevertheless, to
obtain an ideal Y-coupler, a simple decomposition with a beam-splitter can be used. This is shown in Fig. 8, and can
be employed in any platform, e.g., free-space optics, fiber optics, and integrated photonic waveguides.

H. Gauge-invariant U(4) scatterers
1. Beam splitters

The general definition of an ideal beam-splitter is a U(4) scattering device which possesses the block feed-forward
gauge symmetry described above. In this case the relevant block feed-forward permutation invariance is with respect
to the swap of the ordered pairs (1,2) > (3,4). This is associated with a diagonal reflection symmetry in traditional
schematics of beam-splitters, as shown as the red dashed line in Fig. 9. The assumed symmetry produces the beam
splitter scattering matrix

reducing the device to an embedding a U(2) scattering device in a four-dimensional space. Therefore, in essence,
everything pertaining to the four-port optical beam-splitter is described in Sec. ITF on two-dimensional scattering
devices.

The matrix B in Eq. (32) is not necessarily reciprocal. However, in this system, reciprocity is tied to a second
reflection symmetry, over the anti-diagonal line in Fig. 9. The underlying permutation matrix is

p= ( a) (33)

where o represents the swap operator for two modes. Once the block feed-forward symmetry is assumed, this symmetry
P is both a necessary and sufficient condition for reciprocity. If B is reciprocal, adding external phases allows it to
be put into the form

Loopless graphs comprised solely of beam-splitters will generally produce a higher-dimensional scattering devices
which also possess block feed-forward gauge symmetry. These decompositions, which represent a higher dimensional
scattering device as a graph of lower dimensional ones, can be made to span the full unitary group. Two well-known
decompositions with the underlying reflection symmetry of all input and output modes are due to Reck and Clements
et al. (24, 25, 28, 29]. These both require O(d?) beam-splitters and controllable phase shifts to span U(d). These
meshes are versatile, but in practice, they suffer from error accumulation and nontrivial reprogramming procedures.
This has limited their size d to about a few dozen modes today [30, 31]. A non-reciprocal phase placed inside one of
these meshes would break the input/output mirror symmetry, leading to an overall non-reciprocal U. In terms of Eq.
(11), this scattering matrix would have A= D =0 but BC.

2. Grover four-ports

Although a reciprocal, balanced beam-splitter commutes with the block feed-forward gauge symmetry operator,
there are a number of other potential gauge symmetries that it lacks. However, the Grover four-port,

-1111

is unchanged by all possible permutations of its labels, and thus commutes with any gauge symmetry operator. Beyond
that, it produces a fully-uniform, symmetric energy distribution when any one of its ports is excited. It is precisely
the uniform energy distribution which is invariant to any permutation of mode labels.

The matrix originally appeared as a quantum logic gate in the Grover search algorithm [32]. It has since been
employed as a general scattering coin for quantum walks [33] and now more recently as an optical scattering device.

FIG. 10. Forming a generalized four-port Grover coin using two symmetric Y couplers. The standard Grover coin is obtained
when ¢=0.

A photon entering an open or unconnected port of a general interferometer can be viewed as conducting a random
walk on its graph. This variant of random walk is known as a quantum walk, since the paths it traverses are able
to coherently interfere; this distinction is embodied in the use of a unitary time-evolution operator instead of the
traditional probability matrix used in studies of Markov chains. The study of quantum walks in general forms a
subdomain of general quantum information processing. It has been shown that universal computation and efficient
search on a graph can be achieved with quantum walks [36-40]. For an introduction to the field, consult Ref. [33].

For each set of input phases and constituent scattering devices, the action of any interferometer can be computed
by finding the steady-state distribution of the walk, which is the outputted scattering state in the limit of long time.
This can be found numerically using a finite-element assembly approach. This involves using the graph interconnect
information to construct a global time-evolution operator for the walk, enforcing boundary conditions pertaining to

overall network topology, such as an invariance to rotations of the whole graph by a fixed angle. Then, assign the
same scattering matrix to each relevant node, providing them the same vertex label or color.

FIG. 11. Two common interferometric configurations, due to Michelson (a) and Mach and Zehnder (b). Like static scattering
devices, the open ports of interferometric graphs can also be freely relabeled, naturally extending the notion of geometric gauge
symmetry to scattering graphs. Assuming the underlying 50:50 beam-splitters and phase shifters are reciprocal, the devices
will possess the reflection symmetry indicated by the red dashed line. This symmetry implies that input to any port on one side
of the line will behave the same as input to its mirrored counterpart, so long as ¢; and ¢2 are exchanged. The Mach-Zehnder
interferometer can be viewed as constructed by mirroring the Michelson interferometer over the blue dashed line. This line
corresponds to the device’s block feed-forward symmetry. Since these devices inherit the symmetries and overall dimensionality
of their lower dimensional counterparts (c.f. Fig. 9), they are often viewed as tunable versions of them. That is, a Michelson
interferometer can be viewed as a phase tunable plate splitter while the Mach-Zehnder interferometer can be viewed as a tunable
beam splitter. These active building blocks can replace their passive equivalent in any larger interferometric graph. The phase
gauge freedom also allows the placement of external phases at ports 1 and 2 and translation of the values of ¢1 and ¢2 by
arbitrary fixed constants. These can be used to put the overall scattering matrix for each device in the form shown beneath its
schematic. Here the correspondence between nodes and local scattering matrices is clear, since the associated optical schematic
is shown with it. In general, the nodes of a scattering graph need to be clearly associated to a specific scattering matrix, e.g.

through a vertex label or color.

of reciprocal U(2) and U(4) scattering devices. They inherit the symmetries from the reciprocal beam splitters

which form them. In the case of the Michelson (11(a)), the exchange of labels 1 + 2 0
phase parameters leaves the scattering response unchanged. Thus, the computed outpw
excitation at port 1 can be converted to the output corresponding to input at port 2 simp

The general output calculation entails starting with an initial state which is a single photon im

pinging a given port,

such as |Win) = a\|0). Then the scattering matrices are used to sequentially propagate the state though the graph
until every state component has reached the output. This is equivalent to finding all the possible paths the photon can

travel from an input 7 to each output port i. Each individual path is first weighed by the

produc

of all the scattering

amplitudes it encounters going from port j to 7. The final scattering matrix element is found from the sum of these
weighted paths, corresponding to coherent interference of all the paths. The general problem of path counting can

20

grow unwieldy, especially as resonant structures are introduced to the graph, causing the number of possible paths to
grow indefinitely. Some cases can be explicitly summed, but other times an automated path-counting and summing
algorithm is needed, which is what Ref. [41] accomplishes.

For both of the devices in Fig. 11, there are always only two possible paths, one for each arm j containing the phase
@;. Their only difference in output is a meaningless global phase shift of 7, originating from the common convention
of adding a 7 phase shift to the state when it reflects at a mirror. Whether that phase can be observed physically or
not, it can be lumped into the definition of ¢; and ¢2. This causes the device outputs to be identical. We will consider
a photon inputted to port 1 of either device, and assume without loss of generality that the beam splitters take on
the Hadamard convention of Eqs. (15-16). Then, there is an initial splitting into two state components, one in each
arm. These each acquire a phase ¢; and then are reintroduced to a beam-splitter in some way, splitting a second
time. The possible paths from port 1 to port 1 (3) are double-reflection with phase ¢; and double-transmission
with phase ¢2. The corresponding path-amplitudes are (1/V2)(e!®)(1/V2) = e'®/2 and similarly e’?2/2. The
aggregate reflection amplitude for the device is then r(d1, 62) = (e’#! +e’®) /2 The transmission amplitude is similarly
t(d1,¢2) = (e'*! — e'®?)/2, where the minus sign is incurred from the back-side beam-splitter reflection when using
the Hadamard beam-splitter convention.

Thus the aggregate scattering matrix for any lossless Michelson interferometer is equivalent to

while that for a Mach-Zehnder is equivalent to, in block form,

t(d1, 62) = — = eit /2+162/2j sin( gy [2 — 62/2). (38b)

from these forms it is easy to see that the scattering probability for reflection is R = |r|? = cos?((¢1 — $2)/2) while
for transmission is T = |t|? = sin?((¢1 — ¢2)/2). This sinusoidal modulation, which is only sensitive to the optical
phase difference (¢1 — 2), is characteristic of the two-beam superposition accomplished by devices such as these. A
plot of either scattering probability P versus either phase ¢ is known as an interferogram. ¢ itself could be viewed
as a phase difference Ag = ¢ — ¢, for an indeterminable global phase ¢,. The typical sinusoidal interferogram for
two-beam interference is shown in Fig. 12. The system can act as a basic phase sensor: for small changes in the input
phase about some bias point $9, the output change in probability AP is given by the product of the input phase
change and the slope at the bias point. A bias point with a larger slope will then have heightened sensitivity.

B. Traditional interferometric sensing systems

Three two-port interferometers are shown in Fig. 13. In case (a) is the Michelson configuration, which was
discussed in the previous section, is the most simple phase sensor of reciprocal phase shifts. Even if ¢1 or ¢2 were
non-reciprocal, meaning the phase acquired depended on the propagation direction, this could not be observed in
a Michelson interferometer. This is because the double-pass through each arm gives the summed phase for each
direction as a single phase shift: 6; = @jr + djB.

The configuration of Fig. 13(b) is the Sagnac interferometer, which is the simplest configuration for non-reciprocal
phase inference. By converting the two spatially-separated arms of a Michelson interferometer into a loop, any non-
reciprocal difference in phase acquired going clockwise around the common-path loop versus counterclockwise will be
evident. Let the total clockwise phase be $+ and the total counterclockwise phase be ¢— 6. Since this configuration
is essentially the same two-beam interference present in a Michelson or Mach-Zehnder interferometer, those results
can be applied here, but with these phases. The corresponding transmission probability is then

T = |t)? =sin?($1/2 — $2/2) =sin?((¢ + 6)/2 — (d — 6)/2) = sin? (6). (39)

Thus, the transmission probability is zero for a fully reciprocal phase (5 = 0) and increases as the non-reciprocal
component 6 increases. However, the effect can be challenging to observe, due to the intrinsic weakness of non-
s, combined with this weak (52) response for small 6. Nevertheless, it allows the non-reciprocal

This basic interferometric configuration can be used as a phase readout. First the system is placed at a bias point ¢o, verified
by measuring the corresponding probability P(¢o). Then, a small change in phase A¢ induces a change in probability AP

portion of a phase shift to be naturally isolated from the reciprocal one and extracted from a direct measurement.
The configuration is named for Georges Sagnac, who established the existence of a physical effect by which rotation
of a looped optical path induces a non-reciprocal phase shift [20]. The non-reciprocal phase shift 6 is proportional
to the product of the loop area and angular velocity and inversely proportional to the optical wavelength. It is the
fundamental operating principle of optical gyroscopes, and was famously used in 1925 by Michelson and Gale to
measure the rotation rate of the earth [43]. The last century has seen a number of applications and generalizations
to the Sagnac effect proposed [44-47].

The third device, in Fig. 13(c) is the parallel-plate Fabry-Pérot interferometer.[48] The multi-pass structure allows
¢ to accumulate many times, sharpening the phase response around certain values of @. This translates directly to a
sharpened frequency or narrowband wavelength dependence about certain wavelength centers.

The normally-incident transmission amplitude of the Fabry-Pérot interferometer is readily calculated by summing
the different paths from input to output. For an input to port 1, each path is indexed by the number of bounces it
takes before exiting at port 2. The principle beam transmits directly through both plates, acquiring an amplitude
tye'?t), where t; is the transmission coefficient of plate j and ¢ is the phase acquired between the plates. The plates

are assumed to be reciprocal U(2) scattering devices. This allows the reflections coefficients to be written rj = i/Rj
where R; is the plate reflection probability. Then, t; = \/1 — Rj.

The nth beam transmits through the first plate up to the second plate, acquiring tje’®, then makes n bounces
between the two plates, acquiring (rir2e7’*)”, and finally passes through the last plate with amplitude t2. The net
amplitude for the path conducting n bounces before transmitting is thus t)tge!*(ryr2)"e(". Summing these paths
produces the Fabry-Pérot transmission amplitude, t, given by

oo oo
t=ttoe® (1 + Diriree)") = tytoe® (: + So(riree’?*)” - 1). (40)

n=1 n=0

Evidently, this amplitude and the associated transmission probability |t\? can be decomposed into a product of the
output which would have resulted without path interference, |t;|?|to|?, and an interference factor in parentheses. Its
sum can be evaluated as a geometric series, which converges whenever the product of plate reflections |rjr2| = |r1||r2|
is less than 1. This fails to occur only if either plate is fully reflecting, in which case no light will transmit. Otherwise,

non-reciprocal ones. The Fabry-Pérot interferometer (c) is a simple resonant cavity typically employed as a narrow-band filter
of light.

Using the fact that rj = i,/Rj and T; = |t;|? = 1— Rj, the transmission probability T = |t|? can be written

(1— Ri)(1— Ro)
1+ Ri R2 — 2/R1 Ro cos(2¢)

Now if the optical plates are symmetric, so that R; = Ro = R, T can be simplified using the fact that cos2¢ =
1—2sin? d. Substituting this into the denominator yields

T(¢) (42)

1+ R? — 2Rcos(2¢) = 1+ R? — 2R(1 — 2sin?(¢)) = (1 — R)? + 4Rsin?(¢), (43)

where the coefficient of finesse is

F= a me (45)

The transmission probability T is a composition of f(¢) = VF sin @¢ with the Lorentzian function L(«) = 1/(1+ 2).
Several examples of this transmission probability are shown in Fig. 14 (a). The finesse parameter is strictly increasing
with R in the range (0,1), and ultimately determines the sharpness of the resonance. The larger the reflection R, the
more round-trips can occur, on average, before the photon transmits out of the plates. This in turn corresponds to
higher phase sensitivity.

Using the fact that ¢ = 2rnd/A, allows the Fabry-Pérot interferometer wavelength response to be investigated.
Plots of T vs. \ are shown in Fig. 14 (b) for the case d = 10~* meters. The mirror reflection R is assumed to
be constant with respect to wavelength. The narrowband response around certain wavelengths makes this device an
23

excellent tool for filtering out a specific wavelength or frequency. Perhaps the most intriguing physical aspect about
this configuration is that the act of aligning two highly reflective plates perpendicular to one another enables certain
colors to pass through with perfect transmission. This is a result of the interference altering the effective transmission

and reflection coefficients of the combined system.

C. Novel higher-dimensional interferometric sensors

The conventional two-port interferometric configurations shown in Fig. 13 employ low-dimensional linear scatterers,
namely beam-splitters and plate splitters, in simple graphical configurations. The Sagnac and Michelson devices
superimposed two beams, producing a sinusoidal interference pattern. This interferogram was ultimately only sensitive
to one parameter in either case, despite the general presence of two. In the Michelson this was the phase difference ¢q =
1 — ¢2 and for the Sagnac this was the non-reciprocal portion of the loop 6, which is also a relative phase. Meanwhile
the Fabry-Pérot configuration, sums an infinite number of paths in a geometric series, resulting in resonances whose
width was a function of the plate reflectivities, which are generally fixed.

to have a specified orientation, but the Y coupler’s feed-forward port must be specified. Here we assume that port is the
external, unconnected one for each side. In all three of these systems, a pair of coupled optical resonators is formed from the
back-reflecting response of the constituent scattering devices. This increase in dimensionality provides access to new degrees
of freedom in the system output.

The Grover-Michelson was originally considered in Ref. [34]. In that work, the output amplitudes were found by

Thus, replacing the beam splitter with a Grover coin can be viewed as a phase transformation of the linear response (d1—
¢2) to a synthetic nonlinear one ygui1(¢1, $2). This is essentially a reparametrization of the general interferometric
graph’s phase response.

Example plots of the Grover-Michelson transmission probability are shown in Fig. 16. The probability is plotted
with respect to $1 for different fixed values of ¢2. The red curve is the traditional Michelson response, for ¢2 = 0.
Changing ¢2 merely translates this curve. However, in the Grover-Michelson interferometer, sweeping ¢2 continuously
deforms the curves. Being the normal sinusoid but composed with the synthetic phase, the deformation does not affect
the visibility, given by V = (maxg, T — ming, T)/(maxg, T + ming, T), which remains fixed at the value of 1 for any
¢2. The position of the transmission peak in ¢ is given by 27 — #2. As this peak moves towards the value 0 mod 2r,

he peak narrows, leading to a heightened phase response in this region. The slope 0T/0¢, grows much larger than
he traditional Michelson, suggesting a much higher phase sensitivity at the appropriate bias point.

The decompositions of the Grover coin into two Y couplers (Fig. 10) and the Y coupler into a beam splitter and
mirror (Fig. 8) enable experimental implementation of the Grover coin with a relatively small number of common
abletop optics. As a proof-of-principle, a Grover coin was experimentally assembled like this in bulk and used to form
a Grover-Michelson interferometer [13]. The arm phases ¢; and ¢2 were controlled by modifying their corresponding
optical path lengths, which was accomplished by a piezoelectrically actuated translation stage. The source was a quasi-
monochromatic, continuous-wave diode laser with an operating wavelength of 633 nm and coherence length exceeding
a kilometer. The input power was in the microwatt range; there was no need to reduce the power to the single-photon
level since the output obtained is directly proportional to the output probability in that case. Nevertheless, the
genuine single-photon implementation would have presented some differences. As the output power is reduced and
approaches the single photon level, rather than observing a never-ending continous decrease in registered power as
he classical wave picture predicts, the quantized nature of the individual photon energies will eventually manifest as
a discrete sequence of clicks, corresponding to the detection of single photons. More experimental details of the setup
can be found in Ref. [13].

The assembled Grover-Michelson system exhibited curve tunability with high visibility. One example of this,
measured from the reflection signal, is overlaid with the measured response of a reference Michelson interferometer.
This comparison is shown in Fig. 17. The phase response for the same input phase was notably improved, as loosely
depicted by the blue lines. In that case, where Ad; ~ 145 mrad, the corresponding intensity modulation is about 14
times larger for the Grover-Michelson interferometer than its traditional counterpart. This might further improved
by reducing losses. Other modifications to the system could also be considered, as in Ref. [49]

is obtained. Plots of the associated transmission are shown in Fig. 18. When 6 = 0, yas1 = ¢. Thus the reflection and
transmission probabilities depend on the reciprocal part of the loop phase, ¢, and can take on any output value. This
is not the case in a traditional Sagnac interferometer, where the lack of non-reciprocal phase forces the transmission
to be zero regardless of the reciprocal loop phase. Moreover, the resonance, or pole in the phase response, occurs
around the point 6 =0. This means small values of 5 create a sharp dip in the transmission of full-width 26. Scanning
¢ around the origin provides a direct readout for this in the interferogram. This signature is linear in 6 for any 6,
whereas the traditional Sagnac interferometer’s transmission is given by 4? for small 6, placing constraints on the
detector resolution. The full-modulation dip is easy to detect, but requires inducing a change in phase ¢ which is
significantly lesser than 6 in order to resolve 5 with high precision.

3. Higher-dimensional Fabry-Pérot interferometer

The output of the Y-coupler Fabry-Pérot device pictured in Fig. 15 also can be expressed in terms of that of a
regular Michelson interferometer [27]. The output is given by

The traditional Fabry-Pérot only has one phase parameter, which for symmetric plates, traced a Lorentzian-like
function whose sharpness was determined by the finesse F’. F' is a function of the plate reflectivity, which is typically
a quantity fixed by material properties. In the higher-dimensional Y-coupler version, there are now two phases. The
additional degree of freedom allows tuning of the effective out-coupling between the cavity and the output ports. Thus
the effective finesse is tunable through interference. This allows the widths and heights of certain spectral regions to
be controlled with considerable flexibility. A basic example is shown in Fig. 19. The arms are each assumed to be
1.55-10~4 meters with a refractive index of 1. By perturbing the index of one relative to the other, a phase difference
is created between the two arms. Increasing this index perturbation completely reconfigures the filter characteristics,
allowing transmission bands to be converted to reflection bands. Overall, the device acts as a tunable dichroic.

D. Hong-Ou-Mandel two-photon interference

Up to this point, all of the input states have been single-photon states, which only exhibit classical interference.
In this section we consider two-photon states entering separate ports of an optical scattering device, which are of the
form |Yin) = ala4|0). The resulting two-photon interference can be measured with multiple detectors placed at the
28

output ports which count the photons that arrive simultaneously. Perfect destructive interference of the underlying
coincident amplitude leads to a famous Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) dip in the rate of coincidences [51, 52]. The situation
is shown in Fig. 20 (a). Two identical photons impinge separate ports of a generic unitary beam splitter of the form
in Eq. (32). Each individual photon sees its normal scattering action, resulting in the transformation

The coincident amplitude, which leads to the ahah term, is then rjr2+tit2. From the structure of the beam splitter, we

recall the amplitudes r1,r2,¢t, and t2 originate from a two-dimensional unitary transformation, which can be written
in the form of Eq. (17), in which the coefficients are rewritten as separated magnitudes and phases. A consequence

summed phases of the r; and the summed phases of the t; had to be 7. This is precisely the relative phase between
the two terms comprising the coincident term. After dropping the irrelevant global phase, then, this coincident term
can be rewritten as |r1||r2| — |t1||¢2|. Accordingly, if and only if the unitary beam splitter has a 50:50 splitting ratio,
the coincident term vanishes. This is the origin of the HOM effect, producing an output state (a3 + ai!)|0). The
produced state is of two clustered photon amplitudes. The clusters each populate a single mode. There is an equal
probability of measuring a cluster in either of the two modes.

A higher-dimensional generalization to this occurs when two photons impinge two ports of a Grover coin [53]. This
situation is depicted in Fig. 20 (b). The state produced is

The parameters ¢o, 61 and 2 are general phase shifts. If the system were rotated, these phases could be shifted in
conjunction with the Sagnac effect. Placing the arms in different planes allow rotations about different axes to affect
the different phase shift parameters. By adding a circulator to the loops as shown in Fig. 21 (b), a third loop can be
obtained, which allows all three phases to be tied to a rotation direction. With the circulator added, the path from
Gj to G2 exiting a or b; comprises a half-loop about the z axis, the path leaving bz comprises a half-loop about the
x axis, and each path leaving az comprises both a full loop about y and a half loop about x. This allows the phase
shifts ¢o, 1, and ¢2 above to be expressed in terms of the phase shifts induced by rotations about the x,y and z axes
like so:

0 = (bx — G2)/2, (61a)
01 = oz; (61b)
62 = br + by. (61c)

Given measurement of ¢9,¢, and ¢2, the above equations are readily inverted to obtain the rotation phases,

bx = 260 + o1 (62a)
dy = —240 — (¢1 + 42) (62b)
bz = ¢1. (62c)

Thus the system offers the simultaneous determination of three rotations about different axes.

IV. DISCUSSION

In this review, we have discussed the design principles of novel gauge-invariant optical devices capable of providing
a substantial boost in resolution of interferometric sensors. A general approach for identifying physically-equivalent
scatterers has been presented, which provides a basis to recognize or enforce certain symmetries in a scattering
transformation. An emphasis was placed on the gauge-invariant, higher-dimensional Y-coupler and Grover coins,
due to their role in interferometry. The general matrix theory for optical scattering has several other extensions and

A non-reciprocal phase is a relative entity, shared between the counter-propagating directions of the same spatial mode.
Therefore an external non-reciprocal phase is be able to have a measurable effect on scattering systems in general. For
example, consider a standard Mach-Zehnder interferometer, where a tunable phase shift ¢ in one arm is used to produce an
interferogram. An external phase shift placed in that arm will naturally add with ¢. If it is reciprocal, this just translates
¢ and the interferogram it produces, which has no absolute starting point anyways. But, an external non-reciprocal phase
will generate measurable non-reciprocal transmission in a device comprised of entirely reciprocal scattering devices.
