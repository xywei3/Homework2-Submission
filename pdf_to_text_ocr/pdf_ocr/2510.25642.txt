Cc 1. Introduction.

The observed diversity of galaxy morphology could be linked
UW) to their different formation paths. In the local Universe, galax-
CN ies are traditionally classified using the Hubble sequence, which
oO arranges them along a morphology, from spheroidal to disk-
dominated types (Hubble 1926) . The central region of disk
galaxies, so-called the bulge, has distinct kinematics and chemi-
C\\ cal abundances. Early studies classified the bulge as analogous to
<° an elliptical galaxy (Eggen et al. 1962; Noguchi 1999). However,
=, this view has been challenged by more recent studies, which
show that bulges are more complex stellar structures and often
« exhibit significant rotational support. Bulges are commonly clas-
© sified in two broad categories: classical bulges, which present
a dispersion-dominated stellar populations, and pseudo-bulges,
which correspond to a composite of a classical bulge, a disk-like
component, and sometimes a bar (e.g., Fisher & Drory 2010;
Kormendy 2016; Breda et al. 2020). The Milky Way is a clear
example of a galaxy with a complex bulge where the three men-
tioned components coexist (Zoccali et al. 2017; Rojas-Arriagada

et al. 2019; Queiroz et al. 2021)

The formation of the dispersion-dominated component of
bulges has been attributed to fast and violent processes, such
as the gravitational collapse of a proto-galaxy (Avila-Reese &
Firmani 1999), or major mergers that triggered strong starbursts

ABSTRACT

Context. Bulges, located at the central regions of galaxies, are complex structures, expected to be shaped by the physical processes
involved in the assembly history of their host galaxy, such as gravitational collapse, mergers, interactions, and bars. As a consequence
a variety of bulges with distinct morphology and chemistry could be produced.

Aim. We aim at exploring the existence of a stellar mass-metallicity relation, MZ.R, of bulges, and analyze the possible imprint of
characteristics features by accretion and migration of stars, which could store information on their assembly histories.

Methods. We use 44 central galaxies from the CIELO cosmological simulations. Their stellar masses are within the range of ~
[107°, 10!°°] Mo. We decomposed the galaxy into bulge and disk using the circularity and binding energies. We track the stellar
populations in bulges back in time to their birth location, classifying them as bulge-born in-situ, and disk-born stars and accreted.
Results. We find that most of the stars in our bulges are formed in-situ, but 33% of our bulges show a non-negligible contribution
of stellar accretion from satellites, which could add to about 35% of the population. The accreted material is generally contribute by
two or three satellites at most. In some bulges, we also find up to a 32% of stars that migrated from the disk due to secular evolution,
with a median of 10%. Regardless of the formation histories, we found a clear MZ,R for bulges, which is more enriched by about
0.4 dex than the corresponding relation of the disk components, and about 0.15 dex more enriched than the galaxy MZ,R. We find
evidence that the dispersion in the bulge MZ,R is influenced by both stellar accretion from satellites and migration from the disk, such
that, at a fixed bulge mass, bulges with higher fraction of accreted and migrated stars tend to be less metal-rich. Therefore we find a
MZ,R for bulges, which is consistent with an increase of metallicity with increasing mass, while its dispersion stores information on

(Hopkins et al. 2008; Méndez-Abreu et al. 2014). Their origin
appears to be distinct: numerical simulations report the forma-
tion of pseudo-bulges with varying degrees of rotation (Guedes
et al. 2011; Gargiulo et al. 2019), while secular processes have
been found to play a positive role in their build-up (e.g., Kor-
mendy & Kennicutt 2004; Eliche-Moral et al. 2011; Rosito et al.
2019; Gargiulo et al. 2022). Together, these results suggest that
bulge formation proceeds through multiple evolutionary path-
ways, ranging from rapid and violent events to slower, secular
processes shaping the central regions of galaxies. Additionally,
the formation of clumps in early gas-rich disks, which later mi-
grate and fall into the central regions of galaxies, has been re-
ported as another channel for bulge growth (Bournaud 2011;
Perez et al. 2013; Debattista et al. 2023). Since different mech-
anisms may operate in bulge formation, with potentially distinct
efficiencies as a function of redshift (Debattista et al. 2023), their
chemical signatures could provide a valuable diagnostic to dis-
entangle the relative contributions of these processes.

The chemical evolution of galaxies is closely linked to the
physical processes that drive galaxy assembly (e.g., Tinsley
1980; Pagel 1997; Chiappini et al. 1997; Maiolino & Man-
nucci 2019). One of the most fundamental relations in this con-
text is the mass—metallicity relation (MZR), which connects the
galaxy stellar mass to the metallicity of its star-forming gas
(Lequeux et al. 1979; Skillman et al. 1989; Zaritsky et al. 1994;
Tremonti et al. 2004). This correlation has been well established

for decades, both in the local universe (e.g., Tremonti et al. 2004;
Zahid et al. 2014) and at high redshift (e.g., Lewis et al. 2024;
Cheng et al. 2024). The prevalence of this relation has been stud-
ied up to redshift z ~ 7, and beyond with the contribution of the
James Webb Space Telescope (Stanton et al. 2024). It is com-
monly interpreted as reflecting the ability of higher-mass galax-
ies to retain metals more efficiently, thereby reaching higher
metallicities. Numerical simulations are able to reproduce the
MZR at least in the low redshift universe (e.g. De Rossi et al.
2017; Zenocratti et al. 2022). Analogously to the gas, the stel-
lar mass-metallicity relation is likewise in place (Gallazzi et al.
2005; Kirby et al. 2013). This relation has a similar shape to the
MZR, but it reflects the cumulative evolutionary history of the
interstellar medium (ISM), since stars inherit the chemical abun-
dances of the gas from which they form. The stellar metallicity
trace the integrated history of the stellar populations in a galaxy.
Traditionally, stellar metallicity has been derived by fitting spec-
tral energy distributions of composite stellar populations to the
integrated spectra of galaxies (Conroy 2013). However, in recent
years, with the use of integral field units (IFUs), it has become
possible to determine the two-dimensional distribution of stellar
population properties, giving rise to the so-called resolved rela-
tions MZR (Gonzalez Delgado et al. 2014; Camps-Farifia et al.
2021; Baker et al. 2023). Recently, Jegatheesan et al. (2024) an-
alyzed a large sample of galaxies from the MaNGA survey and
found that galaxies with different morphologies follow distinct
assembly histories, with their bulge and disk components dis-
playing a wide diversity of metallicities and ages.

In this paper, we aim at studying the MZ,R of bulges for
the first time to our knowledge. We analyze the relation between
the scatter of the MZ,.R and the assembly history of the bulges.
While most of the stellar populations in the bulges are expected
to form in-situ (Gargiulo et al. 2019), a fraction could form in the
disk and then migrate (Debattista et al. 2023) or could even be
accreted (Romano et al. 2023). If bulges are composed by stars
formed from different channels, they might leave an imprint in
the bulge MZ,R.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the
simulations and the galaxy sample. In Section 3, we analyze the
bulge MZ.R and the contribution of stellar populations origi-
nating from different channels. Section 4 explores the various
formation scenarios. Finally, Section 5 presents our conclusions
and summarizes the main findings.

2. The CIELO galaxies

As mentioned above, cosmological simulations are powerful
tools to study the aforementioned diversity of processes that
could take place in the formation of bulges (e.g. Tissera et al.
2006; Gargiulo et al. 2022; Fragkoudi et al. 2017). Hence, in
this work, we use the cosmological simulations from the Chemo-
dynamlcal propertiEs of gaLaxies and the cOsmic web, the
CIELO Project (Tissera et al. 2025). These set of simulations
has been previously used to study the evolution of galaxies in the
Local Group (Rodriguez et al. 2022), the impact of baryons on
the dark matter shape (Cataldi et al. 2023), the channel of forma-
tion of stellar halos (Gonzalez-Jara et al. 2025), the shape of the
metallicity gradients (Tapia-Contreras et al. 2025) and the pos-
sible contribution of Primordial Black Holes to the dark matter
component (Casanueva-Villarreal et al. 2024). We note that the
CIELO galaxies have been already shown to determine a stellar
and star-forming gas MZR in global agreement with observa-
tions (Tissera et al. 2025).

Here we provide a description on the CIELO simulations and
the galaxy sample selected for this work.

2.1. The simulations

The CIELO project encompass cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations of zoom-in regions consistent with a A-CDM cos-
mological scenario with Q) = 0.317, Qa, = 0.6825, Qg =
0.049 and A = 0.6711 (Planck Collaboration et al. 2014). The
CIELO project includes zoom-in regions selected from a 50
Mpch~! side-box volume to cover a diversity of environments
while avoiding massive groups or clusters, as well as two Local
Group Analogs extracted from a 100 Mpc h™! side-box volume.
The target halos were selected to have virial masses in the range
[10!! — 10'3]M, and the surrounding region of about 1 Mpc ra-
dius was resampled at the same level of resolution. The initial
conditions are explained in detail in Tissera et al. (2025). Simu-
lations with two numerical resolution levels are used, with dark
matter particles of Mam = 2X10°Mo and mgm = 1.91 10°Mo for
the high and intermediate resolution level. The initial gas masses
are Meas = 3.12 104*Mo and Meas = 2.98 x 10°Mo, respectively.
For the high resolution level the gravitational softening length is
€am = 500 pe for dark matter, and €ga; = 250 pe for gas and stars.
The intermediate resolution one has values of €am = 800 pe and
€zas = 400 pe.

Details of the simulations can be found in Tissera et al.
(2025). Briefly, the simulations were performed by using a ver-
sion of GADGET-3 (Springel & Hernquist 2003; Springel 2005)
that includes metal-dependent radiative cooling and a multi-
phase treatment for the ISM (Scannapieco et al. 2006). A chem-
ical enrichment and energy feedback by Type Ia (SNIa) and
Type I (SNID) supernovae are also included (Mosconi et al.
2001; Scannapieco et al. 2005), following 13 individual iso-
topes. SNII are assumed to originate from stars more massive
than 8 Mo, with nucleosynthesis products from the metallicity-
dependent yields of Woosley & Weaver (1995) and lifetimes
from the mass—metallicity-dependent prescriptions of Raiteri
et al. (1996). For SNIa, the W7 model (Iwamoto et al. 1999) was
adopted, assuming progenitor lifetimes randomly distributed in
the range 0.7-1.1 Gyr, see Jiménez et al. (2015) for a discus-
sion on this. The number of SNIa events is estimated from an
observationally motivated SN II-to-SN Ia rate ratio (Mosconi
et al. 2001). The adopted initial mass function is consistent with
Chabrier & Lenoble (2023).

The virial halos were identified by using the Friend-of-
Friends algorithm (FoF, Davis et al. 1985) and the SUBFIND
code (Springel et al. 2001; Dolag et al. 2009) was applied to
select subhalos within the virial radius. The merger trees were
built by using the AMIGA package(Knollmann & Knebe 2009)
as explained by Tissera et al. (2025). We use the CIELO data
base prepared by Gonzalez-Jara et al. (2025).

2.2. The simulated galaxies

We selected 44 central galaxies defined as the most massive sys-
tem within a virial halo. The stellar masses of simulated galax-
ies are in the range of [107° — 10!°*] Mo. Alll selected galaxies
are resolved with more than 8000 stellar particles. We note that
galaxies with stellar masses lower than 10? Mo are selected from
the high resolution run only.

The dynamical components of the galaxies, bulge, disk and
stellar halos were identified by using the AM-E method as ex-
plained in Tissera et al. (2012). This method defines the circu-

cle, and J-,max is the maximum angular momentum possible for
a given binding energy, Epina- Hence, stars on perfect circular or-
bits in a plane have € = 1; conversely, dispersion-dominated sys-
tems have € ~ 0. This, together with a threshold in Eping, allows
the sorting of stellar particles into different components. The
bulge is defined by the stellar particles with Eping lower than the

minimum energy at 0.5 Rop:!, meaning that all stellar particles
with lower binding energies are classified as part of the bulge.
On the other hand, the disk component is defined as the stellar
particles with |e| > 0.5 and located within 2xRop. These criteria
have been previously used to study CIELO galaxies (Gonzalez-
Jara et al. 2025; Tissera et al. 2025; Tapia-Contreras et al. 2025),
so we kept them for consistency. With this classification, we
can also estimate the bulge-to-total mass ratio, B/T. The selected
galaxies have B/T within the range 0.20 to 0.85. Hence, our sam-
ple encompasses a broad variety of morphologies, with different
relative importance of the bulge and disc components.

Regarding the formation channels of the stellar populations
in the simulated bulge components, we followed all stellar parti-
cles back in time to their site of formation and classified them
accordingly. We grouped them as accreted if they were born
from material bound to accreted satellites at their time of for-
mation, and as in-situ if they were formed within the progen-
itor of a given galaxy (i.e. within 1.5 Rop:). The most massive
system in a halo is defined as the progenitor at a given time.
Furthermore, the in-situ stellar populations are also divided into
two subgroups, depending on whether they formed within the
bulge component, hereafter bulge-born (BB), or the disk com-
ponent,hereafter disk-born, (DB). In the latter case, these stars
migrated into the bulge, probably as a result of local instabilities
(Bournaud 2011) or tidally-induced torques produced by nearby
companions (Perez et al. 2013).

Figure | shows, as a function of bulge mass, the stellar mass
fractions, fx), of three distinct populations in the bulge, separated
by their formation channel, BB and DB and accreted. As can be
seen, the predominant formation channel is the in-situ formation
of stars from gas already present in the bulge (BB), with f,, vary-
ing from nearly 1 down to 0.60. However, as we go to higher
masses the contributions of accreted and DB increase slightly.
In particular, ~ 30% of the galaxies in the sample tend to have
accretion fractions (face) higher than facc= 0.20. Therefore, the
two main formation channels we identify are bulge-born (BB)
and accreted stars. However, some galaxies also show significant
contributions from DB populations’, as illustrated in Fig. 1.

To better quantify the origin of the accreted stellar popula-
tions, we identified the satellites to which the accreted material
was bound. This allows us to track the number of satellites that
contribute to the formation of a given stellar population in the
bulge. Figure 2 shows the cumulative accreted contribution to
the bulge as a function of the number of major contributors. To
obtain the major satellite contributors, we only include bulges
with accreted masses higher than 10° Mg and 10’Mb for the in-
termediate and high resolution simulations, respectively (i.e. if
bulges have at least 50 accreted particles). This is done to re-
duce numerical noise due to low number particles. We note that
our results do not depend on this adopted numerical limit if it
remains low, since we are mainly concerned about galaxies with
significant accretion fraction.

As can be seen Fig. 2 while there is a variety of accreted
fractions, most bulges reach at least 80% of their accreted stars
by the contribution of two or three accreted satellites. There is
a slight trend for bulges with facc< 0.2 to have a larger number
of contributors. This could be due to the accretion of stripped

! The optical radius, Rop, is defined as the one that enclosed 83 per
cent of the stellar mass of a galaxy.

? We acknowledge that numerical resolution could prevent or weaken
the formation of bars and that would have an impact on the fraction
of stars affected by secular evolution in our intermediate resolution run
(Fragkoudi et al. 2025) Hence, the fraction of DB could be considered
as a lower limit.

particles mainly at high redshift, where the assembly history is
more chaotic. These small bulges do not have main accretion
events.

3. The stellar mass-metallicity relation of bulges

We estimated the median [Fe/H] of the stellar populations in the
simulated bulges and disks and built the corresponding MZ,R°.
Figure 3 displays these relations and that of the galaxies as
a whole. The disk and the bulge components determine an
MZ.R with similar shapes, but with different level of enrich-
ment. The Pearson correlation coefficients (r) show well-defined
correlation for all cases (p-values are all lower than p < 0.001).
As can be seen in Fig. 3, the bulges tend to be more enriched
than the disks.

The simulated trends are consistent with those from the
MaNGA survey reported by Jegatheesan et al. (2024) (shaded
regions). We note that these authors applied BUDDI (Johnston
et al. 2017) to decompose bulge and disk components using two-
dimensional light profiles. This procedure is different from our
bulge and disc decomposition (see Section 2.1). Hence, we do
not aim at making a detail comparison but just to compare the
global trends of the corresponding MZ,R. To match the enrich-
ment levels between observations and simulations, we rescaled
the observational data to match the median abundances of the
CIELO galaxies at M..a, ~ 10°°Mo. This corresponds to a
downward shift in [Fe/H] of 0.21 dex. We make this correlations
since the methods to determine the abundances in observations
and simulations are different.

As shown in Fig. 3, bulges tend to be more enriched than
the disk components, although in some cases both exhibit simi-
lar levels of enrichment. This trend is expected considering the
bulges host stellar populations born in the central regions which
are very dense, and hence experienced strong starbursts. The
disks continued to accrete gas and form stars in a more steady

Lodders (2019).

fashion. Nevertheless, there is some overlap with a subsample
of galaxies that also exhibit enriched disks in agreement with
observations.

To compare the galaxy morphology and ages of the compo-
nents, Fig. 4 shows the MZ,R of the bulge and disk color-coded
by the galaxy B/T in the left panel, and the median age of the cor-
responding component in the right one. From the left panel we
see a weak secondary correlations with B/T, so that lower mass
galaxies tend to be more bulge-dominated. To quantify this de-
pendence, we estimated the correlation angle using Partial Cor-
relation Coefficients analysis (PCC, Bluck et al. 2020). For the
third correlation with B/T, the angle is 149 with a bootstrap error
of 20, suggesting a decrease of B/T for an increasing bulge M..
The right panel of Fig. 4 shows that more massive bulges tend
to be slightly older. The PCC analysis supports this with an an-
gle of 59 + 44. Considering the large bootstrap error, this angle
should be taken just as a reference of the relative direction of the
third correlation.

Regarding the disk components, the median MZ,R is de-
termined by the bulk of the systems, and the metallicity is
about 0.34 dex lower than that of the bulges. In the case of
MaNGA, the disk MZ,R is about 0.6 dex more metal-poor than
the bulges. However, some simulated disks exhibit higher metal-
licities. These systems lie along the bulge MZ,R (black con-
tours). Some of them display prominent disk components popu-
lated by younger stellar populations. They have median B/T of
0.49967 and median ages of 7.00:°.° Gyr. Meanwhile the bulk

5.31
of the disk components have median B/T of 0.65540 and me-

dian ages of 8.40)°3 Gyr (the upper and lower numbers cor-

respond to the 16" and 84" percentiles). Those galaxies with
younger disks continue their star formation probably due to con-
tinuous gas accretion, which also contributes to the formation of
the disks (Yu et al. 2023). However, our analysis shows an im-
portant variation of properties that reflect the complex formation
processes of bulges. In the preceding analysis, disk properties
have been included for completeness, but the analysis hereafter
focuses exclusively on the bulge components.

To further analysis the properties of the three stellar popu-
lation that form the bulges, we estimated the offset between the
metallicity of a given stellar population and the metallicity pre-
dicted by the bulge MZ,.R for the corresponding bulge mass as
[Fe/H] -[Fe/H]mz.r- Figure 5 compares the level of enrichment
and ages of BB (red), DB (yellow) and accreted (purple) stars.
The left panel of Fig. 5 shows the offset of metallicity as a func-
tion of the bulge stellar mass, while the right figure displays the
offsets as a function of the median age of each stellar population.
An important aspect of this estimation is that we only consider
a stellar population if it is resolved with more than 50 stellar
particles, in order to minimize numerical noise.

We find that the metallicity of the in-situ stellar popula-
tions is closer to the bulges MZ,R as expected, since they are
the predominant population. The DB populations exhibit enrich-
ment levels comparable to the BB ones, although they display
a mild trend of increasing metallicity with stellar mass. This
is likely due to the more enriched ISM of higher-mass galax-
ies, where these stars originated before migrating to the bulge.
Finally, the accreted stellar populations are in general less en-
riched, compared to the in-situ populations. This is expected
since the major contributors of these accreted stellar populations
to the bulges are low mass satellite galaxies, with less enriched
ISM. In Fig. C.1 we show the MZR of the three main satel-
lite contributors to the bulges together with the bulge MZR (see
Sec. C). From this figure, it is also clear that less massive satel-

lites entered the virial radius at higher lookback times and hence,
they did not have time for chemical evolution to take place.

The right panel of Fig. 5 shows that the accreted populations
tend to be as old as the in-situ bulge-born stars. The difference
between these two populations is the level of enrichment. Con-
versely, the DB stars present a wider range of ages, but in general
they are younger than the other populations. This is expected,
as disks typically form at later evolutionary stages and continue
forming stars over extended periods.

According to these results, accreted stars decrease the over-
all metallicity of the bulge, depending on the relevance of their

contribution. To quantify this effect, the left panel of Fig. 6
presents the bulge MZ,R color-coded by the facc. We applied the
LOESS2D algorithm to highlight the dependence on face (Cap-
pellari et al. 2013). For bulges with M. lower than 1085Mo,
there is no clear correlation between the metallicity relation and
the accretion fractions. However, the number of galaxies in this
mass range is too low to draw a conclusion. Conversely, for
M,> 108°Mg we do find a dependence on fcc, So that at a given
bulge mass, those with lower metallicity tend to have larger ac-
creted contribution.

As previously noted, some bulges also exhibit contributions
from DB stellar populations that migrate toward the central re-
gion. Hence, we also define fex-sity as the combined fraction
of accreted and DB stars. The right panel of Fig. 6 shows the
MZ,R as a function of fex—situ. Adding the DB contribution re-
inforces the trend initially seen with fice alone, indicating that
bulges with lower metallicities are associated with larger frac-
tions of stars formed outside the bulge.

by a threshold in Tso - T7 ~ 1 (red vertical line).

The PCC angle shows the direction at which the third corre-
lation, in this case with f,.- and fex-situ, increases with the bulge
MZ.R. The correlation angles, , present similar values for both
relations, with bootstrap errors lower than 4°. We stress the fact
that this trend is not a direct correlation between bulge mass and
total galaxy mass. Although bulge mass does correlate with stel-
lar mass along the MZ,.R (i.e. more massive bulges are typically
Ignacio Mufioz-Escobar et al.: Stellar mass-metallicity relation of bulges

found in more massive galaxies), this relation does not account
for the dispersion at a given bulge mass, as shown in Fig. B.1.

The trend to have lower metallicities in bulges with higher
Jace, at a given stellar mass, is clear. More massive galaxies are
expected to have more mergers, increasing the probability to
have a higher contribution of accreted stars in the bulge (An-
geloudi et al. 2024). Meanwhile, the contribution of DB stars
produce a similar effect because these stars are less enriched,
in general, as galaxies show negative metallicity profiles (Tapia-
Contreras et al. 2025).

We also include in both panels of Fig. 6, a zoom-in view of
the intermediate mass range (108° — 10!°M.) without LOESS2D
smoothing, to assess that there are not spurious results originated
by using this smoothing procedure. First we can see that results
hold, indicating that the less metal-rich galaxies tend to have
higher accretion fractions. Second, there are outliers, exhibit-
ing higher facc and higher metallicity (i.e. when a very massive
merger occurred) for example. Together, these findings highlight
the diversity of bulge assembly pathways.

In summary, we detect a MZ,R for bulges, which follows
the overall increasing trend of the galaxy MZ,R but at higher
enrichment levels. We find that part of the scatter in this rela-
tion is linked to the assembly history of bulges, such that those
with larger contributions from accreted and DB populations tend
to shift toward lower metallicity at a given bulge mass. Never-
theless, some systems deviate from this trend, and in the next
section we discuss the origin of this diversity.

4. Assembly histories of bulges and the MZ,.R

In order to further analyze the formation histories of the bulges,
we estimated the cumulated stellar mass as a function of age, and
calculated the lookback time at which 50% and 70% of the stellar
population in the bulges was formed, Tso and T79 respectively. In
Fig. 7 we show the metallicity offsets of individual bulges with
respect to the MZ,R , A[Fe/H]buiges, a8 a function of Tso — T7o.
The left panel shows the third dependence on f,.. while the right
panel shows the dependence on fex~situ-

The difference between these times provides a way to dis-
criminate between bulges with fast formation histories. From
this figure we can see that most of the bulges are concentrated
at Tso — T7o < 1 Gyr, implying Ts) ~ T7o. We adopt this age
threshold to define bulge with fast formation. The rest of the
system with with bursty or extended formation are assumed to
have Ts) — T7o > 1 Gyr. For our sample, we estimate that ~ 67%
of bulges are consistent with a fast formation path.

As can be seen in the left panel of Fig. 7, bulges with fast
formation and high accretion tend to have negative offsets. How-
ever, there are also bulges that fall below the median MZ,R that
have fast formation and low accretion. When we include both
fractions together, as shown the right panel of Fig. 7, we can
see that the trend is stronger and most fast forming bulges with
negative offsets have high f.x-situ. This can be understood be-
cause bulges with low accretion, facc< 0.2, and fast formation

have a median fp of 11.97°,’% for negative offsets and 5.8)°,° %

for positive offsets (upper and lower numbers represent the 16"
and 84" percentiles). The different fpg of offsets from the bulge
MZ.R suggest that migration of stellar populations from the disk
could also affect the median [Fe/H]. Some of them received old
and low metallicity stars while other have latter contributions of
younger, more metal-rich stars. There is only an exception, the
most massive bulge with a fast formation and a positive offset,
which had a major merger that contributed with high metallicity
stars.

On the other hand, bulges with bursty star formation and an
excess of [Fe/H] tend to have a larger fraction of fex-situ, which
is reinforced by the DB stars. We find that the fpp for low ac-
cretion is 5.853% for negative offsets and 0.055°% for positive
offsets. For high accretion fpp is 5.783% for negative offsets and
8. 184% for positive offsets. In this case, the larger contribution of
migrated stars could have brought more enriched material since
these bulges have an extended formation history. In fact, the DB
stars are in median ~ 2 Gyr younger for the bursty scenarios,
when compared to the fast forming ones, suggesting that they are
being form in a more enriched ISM. However, caution should be
taken regarding the results on bursty bulges because of the low
number of systems.

In summary, we find that bulges regarding of their forma-
tion history determine a MZ,R and that the dispersion of this
MZ.R_ is affected by both, stellar accretion from satellites and
migration from the disk, so that at a given bulge mass, those with
larger fex—sity tend to be less metal-rich.

5. Conclusions

We performed a chemo-dynamical analysis of the bulges of
44 central galaxies of the CIELO simulations. We built up the
MZ.R of bulges and showed that the dispersion at a given bulge
mass could be related to the accretion history.

Our main results can be summarized as follows,

— We found three channel of formation of the stellar popula-
tions in the CIELO bulges. Most of the stellar populations are
formed in-situ. However, about 33% of the simulated bulges
have facc> 0.2. The third channel of formation are stars born
in the disk component and later, acquired by the bulges via
secular evolution. They can contribute up to about 32% of
the stellar populations in the more massive bulges. A trend
with the bulge mass is found so that bulges with greater mass
have a more significant contribution of the last two channels.

— We found that bulges follow a MZ,R similar in shape to the
galaxy MZ.R, but, at least, for the CIELO simulations, with
a higher level of enrichment of about ~ 0.13 dex. The sim-
ulated bulge MZ.R is in global agreement with results from
the MaNGA survey and is driven mainly by the in-situ (BB)
stellar component.

— Accreted stars are found to be older and to have lower metal-
licity than in-situ stars, as expected, since they formed in
galaxies with lower mass than the central ones. Our results
show that most of the accreted material is provided by be-
tween two or three satellites utmost. The main satellite con-
tributors determine a MZR which is steeper and show a lower
level of enrichment than the bulge MZ,R.

— DB stellar populations tend to be younger than BB stars and
slightly more enriched in more massive systems, consistent
with having been formed from a more chemical enriched in-
terstellar medium in the corresponding disk components.

— Bulges with higher facc tend to have lower metallicity at a
given bulge mass. This trend is reinforced by adding fpp.
Hence, the bulge MZ,R stores relevant information of the
assembly history of the bulges, which is reflected in its dis-
persion of the MZ,R at a given stellar mass. This trend re-
sembled the behavior reported for the MZ,R of stellar ha-
los (D’Souza & Bell 2018, Gonzalez-Jara in prep), where
the dispersion is dominated by the most massive contribut-
ing satellite. In the case of the bulges, most of the stars are
formed in situ, but the dispersion at a given bulge mass is
modulated by the ex-situ stellar contribution.

These results reflects that the formation of the bulges in-
volves different formation paths that yields different chemical
enrichment. However, a MZ,R is clear at place driven mainly
by the in-situ stellar population, which is the dominating com-
ponent, but with a dispersion modulated by the impact of other
channels of formation related with stars formed ex-situ.

Appendix A: Effects of the bulge/halo
decomposition

The decomposition between bulge and disk relies on the bind-
ing energies at 0.5Rop:, as defined in Sec. 2.2, and the circular-
ity. This allow us to differentiate between inner-halo, less gravi-
ationally bounded, and bulge, more bounded. Nevertheless, to
better quantify the effects of considering the inner-halo as bulge
taking into account that observers usually take a fixed radius,
Fig. A.1 shows the different MZ,R of the bulges, when consid-
ering all stars within a given radius as bulge (without separating
components). As shown in Fig. A.1, considering the inner halo
produces a decrease of the overall metallicity of the bulge. This
is expected since the halo has shown to be formed by mainly
ex-situ stars that have lower metallicities (Gonzalez-Jara et al.
2025). However, except from the low-mass end, there are no sig-
nificant changes in the shape.

Appendix B: MZ,R and galaxy stellar mass

The dependence with the fraction of stars formed ex-situ might
also be affected by the stellar mass of the galaxy itself. To
test if the dispersion at a given bulge mass also correlates with
the galaxy mass, Fig. B.1 shows the MZ,R color-coded by the
galaxy mass. As expected larger bulges are found in larger galax-
ies. Nevertheless, the PCC analysis show an small positive angle,
highlighting that the dependence on the stellar mass of a galaxy
is small and the correlation with fex-situ is stronger at a given
bulge mass.

satellites.

The ISM from which stellar populations form is expected to de-
termine the chemical enrichment that they have. In that sense, the
accreted stars are born from gas that is expected to be from lower
mass satellites or less enriched. Figure C.1 shows the MZ.R of
the 3 major contributors for the bulges in the sample, at their time
of infall. Additionally, the bulge MZ,R of the central galaxies at

satellites that had more than 100 stellar particles to avoid nu-
merical noise. As expected from Fig. 5 they tend to have lower
masses, and to be more metal poor. Furthermore, as we move
to lower stellar masses, satellites tend to infall at earlier times of
the simulation . The median infall time of the satellites is 11.657:°
Gyr in lookback time (upper and lower numbers represent the
16" and 84" percentiles). These times are high, indicating that
the stellar population formed early. This is consistent with their
lower metallicities in comparison to the global populations of the
bulge at z = 0.
