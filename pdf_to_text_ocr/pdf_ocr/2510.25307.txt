Can quantum dynamics emerge from classical chaos?

Frédéric Faure*

Abstract. Anosov geodesic flows are among the simplest mathematical models of deterministic chaos. In
this survey we explain how, quite unexpectedly, quantum dynamics emerges from purely classical correlation
functions. The underlying mechanism is the discrete Pollicott—-Ruelle spectrum of the geodesic flow, revealed
through microlocal analysis. This spectrum naturally arranges into vertical bands; when the rightmost band is
separated from the rest by a gap, it governs an effective dynamics that mirrors quantum evolution.

1 Introduction.

1.1 Problem of prediction. A fundamental question in science, central to dynamical systems theory, is
whether one can predict the long-term behavior of a system from its short-term evolution law. Such questions
arise not only in physics but also in pure mathematics, including areas such as arithmetic and geometry.

1.2 Example in arithmetic. If the evolution law is simple to write down, one might expect the long-time
behavior to be simple to predict. In practice this is rarely the case, and this is the main difficulty encountered in
the “theory of deterministic chaos.” To illustrate this, let us present a very simple example of two closely related
deterministic laws, each defining a sequence t € N ++ 2(t) € N from an initial value x(0) € N.

First law.

This simple rule is called the geometric series. One can predict explicitly that for any t € N, a(t) = [ x(0)] »where

{-] denotes the ceiling function. Thus the sequence decays monotonically, and for any t > fun(0) one has z(t) = 1.

Despite its simple appearance, it remains the famous Collatz conjecture whether, for every initial value «(0) € N,
the sequence eventually falls into the cycle 1, 2,1,2,.... Numerically one observes a complicated (chaotic) transient
behavior. For instance, starting from (0) = 7, one obtains

7, 11, 17, 26,13, 20, 10, 5, 16,.8,:4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,1,...

(see Figure 1.1).

1.3. Example in geometry. For a smooth Riemannian manifold (WV, g), the geodesic flow (defined precisely
in Section 2.1) takes place on the unit cotangent bundle (T*\V),. In physics, the geodesic flow corresponds to the
motion of a free particle in the curved space (V,g), i.e. motion without external forces, following the “straightest
possible” path. Intuitively, for a smooth surface NV embedded in R°, starting from any point x € NV and any
direction V € T,.N, the geodesic flow can be visualized as a narrow adhesive tape on NV, lying flat without folds
and passing through (2, V) (see Figure 1.2).

initial values at t = 0.

Figure 1.2: An adhesive tape laid on a vase NV follows the geodesics of the surface. Similarly, a light beam follows
geodesics in a medium with spatially varying velocity c(q) > 0. In this case, the metric is conformal to the
Euclidean metric: gf = c(4) Guc-

Despite the simplicity of this deterministic evolution law, the long-time behavior of the geodesic flow may be
difficult to predict. Consider, for example, a closed hyperbolic surface (V, g), that is, one whose Gauss curvature
is « = —1 at every point. Figure 1.3(a) shows a single geodesic which appears highly chaotic, despite its unique
and deterministic nature. This illustrates the so-called paradox of “deterministic chaos” (see also the videos [44]).

Instead of considering the evolution of a single particle, one may simultaneously follow a smooth cloud of
independent particles starting from very close initial conditions. This situation will be described in precise
mathematical terms in Section 2 below. As illustrated in Figure 1.3(b), the cloud rapidly spreads over the
entire phase space (I*NV)1, which explains the previous impression of unpredictability for a single trajectory.
Theorem 2.5 below shows that the cloud spreads and converges exponentially towards the uniform measure on
(T*N),. This phenomenon is called exponential mixing, and it expresses the chaotic character of the geodesic
ow.

Tf one looks more closely, one observes fluctuations of the density of this cloud around the equilibrium state.
These fluctuations decay exponentially like e~'/?, where t denotes the evolution time. If one amplifies these
fluctuations by the factor e’/?, then, as shown in Figure 1.3(c), they behave like waves on NV’. This observation is
ormalized in Theorem 2.10 below (see also Section 3 for the special case of hyperbolic surfaces), and it constitutes
he main theme of this paper, raised by the question in the title: “Can quantum dynamics emerge from classical
deterministic chaos?” Indeed, the wave equation is usually regarded as the quantization of the geodesic flow,

1.4 Structure of the paper. In Section 2, we will introduce the mathematical model and state several
heorems that express this type of result for specific cases such as Anosov geodesic vector fields X.

The techniques involved are rich and fundamental in addressing these questions. First, Riemannian geometry
and contact geometry provide the framework to define the geodesic flow. Next, functional analysis, the spectral
theory of non self-adjoint operators, and semigroup theory are used to describe the evolution of smooth functions
on the phase space (I*V)1 over long times. But most importantly, microlocal analysis and symplectic geometry
are more than just technical tools: they reveal in a transparent way the hidden mechanisms underlying mixing
and the fluctuations of correlations for the Anosov geodesic flow.

A central outcome of microlocal analysis is the existence of a discrete Pollicott-Ruelle spectrum for the Anosov

vector field X, which manifests itself as resonances in the behavior of correlation functions (see Figure 2.3). The
exponential mixing property is explained by the presence of a dominant isolated eigenvalue at z = 0 in this
spectrum. The emergence of quantum dynamics, on the other hand, is related to the existence of an internal
spectral band separated from the rest of the spectrum by a spectral gap.

In Section 4 we discuss an important aspect of the evolution operator that is specific to deterministic dynamical
systems and expressed through the Atiyah—-Bott-Guillemin trace formula: the formal trace of e'* reveals the
periodic orbits. Since the trace is independent of the choice of basis, it can also be expressed in terms of the
discrete Ruelle eigenvalues of the vector field. From this, one can deduce further relations between periodic orbits
and the Pollicott-Ruelle spectrum, encoded in dynamical zeta functions, which are useful for various counting
problems [53],[22].

In Section 5 we explain the main steps leading to the central theorems presented in this paper: the discreteness
of the Pollicott-Ruelle spectrum and its band structure. We show how microlocal analysis is used to define
anisotropic Sobolev spaces, and how symplectic geometry enters, in particular through the linear symplectic
bundle TT*((T*N) 1) with the linearized approximation of the Anosov geodesic flow. We present the fundamental
mechanisms that appear in the linearized model, and which can be summarized by the heuristic slogan: “quantum
mechanics is the square root of classical dynamics.”

More technically, for a symplectic linear space F (here a fiber of TT*((T*NV)1)), there is a factorization
formula L?(F) = Spin, (F) ®Spin_(F), in terms of symplectic spinor spaces Spin, (F’) (thought of as “quantum
spaces”), and the pushforward operator (®')~°u := uo ®~ of a linear symplectic map ® on F (here the linearized
dynamics of the geodesic flow in the fibers) factorizes as (6")-° = Op(®") @ (C Op(®") C), where Op(®") denotes
Weyl quantization (a metaplectic operator) and C is complex conjugation.

In addition, since the dynamics is hyperbolic (as is the case for any Anosov geodesic flow), the second factor
converges, for large time, towards a rank-one projector (the “first band”), which plays a role analogous to the
ad-hoc Szeg6, Bergman, or Toeplitz projectors in standard geometric quantization. As a consequence, the classical
dynamics (®‘)~° is effectively described by the first factor Op(®*), ie. quantum dynamics emerges dynamically.

The final Section 6 is devoted to an informal discussion.

2 Correlation Functions for Anosov Geodesic Flows.

2.1 Anosov geodesic flow. We now recall the standard contact and symplectic structures underlying the
geodesic flow. Let (N’,g) be a smooth closed Riemannian manifold of dimension dim N = d+ 1 > 2. Let

M=(T'N)i:={pET'N; |[pllg =1}

be the unit cotangent bundle, and let 7: M — N be the natural projection.

We denote by A the canonical Liouville one-form on M, defined as follows: for p € M and a tangent vector
V €T,M, set q = 1(p). Then p € TN and (dr)(V) € T,N, and we set A,(V) := p((dt)(V)) € R. The form A
is a contact one-form, that is, dA is symplectic on ker. A. The volume form da = (dA)? A A is non-degenerate.

M=(T'N)|

Figure 2.1: Anosov vector field X on M = (T*N)).

Geometrically, the contact condition means that the distribution of hyperplanes ker.A is maximally non-
integrable. See Figure 2.1.

DEFINITION 2.1. The geodesic vector field X on M = (T*N), is defined by the conditions
(2.1) (dA) (X,.)=0, A(X) =1,

that is, X is the Reeb (or contact) vector field associated with A. Viewed as a differential operator, X generates
a flow ¢': M > M at time t E R, defined for all ue C®(M) by

@2) < (u ° 9") =X (u ° o') :

Remark 2.2. The one-form A is preserved by the geodesic flow, since its Lie derivative satisfies

(2.3) LxA = dixAt+ixdA = 0.
c (2.1)

Jartan

Consequently, the associated volume form is also preserved: Lx dx = 0.

THEOREM 2.3. [4//66]If (Ng) has strictly negative curvature, then the geodesic vector field X is Anosov.
That is, there exists a (Hélder) continuous splitting of the tangent bundle, invariant under the differential of the

flow do':
(2.4) TM=RX OL, OF.

Moreover, for t > 1, the action of dd‘ restricted to the unstable direction E,, is expanding, while its action
restricted to the stable direction E; is contracting. In other words, the geodesic flow is uniformly hyperbolic.

Remark 2.4. Theorem 2.3 expresses the property usually called sensitivity to initial conditions, often referred
to as the Butterfly effect. As a consequence, each trajectory has its own “unique story,” when considered over the
full time axis ¢ € R (past and future).

2.2 Correlation functions. As observed in Figure 1.3(a), an individual trajectory appears unpredictable
(chaotic). This is a consequence of the instability of each trajectory, as stated in Theorem 2.3. To overcome this
difficulty, one may regard a point as a Dirac measure and, more generally, consider the evolution of functions or
distributions, as illustrated in Figure 1.3(c).

The action of the flow ¢' on functions is given by the pullback operator. From (2.2), this defines a continuous

Figures 2.2 and 1.3(c) illustrate the effect of the operator e'* on a function u € C®(M) with small support.
From these observations, one sees that for large time t the evolved function e!* u develops structures at very fine
scales (i.e. high spatial frequencies).

If we choose to disregard these fine details and observe only the behavior that remains at the macroscopic
scale, it is natural to consider the scalar product of e'*u against a smooth function v € C®(M), viewed as an
“observable” or a “test function.” The objective is then to understand the asymptotics, as t + oo, of the function

2.3 Mixing.

THEOREM 2.5. [4//72/If (N,g) has negative curvature k <0, then the geodesic flow is (exponentially) mixing.
That is, for all u,v € C*(M) one has

2) ,e*u) pa = (v, Tou) p2 t

where Ig is the rank-one projector onto constant functions, defined by

Here the remainder satisfies R(t) = ou(1) as t > co (Anosov [4]). Moreover, Liverani [72] proved the sharper
estimate: there exists € > 0 such that, for all u,v, R(t) = Ou,(e~).

Remark 2.6. The mixing property (2.6) explains the convergence towards equilibrium observed in Figures 2.2
and 1.3. Indeed, it shows that after long times, the test function v detects only the constant function
1x (vatenls u) i More precisely, it asserts that (in a weak sense) the pullback operator converges to
the rank-one projector:

2.4 Pollicott-Ruelle resonances and eigenvalues. Let us consider the line vector bundle Fy =

|det B,| 1? — M,that is, the dual of half-densities on the stable bundle E, (see (2.4)). The vector field
X extends naturally as a differential operator X-, on the space of sections of Fy. We then define
(2.7) f= lim log [leo ||"! <0
. Yo ° t+400 alk L=(M;Fo) .
For a hyperbolic surface, one has the explicit value Ww = -5; see Section 3.

Tsujii [90] improved Theorem 2.5 by showing that, up to the decay rate ent (not optimal in general),
one has a finite expansion of e!* over finite-rank spectral projectors. This means that there exist operators
Il; : C*(M) — S'(M), j > O,satisfying ILI, = 6;=, 0;.1;X = X1;. Assuming, for simplicity, that there
are no Jordan blocks, this expansion reads: Vu,v € C® (T7N) ,Ve > 0, 4J- such that

with zo = 0, which already appears in (2.6) and corresponds to the mixing term. Possibly, only one or finitely
many projectors occur. The other resonances lie in the strip

yo < R(z;) <0, J21,

see Figure 2.3(a).

For hyperbolic surfaces, expansion (2.8) was proved by Ratner [82]. For the Bolza hyperbolic surface, there
are no eigenvalues with R(z) > -4 = os except the leading one zp = 0.

An equivalent fornmlation of (2.8) is that the resolvent

z€ {R(z) > O} HS (z- X)7!: C%(M) + S'(M)

admits a meromorphic continuation to the half-plane {R(z) > yg}, with poles of finite rank at z € {zj};. These
poles are called Pollicott—Ruelle resonances, see Figure 2.3.

In fact, Tsujii’s result given in the next theorem is stronger: these poles (or resonances) (Aj); are discrete
Pollicott-Ruelle eigenvalues of the geodesic vector field X in a suitably defined anisotropic Sobolev space H(M/)
of distributions containing C°(M). That is,

ze (z-X)7!: H(M) > H(M)
is bounded except at a discrete set of poles, where the associated spectral projectors have finite rank.
THEOREM 2.7. /90, thm 1.1]There exists an anisotropic Hilbert space

|Sz| > C. and R(z) > yg +, one has
-1
II(z -X) laxeceney < Ce.

In other words, the resolvent is uniformly bounded to the right of yf, except in neighborhoods of a finite
number of eigenvalues (see Figure 2.3(a)). This property is equivalent to discreteness of the eigenvalues (or
quasi-compactness) of

é* :Hw(M) > Hw(M)

in the region {|2| > e0 +9}, for t > 0.

It has been possible to extend the analysis further to the left in the complex spectral plane: Butterley and
Liverani [21] proved that the resolvent

z€C > (z—X)7':C*”(M) + S'(M)

admits a meromorphic continuation to the whole complex plane C. The poles of this continuation are the Pollicott—
Ruelle resonances. More precisely they showed that for any C > 0, there exists an anisotropic Sobolev space (or
Banach space) C°(M) C Hw(M) c S’(M) such that

X: Hw(M) > Hw(M)

has a discrete Pollicott—-Ruelle spectrum in the half-plane R(z) > —C. In this framework, the Pollicott—Ruelle
resonances are realized as genuine eigenvalues of X on Hw(M). These results have been obtained after using
microlocal analysis [46].

By contrast, there are models where one knows that the resolvent admits a meromorphic extension (hence
discrete resonances), but it is not known whether these resonances can be realized as eigenvalues. Examples
include the Laplacian A on the Poincaré disk D?, or cusps in [16].

However, these results do not provide much information on the existence or on the precise location of the
discrete Pollicott-Ruelle spectrum. In particular, one cannot deduce an expansion such as (2.8) or (2.9) for
correlation functions with a remainder term bounded by O (e-“) ,for arbitrarily large C' > 0.

2.5 Resonances and the Pollicott-Ruelle Discrete Spectrum in Anisotropic Sobolev and
Banach Spaces. Before continuing, let us give a brief and partial overview of works and progress on resonances.
A recent reference on the subject is the book by Dyatlov and Zworski [42].

As defined above in (2.8), resonances appear as the discrete leading contributions to correlation functions.
This concept originates in physics, from the scattering of waves: for instance, acoustic resonances in Helmholtz
resonators (1863), resonances in electromagnetism such as fluorescence, and in nuclear physics through radioac-
tivity with the introduction of resonant “Gamow states” by Gamow and Breit-Wigner, characterized by complex
energies F = E, — iT and by poles of the scattering matrix.

In mathematics, starting in the 1960s, Lax and Phillips [69] and others developed a rigorous framework
for scattering theory and resonances. In the early 1970s, Aguilar-Combes and Balsley-Combes introduced the
complex scaling method [1, 12], which shows that on Euclidean spaces, scattering resonances can be realized
as eigenvalues in certain “anisotropic analytic spaces.” This method was subsequently extended in a microlocal
framework by Helffer and Sjéstrand in the 1980s [61], and further by Gérard and Martinez in the 1980s~1990s [52],
among others.

These results concern mainly the wave equation, Schrédinger-type equations, and other PDEs in open settings
or with scattering phenomena, in particular scattering in phase space on a trapped set (see [61]).

In the domain of hyperbolic (Anosov) dynamical systems, the situation is analogous, since one has scattering
phenomena in the cotangent bundle on the trapped set [45]. Ruelle [83, 84] and Pollicott [81] introduced the
concept of Pollicott-Ruelle (PR) resonances for correlation functions.

Subsequently, many results have progressively developed the theory of anisotropic Sobolev or Banach spaces,
in which the dynamics is modeled by an operator with discrete PR spectrum. Contributions include the works of
Rugh [85, 86], Blank, Keller and Liverani [13], Baladi and Tsujii [6, 7, 10, 11], Butterley, Liverani and Tsujii [73,
21, 90, 91], Gouézel and Liverani [55], Naud [75, 76, 74], Faure, Roy and Sjéstrand [45, 46], Nonnenmacher
and Zworski [80], Datchev, Dyatlov and Zworski [30, 34, 39, 40, 41, 42, 35], Dyatlov and Guillarmou [38],
Bonthonneau [14], Bonthonneau and Jézéquel for Gevrey Anosov dynamics with FBI transform [15], and Jin,
Tao and Zworski [64, 65], among many others. This vast body of work has established the PR spectrum as the
natural spectral invariant of Anosov flows.

Dolgopyat [32, 33] developed a very powerful approach for partially hyperbolic systems (see also [72]), based
on oscillatory cancellation techniques for transfer operators which has proved extremely useful and has led to
strong results, see e.g. [92, 93].

Specific models have been investigated in various settings, such as homogeneous spaces by Dyatlov,
Faure, Guillarmou, Hilgert, Weich, Wolf, and Kiister [37, 57, 62, 67], Morse-Smale flows by Dang and
Riviére [26, 27, 28, 29], and dispersive billiards by Baladi, Demers and Liverani, Chaubet and Petkov [9, 8, 24].
There have also been important applications, including Fried’s conjecture and related topological aspects

(Chaubet, Dang, Dyatlov, Guillarmou, Riviére, Shen, Zworski, Kiister and Weich) [25, 41, 68, 23], the marked
length spectrum and geometric inverse problems, as well as the X-ray transform and rigidity, studied by
Guillarmou, Lefeuvre, and Gouézel [58, 54, 70], counting closed trajectories [53],[22].

In particular, the question of the band structure of the Ruelle spectrum and the emergence of quantum
dynamics, which is the focus of this paper, was already investigated in [43] for a contact extension of the cat map
and in [47] in a more general setting. In [48], the associated semiclassical zeta function is studied. More recently,
Cekic and Guillarmou [56] proved the existence of the first band for contact Anosov flows in dimension three
using horocycle operators. Below, we give details on the paper [49].

For the special case of hyperbolic manifolds endowed with an algebraic structure, i.e. high symmetry described
by Lie groups, the band spectrum of Anosov dynamics has been studied in [37, 57, 62]. In different contexts, band
structure and Weyl laws for the spectrum of resonances were investigated by Stefanov and Vodev [88], Sjéstrand
and Zworski [87] for convex obstacles, and by Dyatlov [34] for regular normally hyperbolic trapped sets.

2.6 Band structure of the Pollicott Ruelle spectrum. In Section 2.4 we recalled that a general
Anosov vector field X has a discrete spectrum of Pollicott—Ruelle resonances, that is, discrete eigenvalues in
suitable anisotropic Sobolev spaces. At present, however, almost nothing is known in general about the precise
existence or location of these resonances.

The situation is different for Anosov geodesic flows (or more generally Anosov contact flows), for which the
contact form A is preserved (see (2.3)).

vt <% =0,

which gives a first band accumulating on the imaginary axis, with a spectral gap on its left-hand side (see
Figure 2.3(b)).

A technical difficulty arises because the bundle E, + M is not smooth. To circumvent this, in [48] we work
instead with a larger but smooth Grassmannian bundle.

3 Pollicott-Ruelle spectrum of X for a hyperbolic surface. In this section we explain how to obtain
the band structure of the Pollicott—Ruelle spectrum (Theorem 2.9) in the special case of the geodesic flow on a
compact hyperbolic surface, using the algebraic structure of SL2R. These arguments are classical in Selberg’s
theory and appear prominently in the work of Flaminio and Forni [51]. We follow here the approach of [37]; see
also [57, 62, 3, 19, 18, 20].

A compact hyperbolic surface is a closed Riemannian surface (NV, g) with constant negative curvature « = —1.
An example is the Bolza surface, illustrated in Figure 1.3. Such a surface can be realized as a double coset quotient

4 Relation with periodic orbits: trace formula and dynamical zeta functions. In this section we
recall an exact and fundamental relation linking the Pollicott—Ruelle spectrum to the periodic orbits of an Anosov
geodesic flow. This relation arises naturally from the fact that we are working with the pullback operator (2.5),
and it plays a central role in orbit-counting problems and related applications.

4.1 The Atiyah-Bott-Guillemin formula. For u € C°(M), x € M, and t € R, the pullback operator
can be written as
(eXu)(x) = u(d'(x)) = | Ki(2,2')u(2’) de’,
(2.5) M
where the distributional Schwartz kernel is given by K;(x,2’) = 5(a! = ¢'(2)), that is, the kernel is supported
on the graph of the flow. Taking the trace therefore picks out the periodic points of the flow.

A point x € M such that $7(x) = x for some T > 0 is called a periodic point with period T. If T > 0
is minimal, ic. ¢'(x) # @ for all 0 < t < T, then T is the primitive period, and the corresponding orbit
7 := {¢'(a) ; t € [0,T)} is called a primitive orbit, with length |y| := T. More generally, ¢"'7!(x) with n > 1 also
yields periodic points belonging to the same orbit.

THEOREM 4.1. [5][59] “Atiyah-Bott-Guillemin trace formula”. The distributional trace

M

is well defined as a distribution in D’(R:), and one has

(4.1) Re*)= YW Wy 6(t=nhy/)

y:primitiveorbit — n>1 |aet (a — (d¢*) Daven, )|

Proof. By definition,
Tr(e'*) := | Ki(ee)de = [ ix — $'(2)) dx,
M JM

so the integral localizes on the periodic points of the flow. Near a periodic point m € M, we choose local
coordinates (x,z) € R?¢ x R such that the hyperplane {z = const} is tangent to E,(m) ® E,(m). Then the
differential reads d((x, 2) — '(x,z)) ~ (Id- do 'n. on, (©), 0). We now use the general fact: if f : R" + R” has a
fixed point f(0) = 0, then

. 1 1
[ose ~ Tdet DFO) / Sy) dy = [det DFO] q

Applying this to the flow near m, and integrating along the orbit, produces the factor |7y| corresponding to its
primitive period. This gives precisely formula (4.1).

Just as for the trace of a matrix, the flat trace Tr’ (e'*) does not depend on the choice of a (reasonable) basis.
This suggests interpreting and using the Pollicott—Ruelle spectrum of X as providing a “spectral decomposition”
of the operator e'*.

4.2 Dynamical zeta functions. Dynamical zeta functions provide a convenient way to exploit the trace
formula (4.1) and to deduce a relation between the Pollicott—Ruelle spectrum and periodic orbits.

THEOREM 4.2. /53]/39/Let X be an Anosov vector field. For R(z) > 0, the dynamical zeta function is defined
by
enn

det ((1a — (dgn'!) (7) in.on.)|

where the outer sum runs over primitive periodic orbits y of X. This series converges for R(z) > 0, and the
function d: z++ d(z) extends holomorphically to the whole complex plane C. Moreover, its zeros coincide with
the Pollicott-Ruelle eigenvalues, counted with multiplicities.

Remark 4.3. A similar result was obtained earlier for Anosov diffeomorphisms by Baladi and Tsujii [11].

Let us indicate the origin of the somewhat complicated expression (4.2), and outline the proof. The guiding
idea is to mimic the case of a finite-dimensional matrix A (or a finite-rank operator), for which the eigenvalues
are the zeros of the holomorphic function d(z) = det(z — A).

Indeed, one has

(g-A) t= [ e AN dt, d(z) = det(z — A) = exp(Tr(log(z — A))).

Differentiating gives

d oo
a log d(z) = Tr(z— A)7! | e-*' Tr(e'4) dt
ze 0

For z ¢ Spec(A), this can be integrated to yield
z

oo
: 1 2 A
d(z) = d(zo) vexp(— tim [ ¥e *Tr(e'*) dt
Replacing Tr(e'4) by its dynamical analogue, namely the flat trace Tr?(e’*) from (4.1), and using that
Tr’(e'*) = 0 for 0 <t < |y|min, we obtain

[ 1 —#T(et®) dt “EE enh
eX] — oe 2: I ve. au => ex,
PL Arslan € PL 4+ 2 [det — "MN Dizwoe. |’

which is exactly the definition (4.2) of the dynamical zeta function.
On the other hand, the poles of the resolvent z ++ (z — X)~" are precisely the Pollicott—Ruelle eigenvalues of
X, and a careful analysis shows that these correspond to the zeros of d(z), thus giving Theorem 4.2.

4.3 Semiclassical zeta function As explained in section 2.7 it is interesting to consider the action of the
geodesic vector field on sections of the “semi-classical” bundle F = |detE,|*!/? (half-densities on E,) . Indeed
observe that we have

det ((Id - (d6") M)/r,0n.)] w= det (164, ) * |aet (11a - (a8) yeoe,)|
-1/2

and det (40%, =e 2S divX/2y 59 formally

Tr ((e'*F) ,,,) [det ( (Id - (de) )je.00)| &,, eet (ld - (ao) )eor.)| ;

The “semi-classical zeta function” has been defined by Voros (and others) [94] by

—zn|y|

(4.3) dsc (Z) -= exp | — > > ~ 1/2
7 nein |act (ia — (dd) Daven, )|

and has the following property, (see figure 2.3 (b)). Recall that 7° < 0.

THEOREM 4.4. [48]/The semi-classical zeta function dsc (z) well defined for Re(z) > 1, has an meromorphic
extension on C. For any Ve > 0, on Re(z) > yb +6, dsc (z) has finite number of poles and its zeroes coincide (up
to finite number) with the Ruelle eigenvalues of Xp that accumulate on the imaginary axis.

One motivation for studying ds. (z) comes from the Gutzwiller semiclassical trace formula in quantum chaos

[60]. In particular in the case of a hyperbolic surface, presented in section 3, ds- (z) coincides (up to a shift)

5 Microlocal mechanisms underlying the band structure. In this section we explain how microlocal
analysis leads to Theorem 2.9 and Theorem 2.10, emphasizing the main steps. What follows is a short summary
of the proofs presented in [49].

5.1 Microlocal analysis on M = (I*N),. Recall the geodesic vector field X on M in definition 2.1.
We have dimM = 2d+1. On M, we consider local flow box coordinates y = (2,z) € R24 x R., ie. st.
X= £ and dual coordinates n = (€,w) € R?¢ x R on the fiber TM. We introduce a family of wave packets
(yn) €T*M + yn) € C® (M). Their precise definition is given in [49]. Here, with some abuse of notations that.
forget charts and partitions of unity, we just notice that at high frequency |7| > 1, their expression is closed to a
Gaussian wave packet

oa i { (M) + S(T*M)

u > {(y,n) + (Tu) (yn) = (Gyins @) 22(M) }
that has the fundamental property called “resolution of identity”:
ToT =Id.

With the wave packet transform isometry 7, analysis of functions M is transformed as an analysis of functions
on T*M. We will study the lifted operator of the geodesic ow Te!* T?. See figure 5.1.

In fact the construction of wave packets (5.1) and the transform 7 is based on the choice of a metric’ g on
T*M, compatible with Q = dy A dn,

The geometrical meaning is that the unit boxes for the metric g correspond to the effective size of wave packets
and reflect the uncertainty principle. Technically it is convenient to work with wave packet transform instead of
the usual Pseudo Differential Operators (PDO) calculus [89], because in Anosov dynamics most of the structures
are not smooth but only Holder continuous. With the wave packet transform in (5.2), these fractal structures can
be ignored at a scale smaller that the unit ball of the metric g.

We have the fundamental estimate [50] closely related to the "theorem of propagation of singularities”

Figure 5.2:

Eq.(5.4) express that the Schwartz kernel of Te'* Tt on T*M x T*M is negligible outside the graph of the induced
flow (d¢')* : T*M > T*M.

The Anosov property (2.4) gives dual directions E*, E*,X = (Ey ® E.)* = RA in cotangent space and we
observe that the lifted dynamics (dd‘)” is a “scattering dynamics” on the trapped set © = RA c T*M
(Liouville 1-form), ie. © is an invariant normally hyperbolic submanifold, dim= = 2(d+1) and X\ {0} is
symplectic since A is contact. See figure 5.2.
From this geometric situation we can now follow and adapt the well established strategy of Helffer-Sjostrand
1986 [61] for quantum resonances (here classical PR resonances).

5.2 Pollicott-Ruelle spectrum of X. In the outer part of ©, where trajectories go to infinity in the past
or future, we can put a weight W : T*M — R* such that W o (dd")* decays with t > +oo and W =1ina
vicinity of the trapped set ©. We define a weighed Hilbert space, called anisotropic Sobolev space:

(5.6) Hw (M) := fue C® (M) st. WTu € 2 (T*M)}.

An immediate consequence is that the operator e'* : Hy (M) — Hw(M) has a “negligible contribution”
outside © so only the dynamics of (d¢')” in a vicinity of D plays a role for e'*.

At that point, we have enough to deduce some discrete Pollicott-Ruelle spectrum of X : Hw (M) > Hw(M).
This has been done as done in [46] with usual PDO calculus or [50] as explained here, also in [15] for Gevrey or
analytic Anosov flows.

5.3 Linearized dynamics and symplectic spinors. To go further and reveal the band structure of the
PR spectrum, we fix some exponent 0 < <1. At every point p = wA(m) € ¥ of the trapped set, with m € M
and w > 1, we consider a vicinity of p of g—size x w/? > 1. From the expression (5.3) of the metric g, this
implies that the projection this ball on M has a tiny size x w~(-)/? < 1 if w >> 1. Hence this will allow us to
use the linearization of the dynamics d(d¢')* :TT*M + TT*M asa good local approximation, w > 1. See
figure 5.2.

Now we enter the setting where the relevant phenomena take place.

Recall that the trapped set © C T*M is symplectic and normally hyperbolic. Hence at every point
p=wA(m) € >, there is a decomposition invariant by the dynamics d(dd")* (a “micro-local” decoupling)

A.
T,0°M = 7,2 S(Nu(p) © Ne(p))
wy ee. _—r_———<——S

Tangent Normal N()

and we can treat the linearized dynamics separately along the tangential direction T,© and along the normal
direction N (p).

Here we use a simple but important property of linear symplectic maps explained in [43, eq.(43)] and [50,
thm C.33], which is that they factorize into two quantum (spinoral) components. Here, concerning the linear
symplectic map ® := d(d¢')” on TT*M, it expresses the pull back operator 6° : u+> wo ® as a tensor product
of two metaplectic operators Op (®ry), Op (®y), each is the Weyl quantization of the linear symplectic map

® restricted to the respective component TX or N:
(5.7) &° = Op(®ry) @ Op (Oy).

This simple formula (5.7) has a profound meaning: on the left, the “classical dynamics” factorizes into two
quantum dynamics. More precisely, one can show that ®y is conjugate to dd’ : Ker(A) — Ker(A) and ®7y
is conjugate to C(d¢')C, where C denotes complex conjugation. Thus, at the level of linear symplectic maps,
quantum dynamics appears as a “square root” of classical dynamics. For this reason, the spaces on which these
metaplectic operators act are sometimes called *symplectic spinors* in the literature.

This factorization is, however, quite surprising: each “quantum component” carries an uncertainty principle,
but when combined their tensor product cancels these effects, reproducing the classical pullback operator ®°,
which transports Dirac measures to Dirac measures. For general symplectic dynamics observed in L?-spaces, the
two quantum components are always present, but they remain “hidden” inside this tensor product.

Time evolution reveals the tangential quantum factor: The dynamics we are interested in is hyperbolic, and
with the weight (or escape function) W in (5.6) we observe the two components differently: the tangential dynamics
Op(®rx) acts in an L? space, while the normal dynamics Op(®y) acts on an anisotropic Sobolev space. Recall
that this anisotropic setting is the natural framework for analyzing correlation functions of the Anosov flow.

Let us consider the normal operator Op (ny) where @y is hyperbolic, in fact conjugated to the linear
symplectic map d@! : E,, @ E, + E, © E,. This gives that Op (®y) is conjugated to

(5.8) Op" (dé) = |det (a6, ) |” (a6 p,)”

with a contracting linear map dd) p,- This operator preserves the finite rank vector bundle Fj, = |detB,|-'/? ®

Pol (Es) constructed with homogeneous polynomials of degree k, introduced in (2.10) and that belong to the
anisotropic Sobolev space. We have the estimates 2.11, so that for large time t > 1, the first band k = 0 with
rank one bundle Fo emerges®.
The effect of the long-time dynamics is to eliminate the second factor in (5.7), which is asymptotically replaced
by a rank-one projector. What remains is the first, unitary quantum factor Op(®ry) acting on the tangent space.
This is precisely how quantum dynamics emerges.
Remark 5.1. Technically, this reduction, naturally produced by the dynamics, can be compared with the
ad-hoc procedure of geometric quantization, where one projects the evolution of functions onto a subspace of
“polarized sections” using a Szegé, Bergman, or Toeplitz projector. The crucial difference is that in geometric
quantization the image of the projector is not invariant under the dynamics, whereas here the projection is
generated by the dynamics itself and is invariant by definition (assuming the presence of a spectral gap).

5.4 Band structure of the Pollicott-Ruelle spectrum. After this step, we can re-construct the global
situation for the Anosov geodesic flow that we aim to study. In [49], we introduce a semi-classical calculus on
sections C'(X; Fx) with the vector bundle F, = |detB,|-1/? ® Pol, (Es) over the symplectic trapped set U. We
obtain associated projectors Opy, (Z;) similar to the Bergman (or Szegé ) projector in geometric quantization,
but here, they are (approximately) invariant.

Assuming Vea <1, we deduce that the discrete Pollicott-Ruelle spectrum of X in Hy (M) is contained in
vertical bands B;,,,k € N with gaps where the resolvent is uniformly bounded. This gives theorem 2.9 and figure
2:3:

Moreover, the effective semi-classical calculus on C (5; F;,) gives also a precise Wey] law (these techniques
are similar to second micro-localization techniques in other papers).

6 Informal discussion. We conclude with an informal discussion, intended to put the results into
perspective. These considerations have motivated the work presented in this paper. For further discussions,
see [43, 47].

From a physical viewpoint, two striking similarities can be noted:

1. Theorem 2.14 shows that the evolution of probability measures under a deterministic yet chaotic flow
(Anosov geodesic flow) splits into an equilibrium measure plus small fluctuations, the latter governed by an
effective Schrédinger-type equation—hence a form of “quantum dynamics” emerges.

2. In physics, phenomena are described within the quantum wave formalism, with the Born rule p(x) da =
|wb(x)|? dx, suggesting a probabilistic structure possibly arising from deeper deterministic laws.

One may then ask whether the situations in 1 and 2 point to a deterministic origin of quantum mechanics (see,

From a mathematical viewpoint, quantization is a procedure assigning to a symbol a € C ~(T*Ri e) an
operator Op(a) : L?(R”) > L?(R”) (see [89, 31, 95]). For example, Op(€;) = —i0,,. For a geodesic flow on
(N,g), the symbol a(z,€) = ||||g yields (up to lower-order terms) the wave operator VA © Op((|lé||,), with
A = did the Hodge Laplacian generating the wave equation O,u, = iVA ui (hence 0?u, = —Auz).

Semiclassical analysis (WKB, Egorov, etc.) shows that in the short-wave limit \<1, solutions u, propagate
along geodesics— as in geometrical optics or the classical limit of quantum mechanics. Remarkably, Theorem 2.14
describes the reverse process:

geodesic flow = quantum dynamics,

whose precise meaning remains open.

Quantization is not unique: distinct pseudodifferential quantizations sharing the same classical symbol may
have different spectra (e.g. Weyl vs. geometric quantization). In Theorem 2.14, the operator A = ITjo,o)XTIo,0)
acts as a canonical quantization intrinsically defined by the Anosov flow. Its spectrum coincides with the zeros of
the dynamical zeta function (Theorems 4.2, 4.4), suggesting a privileged link with quantum chaos (see [79, 36, 2]).
