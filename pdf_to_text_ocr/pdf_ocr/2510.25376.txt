Direct laser acceleration (DLA) offers a compact source of high-charge, energetic electrons for gen-
erating secondary radiation or neutrons. While DLA in high-density plasma optimizes the energy
transfer from a laser pulse to electrons, it exacerbates nonlinear propagation effects, such as fila-
mentation, that can disrupt the acceleration process. Here, we show that superluminal flying-focus
pulses (FFPs) mitigate nonlinear propagation, thereby enhancing the number of high-energy elec-
trons and resulting x-ray yield. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations show that, compared
to a Gaussian pulse of equal energy (1 J) and intensity (2 x 10°° W/cm?), an FFP produces 80x
more electrons above 100 MeV, increases the electron cutoff energy by 20%, triples the high-energy
x-ray yield, and improves x-ray collimation. These results illustrate the ability of spatiotemporally
structured laser pulses to provide additional control in the highly nonlinear, relativistic regime of

laser-plasma interactions.

I. INTRODUCTION

Laser-driven sources of energetic electrons hold
romise for a wide range of applications and fundamental
studies, including electron radiography [1-4], neutron [5—
7] and radiation generation [8-13], and measurements of
strong-field quantum electrodynamical phenomena [14—
6]. The extreme intensities required for the highest en-
ergy sources inevitably involve plasma due to the mate-
rial breakdown limitations of solid-state or gaseous me-
dia. Intense, ultrashort laser pulses propagating through
lasma accelerate electrons either directly, in the elec-
romagnetic fields of the pulse itself, or indirectly, in the
quasi-static fields that it drives. The direct laser accel-
eration (DLA) mechanism harnesses both processes: the
first to energize electrons, and the second to laterally
confine them, which facilitates their energy gain through
he first process [17]. The resulting high-efficiency trans-
fer of laser energy to high-charge electron bunches has
made DLA an attractive source that complements other
aser-based approaches [18-24].

As an intense laser pulse propagates through plasma,
its leading edge expels electrons from its path, forming a
asma channel. A population of electrons, either from
he background plasma or edges of the channel, are in-
jected into pulse, where they gain energy through its
ransverse electric field. The transverse momenta of these
electrons are then rotated into the longitudinal direction
oy the magnetic field of the pulse. The quasi-static elec-
ric and magnetic fields generated during the formation
the plasma channel enhance the energy gain by pro-
iding transverse confinement [25] and driving transverse
etatron) oscillations [26]. When the Doppler-shifted

laser frequency experienced by an electron becomes com-
parable to its betatron frequency, its transverse velocity
can remain nearly antiparallel to the transverse electric
field of the pulse over many cycles. The electron then
gains energy with each oscillation.

While DLA can occur in low density plasma, the high-
est efficiencies and highest charge bunches are produced
in plasmas where the electron density is comparable to
he critical density—the density at which the plasma
becomes opaque [23]. At these near-critical densities,
self-focusing, filamentation, and hosing can destabilize
pulse propagation [27-29], disrupting the structure of the
quasi-static fields that are essential for sustained energy
gain [21, 30]. To mitigate such instabilities, approaches
based on structured targets, such as pre-fabricated micro-
channels [31] or channels created by precursor pulses [32]
have been explored. These approaches, however, intro-
duce their own challenges for experimental implementa-
ion, motivating the search for alternatives.

Flying-focus pulses (FFPs) offer a structured-light ap-
proach to stabilizing laser pulse propagation. FFPs
eature an intensity peak that travels at an arbitrary,
controllable velocity over distances far exceeding the
Rayleigh range [33-37]. These features have been ex-
perimentally demonstrated using chromatic focusing of
chirped laser pulses [34, 38-40] and axilens focusing of
pulses prepared by a radial echelon or refractive dou-
blet [41, 42]. The controllable velocity and extended
interaction lengths afforded by FFPs benefit several
laser-plasma applications, including electron acceleration
[35, 36, 43] and radiation generation [44~46]. Of partic-
ular note for DLA, FFPs have stabilized the propaga-
tion of low-intensity laser pulses in the formation of low-
density plasma channels by mitigating ionization refrac-
tion [47, 48]. The open question, which we address here,
is whether the controllable velocity of a high-intensity
flying-focus pulse can be used to stabilize a high-density

= 0.16 n-. The GP becomes highly modulated
idly self focuses before breaking up into multi-

ple filaments. The FFP, although also highly modulated,
undergoes weaker self-focusing and resists filamentation.
This improved stability of the FFP is due to the super-
luminal velocity of its intensity peak. The front of a
superluminal FFP focuses deeper into the plasma than
he back. As a consequence, the back of the pulse forms a
high-intensity focus before having to propagate through
asma that has been disturbed by the front. Meanwhile,
he front remains at lower intensity and traverses largely
undisturbed plasma until it reaches its focus. The weaker
asma modifications experienced by the back and driven
y the front mitigates self-focusing and filamentation,
abilizing propagation. This contrasts with a GP where
he back of the pulse must propagate through plasma
hat has been strongly disturbed by the front, causing an
accumulation of nonlinear refraction and focusing along
he propagation path.

QB

A key component of DLA in high-density plasma is the
formation of a channel, created when the leading edge o
a laser pulse expels electrons leaving behind a positively
charged column. The bottom row of Fig. 1 shows the den-
sity of the channel and the electrons accelerated within
it. By propagating more stably, the FFP drives a wider,
more uniform channel. This leads to a greater number o
high-energy electrons and a larger cutoff energy regard-
less of the background density [Fig. 1(c)]. For instance,
at the optimal density of 0.08 n-, the FFP produces 80x
more electrons above 100 MeV than the GP, with a cutofl
of 170 MeV compared to 140 MeV for the GP.

The improved uniformity of the channel enhances DLA
by increasing the collimation of the accelerated electrons.
Figure 2 illustrates how the channel uniformity influences
the trajectories and energy gain of representative high-
energy electrons. In all cases, the electrons follow the

path of the channel(s), whether its the multiple channels
formed by the filamenting GP or the single, collimated
channel formed by the FFPs. At the optimal density
for the FFP [n, = 0.08 n,, Fig. 2(c)], the highest-energy
electrons remain collimated and accelerate monotonically
along the entire length of the channel. For visualization
in Fig. 2, the electron density was averaged over snap-
shots taken every 25 fs, using an 8 jzm-long window mov-
ing with the laser pulse (gray scale). The trajectories are
shown for electrons randomly sampled from the most-
energetic population, selected at the time where the en-
ergy spectrum had the largest cutoff (i.e., the right-most
edge of the spectrum).

The FFPs create wide, uniform channels, while fila-
mentation of the GP results in multiple, smaller chan-
nels. The larger width of the channels produced by FFPs
enhance the maximum energy gain achievable through
DLA. The effect of channel width on the maximum en-
ergy gain can be understood using a simple model for
the electron acceleration. Following the approach out-
lined in Ref. [49], and as detailed in the Methods section,
the maximum electron energy supported by a channel
can be estimated as:

driven by a GP. In both cases, the average energy of
he top 10% most energetic electrons (dashed curves) in-
creases monotonically until it approaches the maximum
supported by the channel. For the GP, the acceleration
erminates near x = 0 where the pulse filaments; for the
FFP the acceleration persists along the entire channel.

In addition to the channel width and uniformity, ac-
celeration to high energies requires sustained overlap be-
ween the electrons and the high-intensity region of the
laser pulse. For FFPs, this overlap is governed by the
focal velocity. The optimal focal velocity vy = 1.2c pre-
sented in Figs. 1-3 was identified by performing a simula-
ion scan over vy values ranging from 0.8 — 1.6 c. Figure 4

shows the evolution of the electron energy spectrum (left
column) and overlap between the laser pulse and ener-
getic electrons (right column) for this range, with the
GP results included at the bottom for comparison. The
vy = 1.2c FFP sustains acceleration over the longest du-
ration, leading to the highest electron energies. In all su-
perluminal cases (vf > c), where the propagation is more
stable, a substantial population of electrons with energies
above 100 MeV (pink colorbar) remain coincident with
the transverse electric field of the FFPs (green colorbar),
facilitating continued acceleration. This contrasts with
the subluminal FFP (vs = 0.8c) and GP cases where the
propagation is unstable and there are almost no electrons
above 100 MeV. For fair comparison, each case is shown
for the optimal initial electron density: n. = 0.08 n, for
the FFPs and n, = 0.16 n. for the GP.

Ill. ENHANCED X-RAY EMISSION

The highly collimated, higher-energy electrons gener-
ated by the FFP emit x-rays that exhibit superior colli-
mation and higher energies compared to those produced
y the GP. This is demonstrated by the angle-resolved
hoton spectra presented in Figs. 5 (a) and (b), where
4, is the emission angle in the polarization plane (y-x)
of the pulses. The spectral peak occurs at 27 keV for
he FFP, compared to 10 keV for the GP. The angular
distribution of the radiated energy is shown to the right,
with the dashed lines marking the polar angle. For the
FFP, the emission is more collimated and confined to a
0° cone. Figure 5(c) compares the cumulative energy of
emitted photons above €,. The dashed curve shows the
ratio of cumulative energies for the FFP and GP, demon-
strating a three-fold enhancement in conversion efficiency
for photons above 200 keV with the FFP.

The enhanced x-ray emission with the FFP arises from
he motion of high-energy electrons in the electromag-
netic fields of the laser pulse and quasi-static fields of
he plasma. During DLA, the transverse (i.e., beta-
ron) oscillations of electrons in the combined laser and
lasma fields generate x-rays through two distinct mecha-
nisms [12]. In the first mechanism, the rapid acceleration
within each cycle of the laser pulse generates x-rays that
are emitted in a double-lobed angular structure about
he propagation axis. Observation of this mechanism is
indicative of relatively inefficient electron acceleration,
characterized by frequent cycles of energy gain and loss.
n the second, more efficient mechanism, electrons grad-
ually gain energy over multiple cycles, interact with the
azimuthal magnetic field of the plasma, and emit x-rays
in a single-lobed, collimated angular pattern.

Figure 6 displays the time-integrated energy density of
x-rays generated at each location, revealing the origin of
the enhanced emission. For the GP, the emission peaks
near the center of the channel at « % —25 ym. This
is a hallmark of the inefficient mechanism [12], where
the emission is dominated by the fields of the laser pulse

rather than the quasi-static magnetic field. For the FFP,
the emission peaks at the edges of the channel in lo-
calized islands. Inspection of the quasi-static magnetic
field at a representative time t = 437 fs [Fig. 6(c)] shows
a clear correlation between the emission and island-like
magnetic-field structure. These quasi-periodic magnetic
islands arise from current vortices formed in the wake
of the laser pulse [50, 51]. This structure is consistent
with the efficient x-ray generation mechanism described
above.

IV. DISCUSSION

FFPs feature an arbitrary, tunable velocity intensity
peak, providing an additional degree of freedom for op-
timizing DLA. The 3D PIC simulations presented in
this work demonstrate that a FFP with a superluminal
(vy > c) intensity peak mitigates the nonlinear propaga-
tion effects that otherwise limit the performance of DLA
in high-density plasma. By stabilizing propagation, the
FFP addresses two key requirements for efficient DLA:

ained overlap between the laser pulse and high-energy
electrons.

The wider, more uniform channel and sustained over-
ap enabled by the FFP improve both the collimation
and energy gain of accelerated electrons. Compared to
an optimized GP with the same energy (1 J) and in-
ensity (2 x 10? W/cm?), the FFP produces 80x more
electrons above 100 MeV and raises the cutoff energy
oy 20%. These improvements in the channel structure
and electron dynamics compound to generate x-rays with
higher energies and reduced angular divergence: the FFP
riples the yield of x-rays above 100 keV while simul-
aneously enhancing their collimation. For the optimal
focal velocity (vg = 1.2c) and density (ne = 0.08 ne),
FFP-driven DLA generates approximately 10!° photons
with energy above 1 keV, with a total energy of 14.2 wJ,
corresponding to an IR-to-x-ray conversion efficiency of
~ 10-5. The resulting source brightness is approximately
0?! (s mrad? mm? 0.1%BW)~1, comparable to measure-
ments of DLA-generated x-rays using GPs with 20 times
higher energy [9, 52].
The enhanced stability of high-intensity FFPs demon-
strated here suggests that FFPs may benefit other laser-
lasma applications that rely on the formation of a uni-
form channel, such as ion acceleration in near-critical
density gas targets [53, 54] or self-guiding of relativis-
ically intense laser pulses [55]. Nonlinear propagation
dynamics can also limit electron acceleration, x-ray gen-
eration, and electron-positron pair creation, in relativisti-
cally transparent (ne < aon) or ultra-relativistic regimes
(ao 2 100) [56]. Future work will consider the potential

impact of FFPs in these regimes.

V. METHODS
A. Simulation setup

The advantages of FFPs over conventional GPs were
explored through a series of 3D simulations using the
open-source, fully relativistic PIC code EPOCH [57]. In
all cases, the FFPs and GPs were initialized with the
same energy, pulse duration, and normalized vector po-
tential. This was achieved by making slight adjustments
to the spot size and temporal profile of the pulses. The
pulse parameters are listed in Table I, while the target
and numerical parameters are provided in Table I.

The numerical implementation of FFPs_ follows
Ref. [58]. The transverse electric field is initialized at
a single location in x with a Gaussian profile and a
time-dependent focal length: f(t) = fo + cust/(e — vf),
where vy is the focal velocity. The time-dependent focal
length determines the time-dependent curvature R(t) =
f(t)[1 + Z2/ f2(8)}, spot size w(t) = wll + f2(t)/Z3]?,
and Gouy phase w(t) = tan![f(t)/Zp], where wo is the
spot size at focus and Zp = mw%/Ao is the Rayleigh
range. The initial field is then

E(r,t) = Eo exp (-z5) 2
x exp [-i (-" = tana + 7)) RG);

where Eo is the maximum electric field in vacuum, k =
2n/Xp, w = ck, and T(t) is a temporal profile. For the
simulations presented here T(t) = exp[—(t/7)?4] (see Ta-
ble I).

B. X-ray emission

EPOCH features a Monte-Carlo based module for cal-
culating the synchrotron emission [59], which depends on
the effective transverse field strength:

cation of an electron with velocity v. In the classical

C. Maximum electron energy supported by a DLA
channel

Following Ref. [49], the fields acting on an electron are
separated into the electromagnetic fields of the laser pulse
and the quasi-static fields of the channel. The laser pulse
is approximated as a plane wave with a superluminal
phase velocity vpn that accounts for both the dispersive
properties of the plasma and the finite transverse extent
of the laser beam. The problem then reduces to solving
the relativistic equations of motion under the action of

Cc
E=e,£ycos(€), B= See cos(§)+ Bea, (5)
P!

where e; denotes a unit vector in the direction j. The
channel field B,, is derived from its normalized vector
potential

Here, jo is the longitudinal current density expressed in
terms of the magnetic field gradient through Ampere’s
law.

The fields and particle dynamics depend on a single co-
ordinate € = wo(t—2x/Vpp), which leads to the conserved
integral of motion:

where u = Up,/c is the normalized phase velocity. As
the longitudinal momentum and Lorentz factor y in-
crease, the condition 7 — pz/mec > 0 must hold. Since

FIG. 7. Parameters used to estimate the maximum achiev-
able energy. (a,b) On-axis (y = z = 0) temporal profiles
of the transverse electric field for (a) the GP and (b) the
vg = 1.2c FFP, each at its optimal density: ne = 0.16 n. and
Ne = 0.08 ne, respectively. The black dashed lines show the
segments used to find upp: 1.0215 ¢ for the GP and 1.0119 ¢
for the FFP. (c) The average radius R of the quasi-static mag-
netic field and (d) the parameter a, which is proportional to
the current density, are evaluated at each x-position for both
the GP (black) and the FFP (blue).

1 — px/mec + 0. In this limit, the first term in Eq. 9
can be neglected and the maximum energy gain approx-
imated by p,/mec * Ymax- For the regime of interest,
y/% > (u- 1)7! and ymax can be estimated by combin-
ing the above equations, yielding Eq. 1.

To calculate the maximum supported energy in
Fig. 3 (c), the phase velocity was extracted from the
transverse electric field plotted in Fig. 7. The param-
eters R and a were evaluated at each x-position using
a 20 wm moving average window of the magnetic field
plotted in Fig. 3. The parameter a was obtained from
the slope 0(B.)/Oy, and 2R was defined as the distance
between the minimum and maximum of (B,) along the
y-axis.
