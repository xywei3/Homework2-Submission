Abstract

We construct generalized sets of asymptotic conditions for both three-dimensional Maxwell
Chern-Simons gravity and a novel extension that incorporates torsion through a deformation of
the Maxwell algebra. These boundary conditions include the most general temporal components
of the gauge fields that consistently preserve the corresponding asymptotic Maxwell algebras with
identical classical central charges, while allowing for the inclusion of chemical potentials conjugate
to the conserved charges. We show that both sets of asymptotic configurations admit nontrivial
solutions carrying not only mass and angular momentum but also an additional global spin-2

charge. In the torsionless case, the theory admits locally flat cosmological spacetimes, whereas

in the presence of torsion, it generalizes to BTZ-like black hole geometries. For each case, the

thermodynamic properties are consistently derived in terms of the gauge fields and the topology
of the Euclidean manifold, shown to correspond to a solid torus. Furthermore, we obtain a general
expression for the entropy, depending on both the horizon area and its spin-2 analogues, which can
be written as a reparametrization-invariant integral of the induced spin-2 fields on the spacelike

section of the horizon.

1 Introduction

Three-dimensional gravity provides a fertile setting for exploring conceptual and structural
aspects of gravitational theories. Its topological nature and the absence of local degrees of freedom
simplify the dynamics, allowing for the explicit construction of exact solutions and a detailed
analysis of their physical properties. Notably, when formulated as a Chern-Simons (CS) gauge
theory, gravity in three dimensions provides a natural frame in which symmetries, topology, and
geometry are intrinsically linked [1]. The three-dimensional CS gravity framework constitutes a
powerful theoretical laboratory for exploring various aspect of higher-dimensional gravity theories,
including black hole solutions and their associated thermodynamics properties [2—5].

The inclusion of additional gauge symmetries has proven to be a fruitful avenue for extending

General Relativity (GR). In particular, the formulation of CS (super)gravity theories through
extensions, expansions, and deformations of the Poincaré and AdS symmetries has led to significant
results [6-8]. Within this framework, the Maxwell algebra [9-11], which corresponds to an extension

and deformation of the Poincaré algebra [12], has attracted considerable attention and has been

studied in various contexts [13-33]. Its incorporation into the CS formulation of gravity give rise
to Maxwell CS gravity [8], which is characterized by a new gauge field denoted as the gravitational
Maxwell field. The corresponding field equations derived from the CS action comprise the Poincaré

ones, describing asymptotically flat and torsionless geometries, together with an additional equation

involving the gravitational Maxwell field.
The Maxwell CS gravity theory can alternatively be obtained as a vanishing cosmological
constant limit from two different gravity theories: the so-called AdS-Lorentz gravity [34-36], whose

underlying symmetry corresponds to a semi-simple extension of the Poincaré algebra, and the

Maxwell with torsion [30], which is invariant under the deformed Maxwell algebra first introduced

in [27]. Although both symmetries allow the inclusion of a negative cosmological constant in
the CS actions, the resulting gravity theories are physically distinct. Specifically, Maxwell CS
with torsion can be regarded as a Maxwellian extension of Teleparallel gravity [37-40] when
the deformation parameter is fixed to e« = —2/¢, with ¢ related to the cosmological constant by
A= —z. Notably, under this identification, the cosmological constant effectively acts as a source
of torsion.

In the study of asymptotic symmetries, Maxwell CS gravity has been shown to possess a

modified asymptotic structure, leading to an enlargement of the bms3 algebra [41~43], commonly

denoted as may-bms3 [24]. This extended bms3 algebra can also be recovered as a flat limit of three
copies of the Virasoro algebra [21,36]!, which appears as the asymptotic symmetry algebra of the
AdS-Lorentz CS gravity [36]. Moreover, when torsion is switched on within the Maxwell CS gravity
framework, the asymptotic symmetry algebra undergoes an infinite-dimensional enhancement,
taking the form of bms3 © vit, which can be interpreted as an extended version of the deformed
Maxwell algebra [27].

Despite its algebraic richness and theoretical appeal, the thermodynamic properties of Maxwell
solutions have remained largely unexplored. In this work, we address this gap by analyzing
the entropy and thermodynamic consistency of asymptotically flat cosmological solutions in
three-dimensional Maxwell CS theory. We show that the gravitational Maxwell field contributes a
new global charge and modifies the first law of thermodynamics, providing new insights into the
structure of the theory. In particular, the entropy we obtain extends the standard Bekenstein
Hawking formula of general relativity reported in [44]. We then consider an extension of the
theory by including non-vanishing torsion, achieved via a deformation of the Maxwell algebra
that leads to a new CS theory of gravity with non-Riemannian geometry. As we have said
before, this torsional theory possesses a modified asymptotic symmetry algebra and admits a
novel black hole solution, which we construct explicitly. We compute its conserved charges and
entropy, demonstrating that the solution is a natural generalization of the BTZ-like black hole
with torsion [45-49]. Importantly, we show that the previously discussed cosmological solution
is recovered as the limit ¢ — 0 of this black hole configuration. This limit can be interpreted as
a vanishing cosmological constant limit, i.e. 2 00, when we set ¢ = —2/€. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first explicit construction of a black hole solution with torsion in Maxwell ?,
along with a complete thermodynamic analysis in the torsional and torsionless sectors.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review Maxwell CS gravity and study the
thermodynamics of its asymptotically flat cosmological solutions. Section 3 introduces the torsional
extension and analyzes its asymptotic symmetries and black hole thermodynamics. Section 4

concludes our work with a discussion of our results and future directions.

2 Three-dimensional Maxwell Chern-Simons gravity

In this section, we briefly review the so-called Maxwell CS gravity theory formulated using
the Chern-Simons formalism. We review the asymptotic structure of the theory, whose algebra is
given by an extension and deformation of the bms3 algebra [24], and is denoted here by mar-bms3.
We also address the explicit computation of the entropy for an asymptotically flat cosmological

solution. The Maxwell algebra generated by {Ja,P., Za} is given by the following non-vanishing

commutators:

[Jos Jo] = €aved®, [Jas Py] = €abeP* ,

[Pas Py) = €abeZ” ; [Jas Zo} = Eadbald” « (2.1)
where a, b,--: = 0,1,2 are Lorentz indices raised and lowered with the Minkowski metric ,, and

€abe is the Levi-Civita tensor. In order to write down a CS action for this algebra, we define the
one-form gauge connection
A=uJg+e%Pa +o°Za, (2.2)

where e%,w* and o° correspond to the vielbein, spin connection, and gravitational Maxwell field,
respectively.

The non-vanishing components of the invariant tensor are given by:
(Jao) = Gonad ; (PaPo) = a2Mab 5
(JaPs) = Q11)ab > (JaZp) = A2Nab > (2.3)

where ag, @; and ay are real dimensionless constants. Then, considering the previous invariant

tensor and the one-form gauge connection (2.2) in the CS action

7A} =~ l, (aaa + ay) ; (2.4)

defined on a three-dimensional manifold M, and where k = a is the level of the theory related

to the gravitational constant G, we obtain

k 1
faa = ig. [oo (ween + sonia) + 2a, Rae* + a2 (e°T, + 20°R,) - (2.5)

Here R® = dw% + pe wwe and T* = de® + €*°wyee, are the usual Lorentz curvature and torsion
two-forms. The first term along ao in the action (2.5) is the gravitational CS term. Next term with
coupling constant a, is the Einstein-Hilbert term. The last term, with the strength of interaction
a, gives the dynamics to the gravitational Maxwell field and also contributes to the dynamics of

other fields. Indeed, when ay # 0, the field equations are given by
R*=0,
T*=0, (2.6)

Do®* + 50 “eve = (),
where D®* = db* + €%, ul BE denotes the Lorentz covariant derivative. These field equations
describe geometries which are Riemannian and locally flat, as it can be seen from the above first
two expressions. The third equation shows the dynamics of the gravitational Maxwell field 0%,
referred here somewhat loosely as a “spin-2” field [29]. As it was shown in [24] the coupling of this
one-form field to the geometry leads to nontrivial effects compared to GR that can be regarded as
a deformation [29] of the “exotic” Einstein gravity [51]. In what follows the asymptotic structure
of the three-dimensional Maxwell CS gravity is explored including the thermodynamics features

of locally flat cosmological spacetimes.

2.1 Asymptotic conditions with chemical potentials

Here we review and generalize the set of boundary conditions for Maxwell CS gravity in [24] to
incorporate chemical potentials conjugated to the conserved charges. The study of the behavior
of dynamic fields in the asymptotic region become crucial for computing the thermodynamic
properties configurations with a sensible thermodynamics.

As explained in [52] the radial dependence of the gauge field can be entirely gauged away
asymptotically by virtue of a suitable choice of a gauge group element g = g(r), so that A =

g tag + g~‘dg, where a is an auxiliary connection given by

a = ag (t, d) db + a; (t, d) dt , (2.7)

The asymptotic behavior for ag can be written as follows [24, 53]°

1 1 1
ag = Ji 4 3M Jo aN Po t 37 40; (2.8)

where N,M, and F stand for arbitrary functions of the boundary coordinates (t,¢). The
asymptotic form of ag is preserved under a restricted set of gauge transformations, da = d\+ [a, AJ,

provided that the functions M,N and F transform according to:

JoN = M'f+2Mfl—2f"+N'y+2Ny!', (2.10)

3Hereafter, our conventions are such that the nonvanishing components of the Minkowski metric in tangent space

Nap read Noi = mo = 722 = 1, and the Levi-Civita symbol fulfills e012 = 1.
where y = y(¢,t), f = f(¢,t), and h = h(@,t) are arbitrary functions and prime denotes derivative
with respect to ¢. Following Refs. [54,55], the asymptotic symmetries are preserved under time

evolution by choosing the asymptotic form of the Lagrange multiplier a; according to

a= Aol € v\, (2.11)

with \ defined through (2.9) and where u,€, and v stand for arbitrary functions of the boundary
coordinates (t,¢) which are assumed to be fixed at the boundary. In the thermodynamic analysis
these functions are identified with the “chemical potentials” conjugated to the charges [54]. The
asymptotic form of the temporal components of the connection in (2.11) is maintained by the
asymptotic symmetries provided both that the field equations are fulfilled in the asymptotic region,

1.5

M = 2Myp! + Mp — 2",
N = 2Mé' + M'E+2N pl +N p — 26", (2.12)
F=2Mv! + M'v +2NE + N'E + 2F yl + Fl — 2",

and that parameters y,€, and v, which describe the asymptotic symmetries, satisfy suitable

differential equations of first order in time given by

gay py €=fil—pfi +yl—&y',
v=hp'—-h'p+ fe —fiety'-yv. (2.13)

The asymptotic symmetry generators can be computed in the Regge-Teitelboim approach [56,57]

such that their variations reduce to

k
QL] = a (dda) do, (2.14)

where OD stands for the boundary of the spacelike section U. The explicit form of the generators

associated to the asymptotic symmetries can be integrated and are found to be given by

Qly, fh] =- fe (yJ + fP+hZ), (2.15)

where the dynamical fields 7, P and Z are determined in terms of the functions V, M, and F,

according to the relations:

f= & (a29F ta;N+aoM) ; P= ft (aNt+aM) ; Z= Ls a2M . (2.16)

The algebra of the conserved charges (2.15) can be readily obtained from the transformation law of

the dynamical fields in (2.17) by virtue of 5),Q[A1] = {Q[A1], Q[A2]}. Thus, expanding in Fourier

modes according to X = x > Xme'”?, and providing that the zero modes Xo being shifted as
Xo > Xo + $4, the nontrivial Poisson brackets are given by [24,53]
i{Im, In} = (m— 17) Imin + 67 m(m? 1)dm+n0 5
i{IJms Pn} = (m—n) Pmin + ep m(m? — 1)6 ovis
i{Im, Zn} = (m—1n) Zmin + cz m(m? 1)dm-+n.0 + (2.18)
t{Pm, Pn} = (m—N) Zmin + cz m(m? 1) 6maeni0 +

where the central extensions c7, cp and cz are fully determined in terms of the constants of the

action (2.5) according to
cz = kao cp =ka1, cz =kag. (2.19)

It is worth noting that this asymptotic symmetry algebra corresponds to an extension and
deformation of bms3 algebra [41-43] at which both the abelian generators Z, and the generators
P,, have conformal weight 2. This deformation introduces an additional central extension cz which
is proportional to the coupling constant of the Maxwell gravitational action. It also is reassuring
that the asymptotic symmetry algebra (2.18) contains the wedge algebra in (2.1) for generators
Xm, with m = —1,0,1, providing i{, } > [,].

It should be noted that gauge field configurations with M, N, F, as well as the chemical
potentials €, 1, v fixed to constants, solve the field equations in (2.12). Indeed, this class of

configurations explicitly reads

5 (eM + pN) Po +€Pi + = 5M + pF +EN) Zo + v2] dt, (2.20)

In appendix A by restoring the radial dependence of the gauge fields, it shown that this stationary
solution describes a locally flat cosmological spacetime endowed with a spin-2 gauge field, named
here as the Maxwell CS field. It also follows from (2.15) that this solution not only possesses
mass and angular momentum, being parametrized by the spin-2 charges P, 7, respectively, but
also has an extra global charge of spin 2, determined by Z. In the next section thermodynamic

properties of this solution is analyzed.
2.2 Thermodynamics of asymptotically flat cosmological solutions

This section is devoted to the study of the thermodynamics of cosmological solutions in the
Maxwell CS gravity theory. In this context, following the canonical approach the entropy can be

suitably computed along the lines of [55,58], by the general formula

k
Ss=— L/ drdo(A,A )|
2m Ln. ° on-shell

=k [(a744)]on-shell , (2.21)

where A, stands for the Euclidean continuation of A; by the replacement 7 = it and where its
final form is obtained in terms of the on-shell holonomies which is then continued to Lorentzian.

For the field configuration in (2.20) the entropy reads

S=klaowM + a1 (uN +€M) + 02(UM+ EN + UF)] , (2.22)

where it is assumed that the chemical potentials (€,.,) are constrained to fulfill regularity
conditions. Since all the chemical potentials are explicitly incorporated along the temporal
components of the gauge fields, the analysis can be carried out for a fixed range of the angular
coordinates of the torus, i.e., we assume that 0 <7 <1, and 0 < ¢< 27. Thus, these regularities
conditions, can be computed following the prescription in [58] which, in our case consists in
finding a permissible gauge transformation that allows to gauge away the temporal components
of the dreibein and the gravitational Maxwell field, i.e, e, = 0; = 0. The latter implies that a,
reduces such that it only takes values in the Lorentz subalgebra of the gauge group spanned by

the Maxwell algebra (2.1), so that the remaining regularity condition results in requiring that the

holonomy along the thermal circle to be trivial.

In the present case, the required group element reads

g = hPateta (2.23)

so that the angular and temporal components of the gauge field now read

where nm is an integer. It is important to note that, since we are dealing with a cosmological

he chemical potential € is such that € = —1/Tc. This choice is consistent with the requirement
hat the Hawking temperature be positive, fixing nm to be positive or negative, depending on the
sign of the function NV.
In summary, the regularity conditions of the Euclidean gauge fields are successfully implemented,
eading to the chemical potentials being fixed as specific functions of the global charges, according
o (2.16), as follows
mT N 2T a [ F 3N?

It is reassuring that for nm = sgn(V) the above result for the regularity conditions is in complete

é= (2.30)

agreement with those found in the metric formalism, which stem from requiring the absence of
conical singularities of the Euclidean fields at the cosmological horizon, as it is shown in (A.19).
The entropy can then be readily obtained by plugging the chemical potentials (2.30) in
eq.(2.22), so in terms of the variables M, NV and F, it reads
N ag Ff N 2
S = 27nmk jaoVM +a + . 2.31

This result for the entropy not only extends the one for General Relativity (along a1) [44,58,59] in

the presence of the CS term (ao 4 0) [60,61], but also points out an explicit contribution (along
a2) of the gravitational Maxwell field to the entropy of the cosmological spacetimes in this gravity
theory.

In terms of the (extensive) global charges 7,P and Z defined through eqs. (2.16), the entropy

in (2.31) can be rewritten as follows

as Bes J. % 1/P a)?

In order to have a sensible thermodynamics, the entropy must be a real function, therefore Z > 0
as well as the coupling constants a; > 0 with i = 0,1, 2. In addition, positivity of the entropy
implies that the angular momentum has to be such that for nm > 0 then J > J, and for nm < 0

then J < Je, where*

Thus, in order to determine the temperature and the chemical potentials in the microcanonical

where M = 27?P, J = —2707, and W = 27Z, such that the first law of thermodynamics is found
to fulfilled according to
bSc = Bc(OM — QedJ — cd6W) , (2.37)

such that the chemical potentials 6g = €, Ac = /E€, and ®g = —v/€ correspond to the conjugated
to the mass, angular momentum and the additional spin-2 charge, respectively.

As a final remark of this section, note that the entropy depends not only on the horizon area
but also on the values of the spin connection and the gravitational Maxwell fields at the horizon
(see appendix A). Actually, one verifies that the values of the purely angular components of the

spin-2 fields at the cosmological horizon are given by

From this one concludes that the entropy (2.31) can be fully expressed as the sum of the horizon
area element and its spin-2 analogues, thereby extending the standard Bekenstein-Hawking formula

for the entropy in our case to the form
S=k(aoAcs + a1Ametric + 02AMax) ; (2.41)

As depicted in appendix A, these particular contributions in (2.39) appear naturally defined
in terms of the pullback of the metric and the spin-2 fields at the spacelike section of the

horizon [62,63].

“In the metric formulation nm appears determined in terms the global charges according to nm = sgn(a2P —a1Z).
In the following section, we will deal with the Maxwell generalization of three-dimensional
gravity with torsion. We first present the CS gravity theory invariant under a deformed Maxwell
algebra. Subsequently, we will compute the asymptotic symmetry algebra considering consistent
boundary conditions that incorporate chemical potentials, and finally we analyze the black hole
solution of the theory including its corresponding thermodynamics features. We will show that

the results obtained in this section can be recovered in the torsionless limit in a particular case.

3  Three-dimensional Maxwell Chern-Simons gravity with torsion

In this section, we present a generalization of Maxwell CS gravity by including torsion. For
this purpose, we will consider a particular deformation of the Maxwell algebra, which was first
presented in [27], and subsequently approached in [30]. Interestingly, despite the deformed Maxwell
symmetry is isomorphic to the direct sum of iso(2,1) with so0(2,1), the resulting CS action leads

to a non-vanishing torsion as equation of motion [30].

3.1 Maxwell Chern-Simons gravity with torsion

The deformed Maxwell algebra is spanned by the set of generators {Ja, Pa, Za}, which satisfy

the following non-vanishing commutation relations:

[Ja, Jo] = €abI®, [Ja, Ps] = €apeP*,

[Ja, Zo] = €abeZ*, [Pa, Po) = €ade (Z° + €P*) « (3.1)
Note that when the deformation parameter ¢ is fixed to zero, the Maxwell algebra in (2.1) is
recovered. In fact, the algebra (3.1) can be seen as the Maxwell extension of the teleparallel

algebra [40]. As was pointed out in [27], the previous algebra can be written as the direct sum of

the iso(2,1) and s0(2,1) algebras. Indeed, considering the following redefinition of the generators,
bg=Ii— ee" Pp-e Ry, 5 Thee » Sy Ser Py be PF Za, (3.2)
the iso(2, 1) ® so(2, 1) algebra is revealed,
[La, Lo] = €ateL® ,
[La Ts] = €abeT® , (3.3)
[Sa, Sb] = €abeS®.

Three-dimensional gravity action based on the deformed Maxwell algebra (3.1) can be formulated

as a CS form by considering (2.4), and where the gauge connection one-form A reads
A=e9P, +w*Jg+0°Za, (3.4)

where e*, w® and o® are the dreibein, the spin connection, and the gravitational Maxwell field,

respectively. The corresponding curvature two-form F = dA + s[A, A] is given by

F=T*P,+ R°Ja+ F*Za, (5)

R* = dw* + Be WbWe

F*% = Do*+ xO ebee .

Here, T° = De® is the torsion two-form, R® is the curvature two-form, and D is the Lorentz
covariant derivative defined above. Note that the limit « — 0 reproduces, as expected, the Maxwell
curvature two-form in (2.6).

On the other hand, the non-vanishing components of an invariant bilinear form of the deformed

Maxwell algebra read

(JaJvo) = aonab; (Pa Py) = (€04 + a2) Nad » 3.7)

(JaPs) = aad ; (JaZp) = 2Nab ;

where ao, @1 and ag are arbitrary constants. Naturally, the limit « + 0 applied to (3.7) leads to
the non-vanishing components of the invariant tensor for the Maxwell algebra (2.3).
From the gauge potential (3.4) and the non-vanishing components of the invariant tensor (3.7),

the Chern-Simons action (2.4) reduces to the torsional Maxwell CS action

1 1 2
Ttor—mar = —— | ag ( w%dwg + =e wawywe ) +a ( 2Rae* + E etbe Cree + eT ey

up to a surface term. One can see that the CS action is proportional to three independent sectors,
each one with its respective coupling constant. In particular, the first two terms along ag and a,
correspond to those of the Riemann-Cartan gravity, namely gravity with non-vanishing torsion.
The piece along the ag contains a torsional term, a cosmological term and a term involving the
gravitational Maxwell field oa.

Varying the action (3.8) with respect to the fundamental fields yields the field equations of

Maxwell CS with torsion,

be": 0O=a, (Ra + fa) + aT, ;
bu": 0 =a0Ra t+ ait + 02Fa, (3.9)

Imposing the conditions ag 4 0 and ag 4 —ea to avoid degeneracy, the previous equations reduce

to the vanishing of the curvature two-forms (3.6),

As we can see, the field equations are those of Riemann-Cartan gravity (with zero curvature and
constant torsion) plus the equation of motion involving the gravitational Maxwell field. Then, the
geometries described by the equations (3.10) are non-Riemannian (with non-vanishing torsion)
and locally flat. As expected, when ¢ — 0, the above equations reduce to the field equations
for the Maxwell CS gravity theory (2.6). Furthermore, note that the spin connection w* can be
decomposed as

where w* corresponds to the torsion-free Levi-Civita connection, and k® is the contorsion. By the

second equation in (3.10), the contorsion is fixed as follows

€

Then, the equation of motion of the gravitational Maxwell field and the Riemann-Cartan curvature

where the effective cosmological constant is

het =—- (3.14)

When the effective cosmological constant is negative, Aeg = -@: the metric is given by the anti-de
Sitter solution since Agg < 0. Indeed, in this case, the solution of the first two equations in (3.10)
is given by the so-called Riemman-Cartan black hole [45]. In particular, for ¢ = —2/, this solution
leads to the teleparallel black hole [38, 46].

Note that each term of the action (3.8) is invariant under the gauge transformation laws of

the algebra (3.1). Indeed, considering the following gauge parameter
A= e°P, + p*Ja + x°Za, (3.15)
we have that the gauge transformations 6A = dA + [A, A] of the theory are given by

In the next section, we shall demonstrate that three-dimensional Maxwell gravity with torsion
admits black hole solutions. We show that the aforementioned solution constitutes a generalization
of the teleparallel black hole presented in [37,38, 45,64], whose thermodynamic properties are
directly influenced by the presence of the gravitational Maxwell field o*. Prior to this analysis,

we will present a detailed study of the asymptotic structure of the previously discussed theory of

gravity with torsion.

3.2 Asymptotic symmetries

The asymptotic conditions for Maxwell CS gravity theory with non-vanishing torsion were
explored in [30]. Here we generalized this analysis to incorporate chemical potentials conjugated
to the conserved charges and for a generic deformation parameter ¢. Thus, along the line of [52]
the radial dependence of the gauge field is eliminated asymptotically for an appropriate gauge
choice, so that

A=g'ldgtg'aeg, (3.17)

with a(.) = a;(t, d)dt + ag(t,d)d@. In this case, the form of ag is chosen to be given by (2.8) [30].
It is found then that the asymptotic form of angular component ag is left invariant for the

Lie-algebra-valued parameter A(-) = (-)[y, f, h] given by
Bi pone
Ae) = AC) + aN FPo j (3.18)
and providing that the functions M,N and ¥ now transform according to:

5(e)M = 60M ,
d(eV = SyV te(N'f+2NP') , (3.19)

where Ao) and 6(9)(-) are specified by (2.9) and (2.10), respectively. Thus, to preserve the
asymptotic symmetries under evolution in time, the asymptotic form of the Lagrange multiplier
a; must to be of the form

a= ols), (3.20)

where the arbitrary functions p(t, ¢), €(t,¢@) and v(t, d) are identified with the chemical potentials
conjugated to the charges and which are assumed to be fixed at the boundary [54,55]. The
asymptotic behavior of a; is then preserved under the asymptotic symmetries considering that the

field equations:
M = 2Mypl + M' pw — 2",

N =2Mé + M'E+2N yl +N" — 26" +e (NEF 2QNE) , (3.21)
Fe = 2M! + M'v + 2NE + NE + 2F pl + F'p— Qu",

are satisfied in the asymptotic region and the parameters y, f, and h fulfill the following conditions:

gay —w! s €=fi —uf tye —by +e (fe - Ef) ,
v=hp'—h'p+ fe — fiet+y'—-yv. (3.22)

The asymptotic symmetry generators are then obtained through the Regge-Teitelboim method [56]

through the expression in (2.14) considering the invariant tensor in (3.7), the angular component

13
of gauge field ag in (2.8), and the algebra-valued parameter defined in (3.18). Thus, one finds that

6Qly, f,h| = - fe (yOT + fOP +hdZ), (3.23)

where the canonical generators of the asymptotic symmetry are found to be determined by

k k k
J =—(aF+taN+aoM) ; P=— [(ecartax)N+aiM] ; Z=—a2M. (3.24)
An An An

The corresponding transformations laws of these latter canonical generators can be obtained using

(3.19), leading to

Under the assumption that the functions y, f, and h exhibit no field dependence, the integration

of the variation (3.23) becomes trivial, resulting in

Qlu. fit] =~ f dour + $P + hZ). (3.26)

As in the case without torsion, expanding in Fourier modes according to _X = + Soin A one
¢ 2a Sam *™ ,

finds that 7, P and Z obey, in terms of the Poisson bracket, the following asymptotic symmetry

algebra
{Im In} = (m—=N) Imtn tog m(m? = 1)bminos
i{Im,Pn} = (m— 1) Pmin + cp m(m? 1)dm+n0;

i A Tons Bayh (m n) Zm4n CZ m(m? 1)dm+n0 ,

where classical central charges cz7,cp and cz are defined in (2.19). The infinite-dimensional
algebra (3.27) can be seen as an infinite-dimensional enhancement of the deformed Maxwell
algebra (3.1) in which both the abelian generators Z, and the generators P,, have conformal
weight 2. In particular, in the limit ¢ > 0 we recover the asymptotic symmetry algebra in (2.18)
of the three-dimensional Maxwell CS gravity theory reviewed in Section (2.1). Furthermore, as it
was shown in [30] the algebra (3.27) is isomorphic to the bms3 @ vit algebra.

In this context, it is important to highlight those gauge field configurations with M, N, F,

and also the chemical potentials €, 4, v fixed to constants, since these fulfill the field equations in

(3.21). The gauge field for this class of configurations a(-) = a,dt + agdé, explicitly reads

In appendix B by restoring the radial dependence of the gauge field (3.28) is shown that this
stationary solution corresponds to the BTZ black hole [3] together to a spin-2 gauge field, named
here as the gravitational Maxwell field. Generically, as follows from (3.26) this solution not only
possesses mass and angular momentum, parametrized by the spin-2 charges P, 7, respectively,
but also possesses an extra global charge of spin 2, determined by Z. In what follows, we will
carry out the calculation and analysis of the entropy associated with the black hole solution
(3.28) for Maxwell CS gravity with torsion, as well as examine the corresponding first law of

thermodynamics.

3.3. Thermodynamics

Let us move now to the study of the thermodynamics of the solution (3.28) of the Maxwell
CS theory with torsion. As in the Maxwell case, the entropy can be determined from the
expression (2.21). Hence, plugging (3.28) into the expression for the entropy (2.21), and using the

non-vanishing components of the invariant tensor (3.7), one finds
S =k [aoyM + ay (uN +€M + EN) + a2 (UM + EN + pF )lon-shent > (3.29)

where it is assumed that the regularity conditions are imposed.

As in the Maxwell case, and along the lines of [58], we have to find an permissible gauge
transformation allowing to gauge away some temporal components of the gauge field so that it
takes values only in the Lorentz subalgebras of the gauge group (3.1). In this case, for simplicity
and exploiting the fact that the deformed Maxwell algebra can be expressed as the direct sum of

the Poincaré and Lorentz algebras (see (3.2)), we consider the following group element
g=e™, (3.30)

so that the angular and temporal components of (3.28), take the form,

1 1 1
ag I1 + $1 + pTi + SMLo + 5 (eF pM N)To + 5(M +N) 50,
1 1
a = ply 4 gh MLo + (pL e8)S1 + 5(M + EN) (H+ €€)S0 + (pu — § + ev) Th
+ (euF — uN — M(p+€—ev)) To. (3.31)

It is thus found that the term along 7; in a; vanishes when p is given by

p= §—ev , (3.32)
be
and that the term along 7p is eliminated by fixing the Lagrange multiplier v according to
€ (eF-N)

€ MN (88)

15
so that the temporal component a, reduces to

a = Ul G + 5M) + (4 + €€) [s+ $M + en) 5] a (3.34)

Thus, imposing that the holonomy of the a; around the thermal circle is trivial, which in this

case is written as

the chemical potentials €, 41, v become fixed as specific functions of M,N and F, obtaining the

following results:

b= VM’
20 n m
«F Ga- yee) 30

2rn E i ( ~)) 2am

VM |e2 2M € e2/M+eN’
where n,m are integers. Note that in the present case, as we are dealing with a black hole solution,
the orientation of the solid torus is reversed relative to that of the cosmological solution analyzed
in the section (2.2). Furthermore, it is shown in appendix (B) that for n = —m = 1, the regularity
conditions in (3.36) are in complete agreement with those found in the metric formalism in (B.19)
that stem from requiring the absence of conical singularities of the Euclidean fields at the event
horizon. This means that in the present case € = 1/Tgy, with Tgp the Hawking temperature.

Thus, substituting (3.36) into the entropy (3.29), one obtains

Spu = ania | (SS =) (» bmy/1-4 =) n [20 + os (=) ; (3.37)

It can be readily checked that, upon imposing the condition m = n = —n, the expression

reduces to (2.31) in the limit ¢ > 0. In terms of the global charges P, J y Z, the entropy finally

reads
Sou AnVtk,/ag [n (P-—eF sry 1 ay — EQ vz m /dag+ £1 Zep ;

(3.38)
The entropy Spy is real for conditions ag > 0, ag + ca, > 0, Z >0 and Z+¢eP >0. Moreover,

for e < 0, we can see that this quantity is positive for the additional conditions:
e When m=n, forn>0, J > % and forn <0, J < J, with

where M = 27P, J = —277, and W = 27Z. These thermodynamical quantities satisfy the first
law of thermodynamics.

6Spu = pr (OM — Qpndd — PpydW), (3.44)

such that the chemical potentials 8gy = €, OpH = p/f€, and ®gy = —v/E correspond to the
conjugated to the mass, angular momentum and the additional spin-2 charge, respectively. To
recover the results of the Maxwell theory without torsion in the limit e > 0, it is necessary to
impose the condition m = n. As a remark, in the present case we have € = 1/Tgy, whereas in
the cosmological solution of Maxwell CS, the corresponding relation is € = —1/Ty. As we have
mentioned, with the choice m = n = —nm, it is straightforward to show that the limit « > 0
applied to the black hole entropy (3.38) leads to the entropy of the cosmological solution of the
Maxwell CS theory (2.32).

It must be emphasized that we can express the black hole entropy (3.38) in terms of the outer

and inner horizons of the black hole defined in (B.9) as follows

omen a0 a(r2, — 2b)0
Sinn 2nk ( i (ry —r_) — onr_ a ) ; (3.45)
a 2
Sout = 2ntk (F (rp —r_) tarry oo) ; (3.46)
where we have fixed « = —2/¢. We conclude that Sout corresponds to a Maxwell extension (along

az) of the entropy of the teleparallel black hole extensively analyzed in [45-48], and recently

studied in [65]. The first law in this case takes the form
6M = Tpy Sout + 2y5] + BOW (3.47)

where the extensive variables can be expressed as follows

rer? lor (rf + 2b(1 + r_/r4) — 38ryr_) é

a4 4
Ten Innler,’ On £0 bry? a 4(r_—r_)? (348)

17
As we have already mentioned, it is not possible to take the flat limit € > 00 in Sout since
r4(M, J,£) is pushed out to infinity and consequently does not have a well-defined limit. We can
consider instead the thermodynamics of the inner horizon of the Maxwell BTZ-like black hole

with torsion as follows,

rer 1 r. r+ 2b(1 + r4/r_) — 3r4r_) L
Ton = ——— Qin = + inn = A
with a first law of the form
OM = —Tinnd Sinn + Qinn dd + Oinn dW - (3.50)

The thermodynamics of the inner (Cauchy) horizon of black holes has been studied in [66,67]. As

happens in the standard BTZ black hole, the horizon of the cosmological solution in the Maxwell

case, corresponds to the limit of the inner horizon of the Maxwell BTZ-like black holes with
torsion. Furthermore, as we have mentioned before all thermodynamic quantities of the Maxwell
cosmological solutions are recovered in the flat limit @ — oo of the quantities of the inner horizon
of the Maxwell torsional BTZ-like black hole (when m = n).

It is also important to point out that in the metric formalism (n = —m = 1) the entropy

in (3.37) can be also fully expressed as the sum of the horizon area element and its spin-2
analogues [62,63] leading to an extended version of the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy
formula given by

Spu = k (aoAcs + a1Ametric + @2AMax) ; (3.51)

where Acs, Amax and Ametric are related to the values of the purely angular components of the

spin-2 fields at the event horizon:

where these particular contributions in (3.52) are defined in terms of the pullback of the metric

and the spin-2 fields at the spacelike section of the horizon defined in (A.21) (see Refs. [62,63]).

4 Discussion

In this work, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the thermodynamics of three-
dimensional gravity solutions based on Maxwell symmetry, considering both cases with and

without torsion. As mentioned in the Introduction, despite the algebraic richness and theoretical

relevance of Maxwell CS gravity, the thermodynamic behavior of its solutions had not been thor-

oughly investigated. In this article, we contributed to closing this gap by examining the entropy

18
and establishing the thermodynamic consistency of asymptotically flat cosmological solutions and
black holes in three-dimensional Maxwell Chern-Simons.

We first examined the behavior of the dynamical fields in the asymptotic region, which was
essential for computing the thermodynamic properties of the solutions. In both scenarios, we
considered asymptotic conditions incorporating chemical potentials conjugate to the conserved
charges. In the case without torsion, we found that the entropy of the cosmological solution
extends the one for General Relativity in the presence of the CS term, and has a new contribution
proportional to the a2 constant, showing that the gravitational Maxwell field modifies not only

the conserved charges but also the entropy of the solution.

We then extended the analysis to the thermodynamics of the Maxwell BTZ-like black hole
with torsion, and we found that the entropy generalizes the one of the torsional BTZ black hole,
exhaustively studied in [45-48]. By evaluating the entropy through the first law, we verified that
the resulting expressions consistently satisfy black hole thermodynamics in both torsional and
torsionless theories. In the appropriate limit, the charges and entropy of the Maxwell BTZ-like
black hole with torsion reduce smoothly to the results of Maxwell CS without torsion, which

confirms the robustness of our formulation. Taken together, these results establish a coherent

thermodynamic framework for Maxwell CS gravity theories, clarifying how torsion affects the
structure of conserved charges and the interpretation of physical parameters in stationary black hole
solutions. It would be interesting to extend our study and the asymptotic symmetry analysis to the
non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic regimes of the Maxwell CS gravity theory [68]. Of particular
interest is the emergence of an infinite-dimensional extension of the generalized Maxwell algebra

as the asymptotic symmetry algebra of the AdS-Carroll CS gravity [69]. One could investigate

he boundary dynamics of Maxwellian generalizations of the Galilean/Carroll (super)gravity
introduced in [68, 70-76], together with the space of solutions satisfying the set of asymptotic
conditions. Furthermore, it would be natural to consider alternative boundary conditions in order
o explore their impact on both the asymptotic symmetry algebra and the solution space.

On the other hand, the presence of non-vanishing torsion in a non-relativistic regime has also

been shown to be particularly interesting. In fact, non-vanishing torsion in such a setting was

first encountered in the context of Lifshitz holography [77] and the Quantum Hall Effect [78].
Subsequently, diverse strategies have been implemented to construct non-relativistic gravity
models with non-vanishing torsion [79-83]. Thus, it would be worthwhile to explore the boundary
dynamics of torsional non-relativistic gravity models.

It should also be emphasized that the study presented in this article provides the missing
elements necessary to carry out a complete analysis of the energy bounds and asymptotic Killing
spinors in the supersymmetric extensions of both Maxwell/Hietarinta and AdS—Lorentz gravity
theories [25,53, 84].

A Chemical Potentials in the Metric Formalism (Torsionless Case)

In order to recovered the spacetime metric g,,, as well as the gravitational Maxwell field o,,,
the radial dependence in the gauge field (2.20) must be introduced through a permissible gauge

Note that the chemical potentials €, 4 and v have been explicitly incorporated in the metric gy,

horizon at r = r, can be carried out for a fixed range of the angular coordinates of the solid torus,
where it is assumed to be 0 < 7 < 1, and 0 < ¢ < 2r. It is follows that around the cosmological

horizon the rotating frame in (A.7) can be fixing by choosing the Lagrange multiplier jz according

It is worth pointing out that both the metric and the gravitational Maxwell field are finite
and well-behaved at the horizon. Indeed, around the horizon both the metric (A.12) and the
gravitational Maxwell field (A.14) by virtue of the regularity conditions (A.11) and (A.16) reduce
to Rindler spacetimes with the same Hawking temperature which becomes fixed to € = —1/To,
where the minus sign amounts to the fact that orientation of the solid torus is reversed compared
to that of the black hole; so that the chemical potential € corresponds to the minus branch of
(A.13).
Thus, in the metric formalism the regularity conditions on the fields are found to be given by

B Chemical Potentials in the Metric Formalism with Torsion

For the Maxwell CS theory with torsion (3.8) the corresponding spacetime metric g,,, as well
as the gravitational Maxwell field o,,, are constructed through the restoring the radial dependence
in the full gauge field. For the solution in (3.28) the latter can be carried out by the following

group element

98 = cP (r)P2t+G(r) Za , (B.1)
with F(r) and G(r) given by

Thus, the components of the full gauge field,

are suitably written as follows
Ag=agteg(r) ; Ap=aztea(r) ; Ap=e,(r), (B.5

The spacetime metric ds? = naves.e dat dx” , is then found to be given by
ds? = —f(r)2€2dt2 + aw (ao + N*(r)dt) (B.7)

where f(r) is given by (B.3) while N®(r) reads

It is reassuring that this solution corresponds to the three-dimensional black hole solution [2],

which goes hand in hand with the field equations in (3.13). It also follows from (B.3) that for

23
M > 0 this spacetime develops an inner and an event horizon which located at r = rz, being

determined according to

The regularity of the fields around the event horizon r = r, can be carried out for a fixed range

of the angular coordinates of the solid torus, i.e., 0 <7 <1, and 0 < ¢< 27. The latter can be

implemented by the fixing of the rotating frame around r+ in the metric (B.7) which leads to

( ~) é, (B.13)

so that around the event horizon r, the metric behaves as follows ©

choosing the Lagrange multiplier j1, according to

from which one can read that the Hawking temperature € = 1/Tgy is found to be

Along the same line, expanding the Maxwell field (B.10) around r, with the previous fixing (B.13),

it acquires the behavior

Thus, by fixing the rotating frame in the gravitational Maxwell field around r, introduces the

It should be emphasized that both the metric and the gravitational Maxwell field are finite and
well-behaved at the horizon r,. Furthermore, around the horizon both the metric (B.14) and the
gravitational Maxwell field (B.16) by virtue of the regularity conditions (B.13) and (B.18) reduce
to Rindler spacetimes with the same Hawking temperature determined in (B.15).

In sum, in the metric formalism the regularity conditions on the fields are found to be given by
