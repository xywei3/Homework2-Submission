Abstract

We study finite-field extensions that preserve the same support as the parity-check matrices defining a given binary
CSS code. Here, an LDPC-CSS code refers to a CSS code whose parity-check matrices are orthogonal in the sense
that each pair of corresponding rows overlaps in an even (possibly zero) number of positions, typically at most twice
in sparse constructions. Beyond the low-density setting, we further propose a systematic construction method that
extends to arbitrary CSS codes, providing feasible finite-field generalizations that maintain both the binary support
and the orthogonality condition.

I. INTRODUCTION

In this paper, we address the problem of extending a binary CSS code to a finite-field representation while preserving
its structural properties. Given a pair of binary parity-check matrices whose corresponding rows overlap in an even
number of positions, we seek to construct non-binary matrices over a finite field that share the same pattern of nonzero
entries and remain orthogonal. Although this task can be viewed as a multivariate quadratic feasibility problem over
a finite field, it is generally hard to solve due to the nonlinear nature of the constraints and the exponential size of the
solution space.

The method originally proposed in [1] transforms a pair of orthogonal binary matrices into non-binary matrices
over a finite field while keeping the same support pattern. This technique was first developed for quasi-cyclic LDPC
codes [2] with column weight two, later applied to toric codes [3], and subsequently generalized to protograph-based
constructions [4]. The resulting non-binary CSS codes, as demonstrated in recent works [4], [5], achieved decoding
performance close to the hashing bound when joint belief propagation was used.

However, these previous approaches were limited to cases where each column contains exactly two ones. Extending
the construction to more general CSS codes—where column weights may vary across different rows and matrices—
remains a challenging problem. In such settings, one must simultaneously preserve the binary support and maintain the
orthogonality between the two parity-check matrices, while also avoiding short cycles and ensuring sufficient flexibility
in assigning non-binary coefficients.

Although orthogonality can be trivially maintained by assigning constant coefficients to each column or by setting all
nonzero entries to one, such simple constructions tend to degrade important code properties such as minimum distance
and error-floor performance. Our goal, therefore, is to characterize the entire space of feasible finite-field extensions so
that one can systematically or randomly generate valid non-binary instances with diverse coefficient configurations.

To achieve this, we parameterize the non-binary entries using multiplicative representations over the finite field
and translate the orthogonality constraints into a sparse system of linear congruences among integer exponents. This
system can be efficiently solved either in canonical form using Smith normal decomposition or through a lightweight
elimination process involving only integer additions and row swaps. Once a feasible set of exponents is obtained, the
corresponding non-binary matrices are recovered by standard linear algebra over the finite field.

As a simple baseline, we introduce a separable assignment of coefficients that always guarantees orthogonality for
any even-overlap pattern.

II. PROBLEM SETTING
This section formulates the finite-field extension problem for arbitrary CSS codes. Let (H¢,Hp) be a binary
orthogonal pair with Hc € {0,1}“**% and Hp € {0,1}“2*%. Write the entries of Hc and Hp as ¢j,; and dij,
respectively. They satisfy the binary orthogonality condition
HoH} = 0,
which is equivalent to

All arithmetic in (1) is over Fo.
Our goal is to construct matrices Hp = (9j,;) € Een’ and Hy = (di) € RilzxN such that
HrH\ =0, — supp(Hr) =supp(Hc), — supp(Ha) = supp(Hp).
Equivalently, the support constraints enforce
%q > 0 if Gy = 0, 6g = 0 iT dry —0,
so in particular ¢;,; =1> yi,3 € Fy and dy. p= 1 => dug € ES.
The orthogonality over F, is then

All arithmetic in (2) is over Fy.
The unknowns are the entries {7,5 : ¢,; = 1} U {dij : dv; = 1}. The constraints (2) yield Mx Mz homogeneous
quadratic equations in these variables over Fy. Thus, finding a feasible assignment is an instance of the multivariate
quadratic (MQ) feasibility problem, which is NP-complete [6].

III. FINITE-FIELD EXTENSION FOR LDPC-CSS CobEs

The binary orthogonality condition (1) implies that every row pair (i,7’) has an even number of common nonzero
columns. Let $j, {0,1,..., N — 1} denote the set of column indices where both ci,j = 1 and dy; = 1; that is,

Sez def {j|¢,j =land dy; =1}.

By construction, |Sj,;/| is always even.

We focus on the canonical case in which each row pair shares either 0 or 2 columns. This covers many practical
CSS constructions (e.g., quasi-cyclic and protograph-based designs) and arises frequently in sparse instances, where
pairwise overlaps beyond two are unlikely.

Assume Hc Hf, = 0, fix q = 2™, and let a € Fy be a primitive element. Let Hp = (11,5) and Ha = (6,3) preserve
the binary support: each zero in (Hc, Hp) remains zero, and each nonzero entry is replaced by an element of Fy... We
parameterize the nonzero entries multiplicatively as

Vig =O, yj = a,

,) shares exactly two columns j and j’, the orthogonality condition )> : i,39:",7 = 0 over Fy reduces
gig + Yi5/5i,y1 = 0.

Since char(F,) = 2, we havex+y=0 <— > x=y. Hence

"Vig Oi = i, 5:5" es Qt Cig Hh fit = 1,

and therefore
i,j — Cig + firg — Frgr =O (mod g—-1).

Collecting these relations over all row pairs (i, 7’) with |S;,;/| = 2 produces a sparse system of linear congruences:

Av=0 (mod q-1), (3)

where v stacks the unknown exponents {ej : cij = 1}U {firy : diy = 1}. The coefficient matrix A € {0,+1}"™"
has one row for each overlapping pair (i, 7’ ) and one column for each nonzero entry of Ho or Hp. Equation (3)
compactly captures all additive consistency constraints among the exponents.

A. Solving the Linear Congruence System

For a modulus n = q— 1 > 0 and an integer matrix A, the homogeneous system Av = 0 (mod n) can be analyzed
via the Smith normal form (SNF) of A over Z [7], which provides a canonical decomposition of the solution space.
When gq — 1 is prime (that is, when 2” — 1 is a Mersenne prime), the ring Z/(q — 1)Z forms a finite field isomorphic

to Fg_1. In this case, the system Av = 0 is an ordinary linear equation over F,—1, and its nul

IV. CANONICAL FEASIBLE ASSIGNMENT FOR ANY EVEN OVERLAP

In this section, we assume that the finite field has characteristic two. We present a constructive example of a finite-
field extension that always satisfies the orthogonality condition for any CSS pair whose corresponding rows overlap in
an even number of positions. This baseline serves as a feasibility witness, showing that for any even-overlap pattern,
it is indeed possible to assign finite-field coefficients that guarantee orthogonality without solving the full system of
multivariate equations. Although this construction does not improve the code distance, it provides a useful canonical
form that clarifies the algebraic structure underlying feasible non-binary assignments.

We first present a baseline separable assignment that witnesses feasibility for any CSS pair whose row-row overlaps
are even.

Definition 1 (Canonical separable assignment (CSA)). Define

because |S; 4/| is even and char(F,) = 2. Hence HpHX = 0 holds for any even overlap size |S;7| € {0,2,4,...},
subsuming in particular the common 0/2-overlap case.
While (4) provides a simple and verifiable construction, we present an example where this construction leads to an
undesirable result.

We define Cx = ker(Hx),Cz = ker(Hz),Cp = ker(Hr),Ca = ker(Ha). It was shown in [5] that extending to
higher-order finite fields can effectively eliminate small-weight logical operators. Even if « € Cx \ C#, the nonzero
entries of Hp were arranged so that there exists no vector € having exactly the same support as a and satisfying
€ € Cr \ Cx. By doing so, we were able to increase the minimum distance of the code.

However, this mechanism does not apply when the coefficients are assigned according to the CSA, since its separable
structure preserves all binary codewords up to scalar multiples. In this case, for any x € Cx, there always exists a
vector € with the same support satisfying € € Cp. Specifically, one can take

gj = a Ca;.

Using the same argument as in Section IV, we obtain

since @ € Cy. Therefore, € € Cp. Hence, to eliminate such short logical operators, one must instead employ the
approach based on solving the exponent congruence equations described in the previous section.

V. CONCLUSION

We have presented a systematic method for extending binary CSS codes to non-binary finite-field representations
while preserving both the original support pattern and the orthogonality condition. By formulating the orthogonality
constraint as a sparse system of linear congruences among integer exponents, we showed that feasible non-binary
assignments can be efficiently obtained.

As a baseline, we introduced the CSA, which guarantees feasibility for any CSS pair with even row-row overlaps.
While the CSA provides a simple and verifiable construction, it preserves all binary codewords and thus cannot remove
short logical operators. To overcome this limitation, we emphasized the importance of solving the exponent congruence
equations and applying local rank conditions on small supports, which enable the elimination of low-weight logical
operators in the non-binary extension.

The proposed finite-field framework clarifies the algebraic structure underlying feasible non-binary CSS codes and
opens up new possibilities for designing high-performance quantum LDPC and qudit codes. Future work includes
applying this approach to HGP codes as well as to higher-degree quantum APM-LDPC and QC-LDPC codes [9], and
evaluating their joint belief-propagation decoding performance.
