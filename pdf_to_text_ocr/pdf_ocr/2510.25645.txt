Abstract

We present a dataset generated to investigate urban heat and ther-
mal perception across five neighborhoods in the Barcelona metropolitan
area. In collaboration with 14 non-academic partner organizations, we
conducted a series of citizen science campaigns involving 439 residents
as co-researchers engaged throughout all stages of the research process.
Participants—tresidents of areas classified as highly or very highly climate-
vulnerable—identified 210 public outdoor sites relevant to their daily lives.
These locations were subsequently characterized using a range of spatial
and environmental indicators pertinent to urban heat island effects, urban
health, and climate resilience. Over the course of 48 thermal walks, par-
ticipants carried portable, low-cost sensors that continuously recorded air
temperature, relative humidity, and geolocation, resulting in 296,286 pro-
cessed microclimatic data points. At pre-defined sites, individuals com-
pleted standardized surveys to report their Thermal Sensation Votes and
Thermal Comfort Votes, yielding 5,169 self-reported entries. Sociode-
mographic data were also collected to further contextualize participants’
responses. The resulting dataset integrates objective environmental mea-
surements with subjective perceptions of heat, enabling point-by-point
analysis of thermal experience within the urban fabric. It offers a novel,
multi-dimensional resource to support research on heat, thermal inequal-
ity, and the experiential dimensions of climate vulnerability, and is in-
tended to inform evidence-based decision-making in urban planning, pub-
lic health, and climate adaptation.

Background & Summary

Rising global temperatures and more frequent heat waves are among the most
significant consequences of climate change [I] 2]. Urban environments are par-
ticularly affected by high temperatures due to the urban heat island effect [3} [4].
The combination of dense built environments, limited vegetation, and high en-
ergy consumption elevates ambient temperatures in urban areas [5]. Public
outdoor spaces play a critical role in shaping both thermal conditions and resi-
dents’ capacity to cope with heat: they can either magnify heat stress through
lack of shade and extensive hard surfaces or help mitigate it by offering cooling
features and refuge {6} [7] [8}.

Extreme urban heat conditions exacerbate health risks [9], particularly among
vulnerable populations such as older adults, children, and individuals with pre-
existing medical conditions [10] [II]. These risks compound existing inequities
in the spatial distribution of heat exposure and its consequences [12) [13] [14].
Marginalized populations—characterized by significant racial and income dis-
parities [12], as well as groups such as the elderly and women [13] —experience
disproportionate exposure to elevated urban heat intensity and face reduced
adaptive capacity. This intersection of socioeconomic, gender, and age-related
factors illustrates the multifaceted nature of heat inequities [[4]. Comprehensive
datasets that capture socio-demographic disparities in heat exposure—together
with detailed information on the urban fabric—are essential for supporting eq-
uitable public health policies and data-driven climate adaptation strategies in
urban environments (16) [17].

Recent research highlights the value of citizen science approaches for collect-
ing environmental data in situ, at scales and resolutions difficult to achieve with
conventional monitoring networks [18] {19} [20] [21]. Recent systematic literature
reviews critically examine the evolving role of citizen science in advancing urban
sustainability, planning, and transformative action [22] [23]. Studies in this con-
text highlight how citizen-generated data and participatory research approaches
can inform policy, foster inclusive decision-making, and support the co-creation
of more resilient and equitable urban environments [24] [25) [26].

Citizen science is taking a growing role in understanding and addressing
urban heat phenomena [22] [23]. Citizen-generated data have proven valuable
for detecting and mapping urban heat (and cool) islands and heat exposure
with high spatial and temporal resolution [27| [28] [29] [30] [31] [32]. Such ap-
proaches complement satellite and model-based measurements, offering hyper-
local insights that are often inaccessible through conventional monitoring sys-
tems [28] [33] [34] (35). Research points to the value of citizen science in revealing
ecological responses to urban heat and in characterizing both hot and cool ur-
ban zones across cities [36] [37] [38] [39] [40]. In addition to data generation, urban
heat citizen science initiatives enhance public engagement and awareness of cli-
mate challenges, fostering co-learning and action-oriented strategies for heat
adaptation [27] [41].

Originating in the field of urban studies, thermal walks investigate pedestrian
thermal perception by integrating analyses of urban microclimate and spatial

morphology [42]. We argue that this methodology holds significant promise
within the framework of citizen science, particularly in its capacity to engage
individuals directly in the co-production of climate knowledge. Walking is con-
ceptualized as a dynamic and situated practice that foregrounds the experiential
diversity of urban environments [43]. The methodology combines environmen-
tal monitoring with real-time subjective surveys, enabling a dual exploration of
objective climatic conditions and lived thermal experiences [42].

Thermal walks involve point-to-point assessments of thermo-spatial varia-
tion, capturing how individuals perceive and respond to heat while moving
through the urban fabric [44]. By aligning microclimatic and spatial data with
individuals’ perceptions, thermal walks facilitate a fine-grained understanding of
the interplay between built form, environmental conditions, and thermal com-
fort [42]. In recent years, this methodology has been further developed and
adapted across diverse urban settings and socio-demographic groups, serving as
a valuable tool to investigate heat exposure, thermal inequality, and the expe-
riential dimensions of climate vulnerability [38] [45] [46] [47].

The current Data Descriptor paper therefore presents a dataset generated
through the Heat Chronicles citizen science campaigns conducted in the Barcelona
metropolitan area. This region, situated in Catalonia, Spain, is classified as
having a Mediterranean climate (Csa) according to the Képpen climate classi-
fication system [48]. However, the accelerating impacts of climate change have
raised questions about whether this classification remains adequate for captur-
ing emerging climatic realities in the region [49].

The Heat Chronicles implemented a series of thermal walks aiming to in-
corporate public participation at all stages of the research process. These cam-
paigns can be situated within the framework of citizen social science, which
highlights the active role of co-researchers—residents who possess local, expe-
riential knowledge of their neighborhoods and who share a collective concern
about urban heat—in shaping both the research questions and outcomes [50)[5IJ.
Custom-designed materials were developed to support the data collection pro-
tocol, to enhance participant engagement and transform the process into an
enjoyable experience. These materials also served to increase the campaign’s
visibility within the neighborhood context.

The campaigns were designed to investigate urban heat and perception
across several neighborhoods identified as having high or very high climate vul-
nerability [52]. Residents were recruited from diverse communities within these
areas, in collaboration with 14 partner organizations. The individuals belonged
to social groups identified in the literature as particularly vulnerable to ex-
treme urban heat [9] [10] [12] [13]. For each thermal walk, groups were composed
to be socially homogeneous (e.g., similar age range, similar socio-demographic
profile), enabling targeted comparative analyses. Prior to data collection, par-
ticipants attended structured preparatory workshops to collaboratively identify
outdoor public sites of daily relevance for inclusion in the thermal walk protocol.
Selected sites were categorized by public use, emphasizing their role in shaping
everyday thermal experiences. Following data collection, participants discovered
data from the the selected sites and the involved routes to explore and interpret

SCIENTIFIC
DATA

the results collectively, promoting both awareness and action. Finally, key find-
ings were shared with neighborhood residents, local organizations, and policy
makers through diverse formats and channels, reinforcing the community-driven
dimension of the research.

Thermal walks followed pre-defined routes during which individuals car-
ried portable MeteoTracker sensors that continuously recorded air temperature,
relative humidity, and GPS coordinates—whose accuracy has been validated
[53] [54]. At designated sites along each route, individuals completed structured
surveys designed to capture their perceptions of heat, thermal comfort, and
contextual factors. These surveys were adapted from standardized thermal per-
ception instruments. Specifically, we collected Thermal Sensation Votes (TSVs)
and Thermal Comfort Votes (TCVs), which reflect subjective assessments of
temperature and comfort, respectively.

Thermal sensation is a well-established parameter in thermal comfort re-
search [55], formally defined in ISO 7730 and ASHRAE Standard 55 [57].
In temperate climates, it is recommended to use a 7-point scale ranging from
"cold" to "hot" [58), while 9-point scales with added "very cold" and "very
hot" categories are recommended for extreme climate conditions [38]. To better
capture extreme heat events—frequently encountered during the Heat Chron-
icles campaigns—we adapted the original 9-point thermal sensation scale by
removing the “cold” and “very cold” categories from the response ballots.

In contrast, thermal comfort is defined by ASHRAE Standard 55 [57] as “that
condition of mind which expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment.”
It reflects a broader psychological construct that integrates, but is not restricted
to, thermal sensation. TCVs were recorded using a 7-point scale ranging from
“very uncomfortable” to “very comfortable,” following established methodologies
in thermal comfort research [38] [55]. We extended standard thermal comfort
instruments by adding an item that asked respondents to rate their thermal
comfort while walking from the previous site to the current one. Similar walking-
focused field protocols have demonstrated sensitivity to thermo-spatial variation
and microclimatic transitions in urban routes [59]. To ensure data quality and
support, each walk was accompanied by a trained member of the research team,
who provided instruction on sensor use and facilitated the administration of
surveys.

The dataset compiled through the Heat Chronicles citizen science campaigns
provides a unique open-access resource on human heat perception. The dataset
is highly diverse, both in terms of the neighborhoods included—all classified
as highly or very highly climate-vulnerable—and in the sociodemographic pro-
files of participants, which range from children aged 9-11 to older adults. It
includes contributions from 439 participants across 48 distinct walking trajec-
tories, covering over 300 kilometers within the Barcelona metropolitan area. In
total, the campaigns generated 448 654 geolocated microclimatic records using
portable sensors, resulting in 296 286 processed records. These are paired with
1867 Thermal Sensation Votes (TSVs), 1867 Thermal Comfort Votes (TCVs),
and 1435 Thermal Comfort Votes while walking (wT'CVs), totaling 5169 per-
ceptual votes. The dataset also includes 210 geolocated points of interest and

SCIENTIFIC

DATA 6verleaf

the specific transects that connect them. Additionally, participants provided so-
ciodemographic information, including age, gender, typical time spent in public
space, and neighborhood familiarity.

The 210 geolocated outdoor public sites included in the dataset were each
categorized according to their public function within two broad domains: Basic
Needs and Well-being and Free Time. These sites span diverse public typolo-
gies—such as streets, squares, parks, playgrounds, and green areas—alongside
areas surrounding key public infrastructure, including transport hubs, schools,
primary care centers, libraries, and cultural venues. For each site, additional
spatial and environmental descriptors were gathered, including surface type,
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Sky View Factor (SVF),
all of which are established determinants of urban heat island intensity and
thermal perception (61). Furthermore, climate adaptation and mitigation
indicators—such as distance to the nearest public fountain, green space, or des-
ignated climate shelter—were incorporated to augment the dataset’s relevance
for urban health and climate resilience research. In addition, the dataset also
includes for each site the Index of Vulnerability to Climate Change (IVAC, from
the Catalan acronym, a composite index developed for the Barcelona metropoli-
tan region assessing environmental and social vulnerability to climate change at
neighborhood scale) [52].

The resulting dataset offers a multi-layered perspective by integrating high-
resolution environmental sensor data, geospatial context, subjective assessments
of heat perception, and vulnerability indicators, thereby enabling nuanced anal-
yses of thermal comfort and equity in urban environments. By combining low-
cost, easy-to-use sensors with structured surveys and community engagement,
this work contributes to ongoing discussions on how heat vulnerability is de-
fined and measured [9} {12| [73], particularly with respect to public space
(5) {61 [7]. It also highlights the role of citizen social science {50} in advanc-
ing more inclusive approaches to climate adaptation and environmental justice
(14. The dataset enables analysis of spatial variability in urban microclimates
and their relationship to perceived thermal discomfort [42]. Furthermore, the
publicly available data support investigations into how heat vulnerability varies
across socio-demographic groups and public space typologies, providing an evi-
dence base for equitable public health policies and climate adaptation strategies
in urban settings. By sharing data and protocols, this paper also encourages
the development of open participatory urban planning practices that foreground
residents’ lived experiences in identifying priority areas for cooling interventions.
Therefore, the dataset shared offers a timely and valuable resource for the grow-
ing body of research on urban outdoor thermal comfort, providing actionable
insights to support equitable climate adaptation in vulnerable urban contexts

Methods

The Universitat de Barcelona Ethics Committee (IRB00003099) approved the
Heat Chronicles citizen science campaigns. For the participation of primary
and secondary schools, additional approval was obtained from the Catalonia
Education Department. All participants aged 18 years or older provided written
informed consent prior to data collection. For participants under 18 years of
age, consent was obtained from a parent or legal guardian following established
procedures.

No personal data were collected. Each participant was assigned a random
identification number. The sociodemographic information collected (e.g., gen-
der, age range) does not permit individual identification. No privacy concerns
were identified that would preclude the public release of the processed data.
GPS trajectories of the thermal walks do not contain information about partic-
ipants’ home locations, as all routes originated from designated public spaces,
typically squares or parks.

Locations, community partners and participants

The participation of local communities was a central component of the research
design for the Heat Chronicles campaigns. In the Barcelona metropolitan area,
neighborhoods particularly vulnerable to extreme heat were identified using pub-
licly available data sources, including the Index of Vulnerability to Climate
Change (IVAC) [52].

Based on these and other indicators of heat vulnerability, several potential
partner institutions were contacted in spring 2023 to establish collaborations.
This initial outreach enabled a pilot study conducted in summer 2023, imple-
mented in four locations in partnership with a public library, a primary school,
a secondary school, and a civil society organization (CSO). The pilot phase
served to refine the scientific methodology, adjust experimental protocols, and
evaluate the overall feasibility of the project. Building on the initial experience
from summer 2023, the network of partners was expanded in 2024 to include
five locations (cities or neighborhoods within the Barcelona metropolitan area;
see Table

For consistency, each location is referred to by the abbreviations provided in
TablefI] throughout the text, tables, and figures of this manuscript. The neigh-
borhoods or small cities of SP, CI, CT, and MR all have an IVAC greater than
61, placing them among the most climate-vulnerable locations in the Barcelona
metropolitan area [52]. Despite this shared vulnerability, these locations differ
significantly in population size and density. Population figures currently ranged
from around 14000 residents in CI (a neighborhood within Barcelona) to over
30000 in the small city of MR. According to 2021 data, CT and MR were the
most densely populated areas, with 497.7 and 411.4 inhabitants per hectare, re-
spectively, while SV was the most spatially dispersed, with only 31.2 inhabitants
per hectare.

Although SV scores an IVAC index slightly lower, it would also rank among

SCIENTIFIC
DATA

6verleaf

the most vulnerable areas if only socio-economic factors were considered [52].
Average income per person ranges from 12304 EUR in CT to 15,870 EUR in
Cl—both below Barcelona’s citywide average of 17350 EUR. Access to public
green space is highly uneven, with SV offering the most (20.28 m? per inhabi-
tant) and CT the least (2.18 m?). Educational attainment further underscores
structural inequality. In MR, 72.4% of the population has completed only pri-
mary or lower secondary education, compared to just 26.9% in SP—a gentrified
neighborhood experiencing significant tourism pressure. Taken together, these
indicators reveal sharp spatial, socioeconomic, and educational contrasts. These
contextual data are critical for designing equitable, data-driven urban climate
adaptation strategies at the local level.

A total of 14 institutions, representing a range of organizational types and
spanning the five municipalities, actively participated in the campaigns. These
institutions are reported in Table 2] Diverse participant groups, varying in age
and sociodemographic characteristics, engaged in the campaigns. Particular
attention was given to including groups in more vulnerable situations, such as
children, adolescents, and older adults, as well as individuals who regularly
spend extended periods in public spaces (e.g., toddlers’ families, summer camp
participants). Participant characteristics are summarized in Table 3]

Table [4] presents the sociodemographic profile of the 439 unique partici-
pants who took part in the thermal walks. The profile includes gender identity,
age range, time spent in outdoor public spaces, and self-reported knowledge
of their neighborhood. These participants contributed a total of 1,867 TSVs,
1867 TCVs, and 1435 wP'CVs—tesulting in 5 169 self-reported entries collected
across 210 public outdoor sites. Tables 5 6 and 9] provide the correspond-
ing sociodemographic breakdowns for each of the five locations.

Table summarizes overall statistics for the thermal walks and how the
data is distributed across the five locations, including the number of groups
(thermal walks), participants, surveyed sites, and thermal surveys collected.

Working sessions with participants

In each neighborhood and for each participant group, three participatory ses-
sions were conducted over three consecutive weeks during May, June, or July
2024 as summarized in Figure[I] The scheduling of these sessions was adapted
to align with participants’ availability—for example, coordinating with school
calendars or summer camp schedules. Each session lasted approximately 1.5
to 2 hours, with formats tailored to the specific characteristics and needs of
each group. For instance, child-friendly formats such as games and quizzes were
added to further engage younger participants. While delivery formats slightly
varied to better suit each audience, the core content remained consistent across
all sessions everywhere. The Heat Chronicles campaigns followed a community-
based approach, with a dedicated team member—trained in community facilita-
tion—ensuring an inclusive and welcoming environment throughout the process.

Session 1 (indoor and outdoor)

The research team delivered a presentation introducing the concept of citizen
science, outlining the rationale for the Heat Chronicles campaigns—including
urban heat islands and heat inequity—and explaining their objectives along
with the planned research steps.

This was followed by two participatory and interactive activities as described
in Figure [I] In Activity 1, participants collaboratively mapped public spaces
within their neighborhood, classifying and prioritizing them based on perceived
relevance. The classification followed the categories provided by the research
team. Large-format printed maps of each neighborhood (AO size) were used
during the activity (see Figure[I). Participants identified and named relevant
public space sites, marked them them on the map, and assigned them to one
of the predefined categories using corresponding color codes. These categories
were grouped into two overarching macro categories—Basic Needs and Wellbe-
ing and Free Time—teflecting the different functions that public spaces serve
in daily life as outlined in Table [iJ] [y] Each specific site was assigned a short
code to support data labeling and visualization during a discussion phase. This
classification scheme helped guide participants’ selection and prioritization of
public spaces and ensured consistency in the thermal data collected across di-
verse urban environments. In Activity 2, the concepts of thermal sensation and
thermal comfort were introduced. The session concluded with a collective re-
hearsal of the thermal walk data collection protocol, which is described in detail
in a dedicated section below.

Session 2 (outdoor)

Thermal walks were conducted during this session, covering the prioritized sites
identified by participants (see Figur and description in the following sec-
tions). The analysis focused exclusively on outdoor public areas and adjacent
surroundings of indoor public sites, such as squares in front of primary health
care centers, public libraries, or theaters.

Routes from each campaign were designed by the research team to include
the identified sites agreed at the end of session 1. A member of the research team
was then in charge to finetune all paths, maximizing the number of public sites
visited and optimizing their feasibility, in terms of duration and total length of
the trajectories. An example of simultaneous thermal walks for CT is presented
in Figure

All participants convened at a designated starting point, and multiple groups
conducted their walks simultaneously to collect both environmental measure-
ments and perceptual data (see following sections for logistical and method-
ological details). Most thermal walks included between three and five stops,
comprising the initial and final surveys at the starting point, as well as interme-
diate measurement sites. A few walks included more than five stops, resulting
in additional measurement points beyond the start and end sites. Group sizes
ranged from 6 to 12 participants. Approximately half of the walking trajecto-

SCIENTIFIC
DATA

6verleaf

ries spanned between 1.5 km and 2.4 km. The session was not longer than 2
hours despite spending much fewer time walking. Several minutes (see the data
collection protocol below) were allocated for organizing the groups, reviewing
the protocol, conducting thermal surveys—during which participants remained
stationary—and closing the session.

Session 3 (indoor and outdoor)

Once the data collection was completed, the research team began by recapping
the main characteristics of the thermal walks, including the itineraries, group
organization, and participants’ initial reflections. Preliminary scientific findings
were also presented to stimulate discussion. In Activity 1, participants engaged
in a collective interpretation of the data, drawing on their lived experience and
local knowledge to contextualize the observed thermal patterns. This process
included comparing sensor-based measurements with their own thermal percep-
tions and identifying relevant spatial features (e.g., shaded areas, open spaces, or
material types). In some sessions, this was complemented by collaborative map-
ping or annotation exercises. Activity 2 (optional) involved preparing posters to
communicate the results to the broader community. These posters summarized
key findings and were displayed in relevant public spaces to raise awareness and
foster dialogue on outdoor thermal comfort. Figure[1]shows one of these posters.

In a later stage, some of the results contributed to neighborhood-level dis-
cussions on climate mitigation strategies during the neighborhood council in
CI. In CT, participants featured in television news reports at both local and
regional levels, as well as in a nationally broadcast documentary. Local orga-
nizations in CT are using the findings to advocate for concrete actions. Issues
such as the lack of public drinking water fountains, shaded areas, and tree cover
were clearly identified. Heat Chronicles was also invited by the municipality to
participate in the Smart City Congress. In SV, the results were shared with
both the municipal administration and the children’s council, fostering inter-
generational dialogue. The citizen science campaigns also received local media
attention, with several appearances on local radio. Specific demands were voiced
to protect the football pitch frequently used by children from excessive heat and
to improve accessibility to a nearby large green area. In SP, the CSO involved
showed particular interest in sites highlighted during the thermal walks, as these
locations serve as important gathering spaces for the community. The SP neigh-
borhood is characterized by narrow streets and a significant lack of green areas.
To support broader awareness and transparency, public reports summarizing
the findings and key recommendations are being published and made accessible
to the general public.

Thermal walks

A thermal walk is defined here as a structured group walk along a pre-established
route during which participants measure ambient temperature and systemati-
cally record their subjective perceptions of heat and thermal comfort [42]. Dur-
SCIENTIFIC
DATA

6verleaf

ing the Heat Chronicles thermal walks, geolocated temperature, pressure, and
humidity data were collected using MeteoTracker low-cost sensors, which have
been shown to provide robust and sufficiently precise measurements in urban
environments [53]. Perceptual data were gathered through thermal surveys ad-
ministered at stops located at predefined outdoor sites, following questionnaires
similar to those employed in previous studies on outdoor thermal comfort [38].
The survey instruments were developed in accordance with ISO 7730 and
ASHRAE Standard 55 [57], including standardized scales for thermal sensation
votes (TSVs), thermal comfort votes (TCVs) and thermal comfort votes while
walking (wT'CVs) .

Materials

We create our own materials to deploy the thermal walks. The experimental
design was guided by three main principles: (i) collecting reliable scientific data,
(ii) using lightweight and easy-to-transport materials, and (iii) making the ex-
periment visible to the neighborhood while ensuring an enjoyable experience for
participants. Based on these principles, the Heat Chronicles campaign graphic
identity was developed, and a set of specially designed materials was produced
(see Figure [3).

The mobile equipment used for the thermal walks consisted of a commercially
available shopping cart (Basket Tweed 4B Rolser) modified with specially de-
signed panels for visibility and usability (see Figure). Each cart was equipped
with two MeteoTracker X sensors (https://meteotracker.com) mounted on top
using the manufacturer’s bicycle-mounting system (Figure Bp). This setup en-
sured that the sensors were consistently oriented in the direction of movement
and positioned at a uniform height of 85 cm from the ground—chosen to ap-
proximate an average torso height across participants in the Heat Chronicles
campaigns, which included both children (aged 9-11) and older adults. Two
sensors were used per cart to increase measurement reliability, reduce fluctua-
tions, and provide redundancy in case of sensor malfunction. The sensors were
connected via the MeteoTracker mobile application to tablets (iPad, with the
iOS operating system and 1GB of high-speed 4G connectivity) stored inside the
cart, enabling continuous recording of geolocated microclimatic data (tempera-
ture, humidity, and pressure) throughout the walks.

To capture participants’ subjective perceptions of heat, a custom-designed
ballot box was stored inside the cart (see Figure [3p). Before starting a thermal
walk, each participant received an envelope with a lanyard containing up to
seven ballots and a pen. The ballots, whose graphic design is shown in Fig.
featured distinct drawings to facilitate easy identification. At each stop,
participants completed a ballot reflecting their heat perception and deposited
it into the ballot box. Each ballot included a randomly assigned participant
ID, ensuring anonymity as the research team could not link IDs to individual
participants.

Logistics and supervision

The number of simultaneous thermal walks conducted in each location required
careful logistical planning. One member of the team coordinated all organi-
zational aspects, including preparing the materials and ensuring their timely
shipment to the different sites.

The research team also arranged the composition of the participant groups,
aiming for groups that were as homogeneous as possible in terms of age and of
a manageable size, typically between 6 and 12 participants.

Altogether, up to 15 team members accompanied the different participant
groups. Eight were members of the research team, while seven were students
from the Faculty of Physics of the Universitat de Barcelona. All facilitators
were trained to implement the scientific protocol rigorously and were provided
with a printed guide detailing each step of the procedure. On the day of the
walks, the team convened at the meeting point one hour in advance to prepare
all materials. One person was specifically responsible for setting up the sensors
and connecting the tablets. Before starting, the logistics coordinator conducted
a briefing to ensure a shared understanding of the protocol and any relevant
information about the neighborhood context.

In each participant group, a team member acted as the “group driver,” re-
sponsible for guiding the route and recording information in the driver’s sheet,
translated into English in Table[12). For groups including children and youth
under 18 years of age, a teacher or educator also accompanied the walk. When-
ever possible, the drivers conducted a rehearsal walk in advance to familiarize
themselves with the route and anticipate any challenges.

Thermal walk data collection protocol

An equipped cart was placed in a shaded area at the meeting point where all
simultaneous walks for a given location began and ended. A pair of “fixed sen-
sors” remained in this site for the entire duration of the thermal walks in the
location. These sensors were supervised by a team member to ensure a contin-
uous and reliable record of temperature at a static reference point throughout
the activity. All carts equipped with MeteoTracker sensors were positioned at
the meeting points (starting and ending point of the walks), with sensors acti-
vated approximately 10 minutes before the walk began to ensure temperature
alignment with ambient conditions.

At the meeting point, participants were divided into several groups. Each
group was accompanied by one or two team members, including a designated
group driver. The group driver introduced themselves and asked participants for
their first names—although in most cases, they had already met during the first
session. Participants were invited to take on different voluntary roles: guide
(receiving a printed map with the route and stops), cart driver (responsible
for pushing the equipment cart), and coordinator (ensuring all group members
remained together). Roles could be rotated among participants during the walk.

Sociodemographic survey: Before departing, the group driver asked par-
SCIENTIFIC
DATA

6verleaf

ticipants to complete the ballot corresponding to the sociodemographic survey
. The driver also recorded general group information
(such as the total number of participants and their approximate age range, see
Table[12) on the driver’s sheet to allow cross-checking of the individual sociode-
mographic data. Completed ballots were deposited in the ballot box stored
inside the cart.

First thermal sensation and comfort votes: The group driver reminded
participants of the distinction between thermal sensation and thermal comfort.
Participants were then asked to complete (with no interaction with their peers)
the first thermal perception survey, corresponding to Ballot 1 (see Fig. and
Table [14). The driver announced the site code, which participants copied onto
their ballots. This code consisted of a three-part sequence: the first number
indicated the group number, the letter represented the date of the walk, and
the final number identified the ballot (e.g, 1V1 for Ballot 1, and 1V2 for Ballot
2 in campaign V and cart 1). Once completed, all ballots were collected in the
ballot box stored inside the cart.

‘Walk to the first and subsequent pre-identified sites: The group
proceeded together to the first designated site at a normal walking pace. The
group driver and the participant assigned the role of guide indicated the path
to follow. The same procedure applied to each subsequent transect between
consecutive pre-identified sites.

Stop in a public outdoor pre-identified site: The sites were pre-marked
on the ground, geolocated using Google MyMaps, and shared with all drivers
in advance. Once the group arrived at a pre-identified site, the group driver
recorded the exact time and engaged participants in a brief conversation unre-
lated to heat. After 3-5 minutes of being stopped, the driver announced the
corresponding site code, which participants wrote on their ballots. The waiting
period was intended both to allow air temperature alignment and to help par-
ticipants become fully aware of the thermal conditions at the site. The driver
then asked participants to complete Ballot 2 (see oh H and Table [I5) . Mean-
while, the driver filled in the driver’s sheet (see Table|12). All ballots were then
collected in the ballot box.

This procedure was repeated at each stop on the pre-identified sites. The
final stop corresponded to the initial meeting point, as the routes were circular,
with all groups converging after completing their thermal walks. At this final
stop, participants completed the last round of votes.

The group drivers then invited participants to share feedback about the ex-
perience and reminded them of the date for the third session. The scientific
team checked that all sensors had correctly recorded the journeys and that the
data were successfully transferred to the MeteoTracker server. Finally, the sen-

sors were disconnected, and the ballots from each box were placed in a separate
envelope labeled with the group number and the name of the group driver.

Data filtering and processing

The data collected during the thermal walks can be organized into two distinct
datasets. The first dataset comprises high-resolution, geolocated microclimatic
measurements—trajectories—recorded by the MeteoTracker sensors throughout
the walks. The second dataset contains the responses to the thermal surveys ad-

Processing and filtering of sensor trajectories

As mentioned in previous sections, two sensors were mounted on each cart to
improve measurement accuracy and ensure reliable data collection in the event
of sensor failure, connectivity loss, or poor data quality. The sensors recorded
geolocated microclimatic data at a very high temporal resolution. Specifically,
59% of the records were collected at one-second intervals and 41% at two-second

intervals.

Only 0.03% of records were separated by three or more seconds,
likely due to transient GPS or Bluetooth connection issues, but these cases are

two sensors mounted on a cart failed for various reasons. Figure [6] illustrates
a sample thermal walk, showing a heatmap of geolocated temperature readings
alongside the time series of temperature and humidex (HDX) recorded during
the walk.

Step 1: Remove empty and irrelevant columns. Each individual
dataset initially contained 28 columns. Most of these columns were empty or
corresponded to functionalities not supported by the MeteoTracker sensor model
we used. Therefore, we retained only the 10 relevant columns (see Table {6}:
Time, Lat, Lon, Temp [°C], Hum [%], Alt [m], Press [mbar], DP [°C], HDX
[°C], and Speed [km/h]. Table [I7] shows an example of a raw trajectory file.

Step 2: Perform linear interpolation. For many statistical analyses,
it is preferable to work with uniformly spaced records. This also facilitates
averaging measurements from the two sensors mounted on each cart, since the
variables must be aligned to the same timestamps. Therefore, we applied a linear
interpolation procedure to fill all gaps where consecutive records were separate:
by more than one second. This processing ensured that all records were evenly
spaced in time (at one-second intervals). After interpolation, the total number
of records increased from 448 654 to 637619 (a 40% increase). Although the
number of records grew substantially, the overall data distributions remainec
unaffected (see Technical Validation section, Figure [7p and Figure [7p).

Step 3: Average the two sensors from the same cart. To improve
data reliability, we averaged the readings from the two sensors mounted on each
cart at every timestamp (1-second intervals). This averaging was performed over
the overlapping time interval between the two sensors—defined as the perioc
from the latest starting time to the earliest ending time where both sensors were
actively recording. In cases where a cart collected data from only one sensor,
we retained the available single-sensor data without averaging. As a result, the
number of individual trajectories was reduced from 124 to 61, with a total o
296 286 records in the processed dataset. The Technical Validation section
and Figure [7 and Figure [/}| illustrate how this averaging procedure reduces
noise in both temperature and humidex measurements.

Last step: Shift temperatures. We corrected the temperature data to
mitigate the effect of natural temperature variation over the course of the day.
During a given trajectory, ambient temperature may gradually increase or de-
crease due to the diurnal cycle. As a result, a sensor might capture this temporal
trend, potentially leading to misleading interpretations when comparing tem-
peratures between two sites that were recorded at different times along the same
trajectory. We thus shifted the temperature at each timestamp t; by subtract-
ing the temperature recorded by the fixed-station sensor located at the starting
(and ending) point of the trajectory:

T (ti) = T(ti) — Tyivea(ts). (1)

This subtraction removes broad temporal trends from spatial temperature dif-
ferences, which typically results in small temperature changes (on the order of a
few decimal degrees), either positive or negative. A second optional adjustment

adds back the average temperature recorded by the fixed-station over the entire
duration of the trajectory, shifting the data back to a range more representative
of actual atmospheric conditions while preserving relative spatial differences:

We

applied the same procedure to the humidex, thereby adding four additional

columns to each trajectory dataset (two for temperatures and two for humidex).

Processing and filtering fixed-station sensor data. As described above,

a cart equipped with two sensors was placed at the starting point of each ther-
mal walk, which also served as the ending point (i.e., start and end coincide).

For

a result, the fixed-station datasets contain 10 columns (Table :
After processing the sensor data from all trajectories, we obtained a total

jectories (thermal walks), each containing 14 columns: the 10 microclimatic

digitized all individual responses from the thermal perception surveys, along

with the driver sheets corresponding to each thermal walk. To ensure data
accuracy, multiple verification steps were carried out to identify and correct any

ential human errors introduced during the manual data entry process.
In the first stage, for each thermal walk, we created a dedicated dataset
taining the thermal survey responses of the group. Each row corresponds to a

stop at a site where a survey was conducted, and each stop is characterized by 80

colt

umuns. This process yielded 48 individual datasets—one for each group—and

a consolidated dataset aggregating all responses, totaling 210 surveys across all

geolocated outdoor public sites.

site

The sites. For each stop of each trajectory, the first 13 columns include the
code (e.g., 1V4), the name of the outdoor public site, the primary and sec-

ondary categories of the site (e.g., health, education), the city or neighborhood,

the

driver’s anonymized identifier, the date, the arrival time, and the departure

tionally, we derived GPS coordinates from the MeteoTracker sensor data by
averaging the latitude and longitude recorded during the stop’s time window

(from arrival to departure) in the corresponding group trajectory dataset.

The survey. We added 51 additional columns. We first captured infor-

mation recorded by the driver at the beginning of the walk and at each stop

(see Table

These columns include the number of participants in the group,

participants’ ages, how they were dressed, the presence of bad smells at the
survey site, the noise level, the number of people within a 10-meter radius, and

the

by summing the ballors). The next set of columns represents the counts of each
possible response option for every question in the thermal survey (see Fig.
[15). Specifically, we created separate columns for each of the
seven possible responses for thermal comfort (TCV), seven for thermal sensation
(TSV), and so on. The first stop was conducted at the initial site before walk-
ing began. For this reason, the question about thermal comfort while walking
does not appear on the ballot 1; this field is recorded as NaN in the dataset.
Finally, for each question in the thermal survey, we computed and added three
common statistical metrics as additional columns: the mode, the median, and
the interquartile range (IQR). The mode is simply the most frequent response;
if multiple responses tied for the highest count, all modes are stored as a list.
The median identifies the response corresponding to the 50th percentile when
all votes are sorted (for example, for thermal comfort, from “very uncomfort-
able” to “very comfortable”). If there were 12 votes, the 6th vote determines
the median; in the case of an odd number of votes (e.g., 11), we considered
the responses at ranks 5 and 6 and selected the most frequent as the median.
The interquartile range (IQR) captures the variability by recording the 25th
and 75th percentile responses. For example, with 11 votes, the 25th percentile
corresponds to the 3rd vote (2.75 rounded up), and the 75th percentile to the
8th vote (8.25 rounded down). Both values are saved together as a list.
Temperature and Humidex. We included information on the ambient
temperature and humidex at each site where the group stopped. To obtain these
values, we used data from the sensor trajectories and computed the average for
each variable over the time window defined by the group’s arrival and departure
times at the site. The same procedure was applied to the shifted temperature
values (cf. Eqs. and Q). This process added a total of six columns: three
for temperature (raw, shifted, and shifted with offset) and three for humidex.
Contextual urban information. The last 10 columns describe the contex-
tual and urban characteristics of the outdoor urban public sites corresponding to
each stop. These columns include: the type of surface; the walking distance (in
meters) to the nearest public fountain and to the nearest public drinking foun-
tain (data source: https: //opendata-ajuntament . barcelona. cat/data/en/
dataset/fonts); the distance to the closest urban green space (data source:
https: //opendata-ajuntament .barcelona.cat/data/ca/dataset/arbrat-
; and the Sky View Factor (SVF, data source: https://ide.amb.cat/
Visor/?locale=en), which measures the percentage of visible sky (a higher
SVF indicates more open areas) [61]. We also include the Normalized Difference
Vegetation Index (NDVI, data source: https://www.icgc.cat/en/Data-and-
[products/Tmatge/NDV1), which estimates the amount, quality, and growth of
vegetation based on the normalized difference between reflected infrared and red
light [60]. Additionally, the index of vulnerability to climate change (IVAC, data

shelter are provided (data source: https: //opendata-ajuntament . barcelona.
cat/data/en/dataset/xarxa-refugis-climatics). Finally, two more columns

SCIENTIFIC
DATA

report the mean SVF and mean NDVI values calculated over a 1.5-meter radius
area.

In the second stage, we compiled a comprehensive dataset containing all
individual surveys collected at each stop. Each row represents a unique partic-
ipant’s response to the thermal survey conducted at a specific site (see Figure
4}. The dataset includes a total of 1 867 surveys and 21 columns, capturing: the
participant ID, sociodemographic details (gender, age, time spent in the public
space, and neighbourhood familiarity), the location (city or neighbourhood),
the site code (stop), and responses to each survey question (thermal comfort,
thermal comfort while walking, thermal sensation, wind perception, and sun
exposure). Additionally, the dataset reports the average temperature and hu-
midex recorded for each stop, along with the corresponding shifted values (cf.
and (2h).

Finally, we created a unique dataset with the same structure as the previous
one (which contains all individual responses), but with each record correspond-
ing to a unique participant ID. This dataset includes a total of 439 participants.
Unlike the previous dataset, where each row represents a single record at a
specific site, here the thermal survey responses are aggregated per participant.
Each thermal-related variable is represented as a list of the participant’s re-
sponses across all sites. For example, the thermal comfort field for a given
participant might appear as: /Neutral, Very uncomfortable, Neutral, Comfort-
able, Slightly uncomfortable]. Since temperature and humidex values are tied to
specific sites and not individual participants, they are omitted from this dataset,
resulting in 15 columns instead of 21.

Code availability
The https: / /github .com/ferranlarroyaub/Croniques_de_la_Calor_2024

repository contains the Python code and scripts for processing the input data
and for replicating the data processing and the figures in this manuscript. The
3.8 Python version is used to build the code with the main libraries networkx
and osmnx to plot the trajectories on OpenStreet maps, pandas and numpy to
process, clean and analyze the data in Data-Frame format and performing the
basic statistical calculations, and matplotlib for plotting figures. The Python
code is built in different Jupyter notebook files which contain the detailed de-
scription of the study and the code documentation.

Data Records

The data repository [69] contains both raw and processed datasets, as described
in the Data filtering and processing section. The repository is organized
into four main folders. The original_trajectories folder includes the indi-
vidual trajectories for each group, with geolocated microclimatic data collected
using the MeteoTracker sensors during the thermal walks. The processed_
trajectories folder contains the same trajectories after undergoing the data
SCIENTIFIC

processing procedures. The processed_surveys folder stores all survey re-
sponses associated with each group (trajectory). Finally, the aggregated_
surveys folder contains three files summarizing the aggregated survey data.

Raw trajectories

All the original trajectories for each participating group are stored in the folder
named original_trajectories. The dataset comprises 124 unique trajec-
tories, with a total of 448654 records of microclimatic data captured by the
MeteoTracker sensors. Each file is provided in csv format and can be iden-
tified by the site where the data were collected (see Table {i}, the date, the
assigned cart (group) number, and the sensor number. For example, the file
MR_7june2024_cart_1_sensor_2.csv corresponds to the trajectory recorded
by sensor 2 of cart (group) number 1, in Montcada i Reitzac (MR), on June 7,
2024. Another example is CT_9july2024_fixed_cart_sensor_11.csv which
corresponds to the data recorded by sensor 11 of the fixed-station, in Collblanc-
La Torrassa (L’Hospitalet de Llobregat, CT), on July 9, 2024.

As detailed in the experimental protocol and data processing sections, the
carts were equipped with two sensors to enhance measurement reliability. Upon
examination of the file names, it is easy to identify the two sensors assigned to
the same cart. For example, the files SV_29may2024_cart_2_sensor_3.csv
and SV_29may2024_cart_2_sensor_4.csv correspond to the same trajectory
(cart number 2), recorded using sensors 3 and 4, respectively, for a group from
Sant Viceng dels Horts (SP), on May 29, 2024. Table|17|shows an example of
a csv file display of an individual trajectory.

Filtered and processed trajectories

The processed_trajectories folder in the repository contains the final set
of 61 unique trajectories, obtained after the filtering and processing procedure
described above. Out of the 61 files, 48 correspond to the walking trajectories
(with 14 columns each), and 13 to the fixed-stations (with 10 columns each),
both described in Data filtering and processing section. The total number
of records is 296 286. As with the raw trajectories, each file is in csv format
and can be identified by the location where the data were collected, the date
and the assigned cart (group) number. The difference is that, in this case, the
sensor number is not identified, as the file represents the result of averaging
the data from the two sensors on the same cart. For example, the original
trajectories SV_29may2024_cart_2_sensor_3.csv and SV_29may2024_cart_2
_sensor_4.csv are combined into a processed dataset called SV_29may2024
_cart_2.csv.

Surveys data

The processed_surveys folder contains 48 csv files, each corresponding to a
thermal survey conducted by a group during their thermal walk. Each record in
SCIENTIFIC
DATA

6verleaf

these files represents a unique stop, where all participants responded to questions
about their heat perception at a specific site. Each dataset includes 80 columns,
covering: (i) information about the stop (e.g., site code, category of the public
site, date, and time), (ii) details of the thermal survey (e.g., the number of
responses for each possible answer to each question), and (iii) contextual and
urban characteristics of the site. The average temperature and humidex values
at each stop—calculated from the group’s sensor trajectory—are also included.
Each csv file is identified by the location where the data were collected, the date,
and the assigned cart (group) number, adding the suffix survey. For example,
the file CI_4july2024_survey_cart_1.csv corresponds to the thermal survey
conducted by group (cart) number 1, in El Congrés i els Indians (Barcelona,

CI), on July 4, 2024.

Aggregated surveys data

We provide three csv files with aggregated survey data in the aggregated
_surveys folder. First, the file all_surveys(stops) .csv is a direct aggregation
of all 48 files from the processed_surveys folder. It contains data from all 210
sites where surveys were conducted, with the same 80 columns as the individual
files. The file all_surveys (votes) .csv contains all individual responses. Each
record corresponds to a unique participant’s response at a specific site. As de-
scribed in the Data filtering and processing section, this dataset includes
21 columns covering participants’ sociodemographic information (gender, age,
time spent in the public space, and neighborhood knowledge) along with their
answers to each survey question. Additionally, the average temperature and
humidex values for each site are included. The last file, all_surveys (ID) .csv,
contains the sociodemographic profile and thermal survey responses for each
unique participant ID. This dataset has 439 unique participants, with columns
similar to those in all_surveys(votes).csv but excluding temperature and

humidex data, resulting in 15 columns total.

Technical Validation

Temperature and relative humidity sensor data

Prior to the thermal walks, the twenty MeteoTracker sensors were tested to
verify their proper functioning and to ensure consistent microclimatic measure-
ments when multiple sensors operated concurrently. To this end, a series of
tests employing different sensor combinations were conducted, during which
average temperature (J') and relative humidity (RH) values, as well as their
temporal variations, were analyzed both indoors (within an isolated office en-
vironment) and outdoors (while traversing the streets of Barcelona using the
carts). Results from the indoor tests, presented in Figure ig and summarized
in Table demonstrate consistent sensor performance, with measurements
agreeing within the manufacturer’s specified accuracy of +0.2°C for tempera-
ture (+0.4°C under solar radiation with speed > 7 km/h) and +3% for relative

humidity (https: //meteotracker .com) and reports from a group of researchers
[53] [54]. The outdoor tests, conducted under field conditions, were inherently

more susceptible to environmental influences such as solar radiation and wind
exposure. Although not all sensors participated in these outdoor trials, various
sensor combinations produced satisfactory and consistent results, as evidenced
by the data presented in Table [18] and Figure [10] which depict average temper-
ature and relative humidity values alongside their temporal dynamics. Minor
discrepancies observed are attributed to environmental factors, including dif-
ferential exposure to wind—such as when a cart trails another—and variations
in sunlight exposure experienced by individual sensors while navigating urban
pathways.

Geolocated data

The geolocation of each sensor was obtained via Bluetooth using an iPad tablet
device, as outlined in the Methods. During the outdoor tests, we verified that
the GPS coordinates recorded by the sensors were generally accurate. Minor
discrepancies between sensor locations can be attributed to standard GPS pre-
cision limitations, as well as occasional spatial and natural separation of a few
meters between carts during movement. Figure[1I]presents the GPS trajectories
(latitude and longitude) from three separate walking tests, during which four
sensors—mounted on two carts—collected data simultaneously. The recorded
trajectories demonstrate a high degree of alignment in all tests, indicating c
sistent geolocation performance. However, the third test (Figure:
exhibits slightly noisier GPS signals. This increased variability can probably be
attributed to the urban environment, characterized by narrow streets and tall
buildings, which are known to degrade GPS satellite accuracy. Furthermore,
the high population density of the area, combined with limited sidewalk space,
frequently caused the two carts to become spatially separated by several meters.

Linear interpolation

In the Data filtering and processing section, we detailed the procedures
implemented to clean and preprocess the geolocated microclimatic data col-
lected via MeteoTracker sensors during thermal walks. A fundamental step
in the processing workflow was the application of linear interpolation to stan-
dardize the temporal resolution of the dataset, ensuring that all records were
uniformly spaced at l-second intervals. This interpolation was applied not only
to temperature and humidex values but also to GPS coordinates, thereby gen-
erating interpolated positions along the straight line connecting two recorded
locations separated by more than one second. Given the high spatial and tempo-
ral resolution of the raw data, this interpolation does not compromise the spatial
or statistical integrity of the trajectories. Furthermore, the use of latitude and
longitude expressed in degrees remains valid at this resolution, as the spatial
differences between consecutive points are sufficiently small to approximate the
coordinate system as linear for interpolation purposes.

SCIENTIFIC
DATA

6verleaf

Figures [7h and [7p illustrate the temporal evolution of temperature and hu-
midex (HDX), respectively. Figure displays the projected trajectory (lati-
tude versus longitude), alongside the temporal evolution of both spatial coordi-
nates (Figures[8h and 8p). A visual comparison between interpolated and non-
interpolated data confirms that the overall trajectory patterns remain effectively
unchanged. The average temperature and humidex values are identical across
both datasets, with (T) = 29.28 + 0.02°C and (HDX) = 38.02+0.02°C. Simi-
larly, the total distance traveled along the trajectory—calculated as the sum of
distances between consecutive GPS points—remains consistent at D = 2481.94
meters.

Average two sensors from the same cart

An additional data processing step implemented to improve the accuracy of the
collected measurements involved averaging the readings from the two sensors
mounted on the same cart—applicable to nearly all thermal walks, as most
were conducted using two sensors per cart. Despite the sensors’ high nominal
precision (+0.2°C and +0.4°C under solar radiation with speed > 7km/h),
occasional temperature anomalies, such as transient peaks, can arise due to
sudden environmental variations like changes in sun exposure or airflow. For
example, Figures[7p and[7H, which depict the temporal evolution of temperature
and humidex during a thermal walk, reveal minor discrepancies between the
two sensors on the same cart (indicated by blue and orange lines), particularly
around temperature peaks. Averaging the readings from both sensors (black
line) effectively mitigates these discrepancies, producing a cleaner and more
reliable trajectory.

In the illustrated case, the average temperatures recorded by sensors 11 and
12 are 29.08 +0.02°C and 28.75 +0.02 °C, respectively, while the averaged tem-
perature is 28.92+0.01°C. Similarly, the average humidex values for sensors 11
and 12 are 33.73 + 0.03 °C and 33.44 + 0.02 °C, respectively, with the combined
average yielding 33.59 + 0.02°C. This averaging procedure was also applied to
the GPS coordinates, whereby latitude and longitude values from both sensors
were averaged at each timestamp. As shown in Figures[I]] [8p, (8H, and [8p, the
GPS positions reported by the two sensors generally exhibit strong agreement.
Averaging these coordinates introduces negligible distortion to the spatial tra-
jectories and, in fact, enhances geolocation accuracy in instances where minor
divergence between the sensors’ GPS readings occurs, since they are primarily
subject to satellite error rather than environmental variability.

Usage Notes

This dataset offers valuable opportunities for research in urban climatology, pub-
lic health, and social sciences. Its integration of microclimatic sensor data, spa-
tial and environmental descriptors, and thermal perception surveys allows both
fine-grained analyses of urban heat exposure and comparative studies across
SCIENTIFIC
DATA

6verleaf

neighborhoods, participant groups, and public outdoor space typologies. Poten-
tial applications include the validation of urban heat island models, the study of
socio-demographic inequalities in thermal exposure, and the design of evidence-
based adaptation strategies in climate-vulnerable areas.

The citizen science approach underlying the dataset also makes it relevant for
participatory research and policy-making, providing a concrete example of how
collaborative methodologies can generate high-quality scientific data while fos-
tering community engagement. Although the dataset is specific to the Barcelona
metropolitan area, its structure facilitates comparison with other urban contexts
and encourages replication of the methodology elsewhere. Data quality proto-
cols were systematically applied throughout the campaigns to ensure reliable
sensor measurements and robust survey responses.

Beyond scientific research, the dataset may be used in education and train-
ing, serving as a resource for teaching data analysis, visualization, and participa-
tory methods. Its open accessibility invites reuse and integration with comple-
mentary sources, supporting both academic inquiry and applied decision-making
for more equitable and climate-resilient cities.

All datasets are openly available in the data repository [69]. Raw geolocated
microclimatic measurements obtained with the sensors are provided in the orig-
inal_ trajectories folder, while processed and cleaned trajectories—following the
procedures described in this Data Descriptor—are available in the processed_
trajectories folder. Perceptual data from the thermal surveys can be accessed in
the processed_ surveys and aggregated_ surveys folders. To ensure reproducibil-

ity, the repository https: //github.com/ferranlarroyaub/Croniques_de_
la_Calor_ 2024) provides open Python code in Jupyter Notebooks, allowing

users to replicate data processing steps, reproduce figures presented here, and
extend the analysis and visualization.

Figure 2: Thermal walk routes in one location. Simultaneous thermal
walks conducted on May 30, 2024, in Collblanc-La Torrassa (CT, L’Hospitalet
de Llobregat). Each participant group was assigned a different color to distin-
guish their route. Routes were designed to cover 31 outdoor public sites (red
marks) prioritized by the community—including the starting /ending point (white
star)—which were identified and labeled using predefined alphanumeric codes. A
total of 67 participants were involved, divided into 6 groups corresponding to
6 different routes. Along these routes, thermal surveys collected a total of 959
self-reported entries (TSVs, TCVs and wT'CVs).

Figure 5: Schematic diagram of data processing. We provide both raw and
processed individual trajectories, with geolocated microclimatic sensor data.
Participants’ heat perceptions at each site, along with their sociodemographic
profiles, were digitized. This information was used to build a dataset for each
thermal walk, containing data at each site. We enriched the dataset with ur-
ban contextual indicators for each site (e.g., NDVI, SVF, IVAC). Finally, we
compiled three aggregated files: one with data for all 210 sites, another with
all 1867 unique responses, and a third with the 439 complete response sets by
participant ID.

during the thermal walk and for completing the initial section of the table at
the starting point, which included information about the group. At each sur-
veyed site, the driver recorded environmental observations such as the number
of nearby individuals, ambient noise levels, and the presence and intensity of
unpleasant odors. Additionally, the driver documented the arrival time, the
time of the thermal surveys, and the departure time at each site.

Table 15: Thermal survey: Ballot 2. At each site along the route, the par-
ticipants responded to five questions concerning their heat perception, including
thermal comfort while walking, overall thermal comfort, thermal sensation, wind
perception, and sun exposure. Figure [iH shows the physical form completed by
participants (in Catalan). Each completed ballot is associated with the par-
ticipant’s unique ID and the code corresponding to the site where the survey
was conducted. From ballot 2 onward, the thermal survey questions remained
consistent at all stops in each site along the route.
