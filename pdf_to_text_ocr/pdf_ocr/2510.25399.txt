Using a two-dimensional coarse-grained chain model, planar slits in multilayer graphite crystals
are simulated. It is shown that when covering a linear cavity on the flat surface of a graphite crystal
with a multilayer graphene sheet, an open (unfilled slit) can form only if the cavity width does not
exceed a critical value L» (for width L > Lo, only a closed state of the slit is formed, with the cavity
space filled by the covering sheet). The critical width of the open slit Lo increases monotonically
with the number of layers K in the covering sheet. For a single-layer cavity, there is a finite critical
value of its width Lo < 3 nm, while for two- and three-layer cavities, the maximum width of the
open slit increases infinitely with increasing K as a power function A° with exponent 0 < a < 1.
Inside the crystal, two- and three-layer slits can have stable open states at any width. For a slit with
width L > 7.6 nm, a stationary closed state is also possible, in which its lower and upper surfaces
adhere to each other. Simulation of thermal oscillations showed that open states of two-layer slits
with width L < 15 nm are always stable against thermal oscillations, while wider slits at T > 400 K
transition from the open to the closed state. Open states of three-layer slits are always stable against

thermal oscillations.
I. INTRODUCTION

Nanoscale pores and capillaries are actively studied
due to their importance for understanding many nat-
ural phenomena and their potential applications. For
instance, fluid that is transported through them can
possess new properties, impossible on larger scales [1].
Nanopores are used to study the biophysics and chem-
istry of single molecules [2]. A method for creating
smooth capillaries with precisely controlled dimensions
was proposed, based on van der Waals assembly [3] from
wo atomically flat sheets separated by spacers made of
wo-dimensional crystals [4]. Graphene and its sheets
with a precisely controlled number of layers were used as
he two-dimensional materials [5]. Such assembly allows
creating structures that can be viewed as flat empty slits
a few atoms high within a graphite crystal [6]. Such slits
have been used to study water transport through chan-
nels with heights ranging from one [7] to several tens of
atomic layers [5, 8]. A programmable nanofluidic switch
ased on such channels has been proposed [9].

Internal cavities can also be used as nanoscale pressure
sensors [10-13]. Planar slits in layered structures can
serve as efficient optical waveguides [14]. Other uses for
;wo-dimensional slits are given in the review [15].

When creating nanoslits in graphene and other layered
materials, there is the problem of the stability of the ob-
tained pores to environmental influences. For example,
in one of the early works, nanochannels one atomic layer
high were not stable and collapsed in the experiment [5].

taklinov@chph.ras.ru

In fact, only nanochannels with heights of two, three, or
more layers could be obtained. As shown in a later work,
the inability to obtain nanochannels one layer high was
related to insufficiently careful processing of the edges of
the graphite nanocrystal, which caused channel closure
[7]. Authors of the work [9] proposed a phenomenolog-
ical model to describe the stability of nanoslits. In this
model, pore stability is determined by the balance of van
der Waals interactions between the upper and lower pore
surfaces, the deformation energy of the pore upon col-
lapse, and the capillary pressure caused by nanoconden-
sation of the solvent inside the channel. Although this
model yields results that agree reasonably well with ex-
periment, it pays little attention to the case of a small
number of layers in the upper part of the pore (a con-
tinuum approximation is applied), and also does not ac-
count for the influence of layer sliding and thermal fluc-
tuations. In this work, by using a coarse-grained and
all-atom model of graphene pores, the influence of these
factors on the stability of nanopores will be considered
in more detail.

Graphene sheets (nanoribbons) can easily bend and
slide relative to each other, allowing them to conform to
substrate irregularities [16]. Such high mobility of layers
prevents the formation of large planar cavities (slits) with
a height of several layers, because due to displacement
and bending, the upper and lower layers of the cavity can
approach each other, filling its space [17]. In this work,
using a two-dimensional coarse-grained chain model of a
tilayer crystal, the maximum possible cavity sizes will
be determined. It will be shown that the allowable sizes
depend on the number of layers in the graphene sheets
forming the cavity surface.

Part II describes the two-dimensional coarse-grained
chain model of a multilayer graphite crystal as a system of

parallel linear chains. Section III uses this model to find
stationary states of planar slits formed when covering a
cavity on a flat crystal surface with a multilayer graphene
sheet. Part IV models planar slits inside a graphite crys-
tal, and part V analyzes their stability against thermal
oscillations. Section VI performs simulations using all-
atom 3D models to verify the obtained results. The main
conclusions are presented in the Section VII.

II. CHAIN MODEL OF A MULTILAYER
GRAPHENE SHEET

A graphene sheet is an elastically isotropic material;
its longitudinal and bending stiffnesses weakly depend on
its chirality. Therefore, for definiteness, let us consider
deformations of the sheet in the zigzag direction — see
Fig. 1,a.

Let the sheet lie in the xy plane of three-dimensional
space in its ground state. In the direction of the x-axis
(the zigzag direction), the sheet is a periodic structure
with period a, =r, cos(m/6), where rz = 1.418 A is the
equilibrium length of the C-—C valence bond. The trans-
ational unit cells of this structure are formed by atoms
ocated along lines parallel to the y-axis. If we consider
motions of the graphene sheet where atoms located on
he same vertical line move synchronously, then the dy-
namics of the sheet can be described as displacements of
a linear chain of beads in the xz plane — see Fig. 1,b.
Here, each bead of the chain describes the displacements
of all atoms of the sheet located on the same vertical line
(all atoms having the same coordinates x, z). Such a two-
dimensional chain model was previously used to simulate
the dynamics of rolled carbon nanoribbons [18, 19] and
‘olds in a graphene sheet lying on a flat substrate [20].

The Hamiltonian of such a chain has the form

H= =|; M-(tn, Un) +V (tr) +U(On)|, — (

where n denotes bead index, M, = 12my is the mass of a
bead (mass of a carbon atom), U;, = (pn, Zn) is the vector
specifying the position of the n-th bead, r;, = |vn| is the
distance between neighboring beads n and n + 1 (vector
Vn = Un+1—Un), A, is the angle between adjacent beads
(angle between vectors v,, and —v,,_1).
The longitudinal stiffness of the chain is described by
a harmonic potential
V(r) = solr aj, (2)
where a = ay = 1.228A is the chain period, K, =
405 N/m is the inter-bead interaction stiffness. The
bending stiffness of the chain is described by the potential

U(0) = eo[cos(0) + 1), (3)

where the cosine of the n-th angle cos(@,) =
—(Vn—1,Vn)/Tn—-1Tn, energy €9 = 3.5 eV. With these val-
ues of Kf and eg, the dispersion curves of the chain most

accurately coincide with the dispersion curves of a flat
graphene nanoribbon corresponding to its longitudinal
and bending oscillations [18].

In the chain model, a multilayer graphene sheet corre-
sponds to a system of parallel chains (Fig. 2) with the
Hamiltonian

where k denotes the chain index, and n denotes the bead

nates of the n-th bead of the k-th chain ( is the number
of chains, N is the number of beads in a chain).

The first term in the Hamiltonian (4) gives the ki-
netic energy of the molecular system, the second term
describes the potential energy of the chains

is convenient to use periodic boundary conditions, and
for a sheet of finite size — free boundary conditions.

To find the ground state, one needs to solve the prob-
lem of minimizing the potential energy of the molecular
system

The minimization problem (8) was solved numerically by
he conjugate gradient method (21, 22]. For the chain
tem corresponding to crystalline graphite, the distance
between neighboring chains (layers) is ho = 3.352 A, and
the interaction energy of one bead with a neighboring
chain is Kyo = —52.05 meV. Here, to shift a chain by one
period, an energy barrier of AE = 0.1 meV per bead
must be overcome. For comparison, the adhesion and
pinning energies calculated within the density functional
theory (DFT) approximation are Ey = 49 meV/atom,
AE = 6 meV/atom, respectively [23]. Thus, the two-
imensional chain model describes the interaction energy
of graphite sheets quite accurately, but due to the very
low pinning energy AF, it allows chains to slide almost
freely relative to each other. In three-dimensional models
escribing the interaction energy of atoms in neighboring
graphene layers using the Lennard-Jones (6,12) poten-
tial [24], pinning energy is also underestimated (AE =
0.43 meV/atom). Exact agreement with DFT data can
be obtained in models with the Kolmogorov-Crespi po-
tential for interlayer interactions of atoms [23, 25, 26].
This potential accounts for the dependence of the inter-
action energy on the mutual orientation of the normals to
the graphene sheet, allowing a more accurate description
of the sliding energy surfaces.

In the chain model, the pinning energy can be in-
creased by increasing the chain period a (by using a more
coarse-grained chain). Let us introduce the discreteness
parameter d = a/a,. In order to preserve the linear den-
sity, longitudinal and bending stiffness when increasing
the chain period by a factor of d, the mass of a chain link
must be increased by a factor of d, and the parameters Kv
and eg must be decreased by a factor of d. The parame-
ters of the potential (7) must be changed to preserve the
ground state, the distance between neighboring chains ho
and their interaction energy Eo per chain length a, in the
ground state. Specific values of the changed parameters
are given in Table I. Of course, when increasing the chain
discreteness, the positions of beads no more correspond
to positions of carbon atoms of the graphene sheet, but
in the continuum approximation, the deformations of the
chain will continue to correspond to the deformations of
the sheet.

state with filled cavity space exists. The dependence of
the critical slit width values L, and LZ, on the number
of layers K in the covering sheet is given in Table II. As
can be seen from the table, for a two-layer chain L., Lo
grow monotonically with increasing number of layers K.

Figure 4 shows the dependence of the maximum width
L, on the number of layers K in the covering sheet. As
can be seen from the figure, for a single-layer slit (K’, = 1)
there is a limitation on the size of the unfilled (open) slit.
Regardless of the number of layers in the covering sheet,
the maximum width of the open slit is L, < 2.16 nm
when using the chain model with discreteness d = 1,
Lo < 2.70 nm for d = 2 and L, < 2.88 nm for d =
2.129. For two- and three-layer slits (K, = 2, 3) the
maximum width of the open slit increases monotonically
with increasing number of layers in the covering sheet as

FIG. 5: View of the stationary state of a single-layer slit in
a multilayer crystal with width L, = aN, for N, = 10, 11,
12, 13 (a, b, c, d). Chain period a = 2a, (chain discreteness
d=2).

For a two-layer slit, the exponent is a = 0.17, 0.4, and for
a three-layer one — a = 0.22, 0.52 (values obtained using
the chain model with chain discreteness d = 1 and d =
2,2.129). Thus, increasing the discretization parameter d
leads to an increase in the maximum slit width L,. This
width is influenced by the ability of the upper layer to fill
the slit, which is related to the possibility of longitudinal
movement of the edges of this layer. When d increases,
this possibility decreases, as the pinning energy increases.

Note that the critical slit width L, does not depend
on the length of the covering chain L = (N — 1)a, if
N > Nj. For example, for K, = 2, K = 1, the value
Lo = 3.93 nm (N, = 15) is obtained for N = 90, 180, 360,
while for N = 45 the width is L, = 3.68 nm (N, = 14),
for N = 25 the width is L, = 3.44 nm (Ny, = 13).

The obtained dependencies L,(K) allow us to conclude
that inside a graphite crystal (multilayer graphene sheet),
single-layer unfilled linear cavities (empty slits) can have
a width of no more than 3 nm, while the width of sta-
ble open two-layer and three-layer cavities is practically
unlimited. Note that if the cavity in the substrate was
pre-filled with something before covering, for example,
with water, then the size of such a cavity is unlimited.
Here, the molecules filling the cavity will prevent its col-
lapse.

and (b) closed slit in a multilayer crystal with width Lz =
24.8 nm (Ny = 100, chain period a = 2az).

IV. SLITS INSIDE A MULTILAYER CRYSTAL

To model slits inside a multilayer crystal, consider a
system of K = 100 chains of N = 200 beads with periodic
boundary conditions along both axes. For definiteness,
we will henceforth use the chain model with discreteness
a= 2.

Let us remove Ng beads from K, = 1, 2 neighbor-
ing chains, thereby creating a slit in the crystal of size
Ly, = (Ng+1)ax Lz = Kgho. To find the stationary state
of the slit, we solve the problem of minimizing the system
energy (8). Numerical solution of the problem showed
that a single-layer slit in the crystal can be opened only
for Ng < 11 —see Fig. 5. Thus, the width of an open
single-layer slit is always less than 2.95 nm, which coin-
cides with the estimate obtained in the previous section.

The solution of problem (8) showed that the open state
of a two-layer slit is stable for any length (here the critical
value L, = co). For Ng > 30 (for Lz > L. = 31a =
7.61 nm) there also exists a closed stationary state of
the slit, in which its upper and lower surfaces adhere to
each other — see Fig. 6. The dependence of the energy
difference of these stationary slit states AE = E,,—E, on
its width L, = (N, + 1)a is shown in Fig. 7. The energy
difference increases almost linearly with increasing slit
width. For Lz < Lo = 12.77 nm the open slit state is
energetically more favorable (Ey < E.), while for Ly, >
Lo the ground state becomes the closed one (E, > E.).

V. INFLUENCE OF THERMAL OSCILLATIONS

To check the stability of the stationary slit states, we
have performed molecular dynamics simulation at tem-
perature T < 930 K. To simulate thermal oscillations of

(kp is Boltzmann’s constant, T is the thermostat tem-

In our simulation, we use periodic boundary conditions
with a fixed cell size. Therefore, for correct simulation,
it is necessary to account for the thermal expansion of
the system along the z-axis upon heating when setting
the initial cell sizes (compression along the z-axis can be
neglected). To study the change in the distance between
neighboring graphene layers h(T), let us first consider a
system of A = 80 chains of N = 200 beads. Take periodic
boundary conditions along the z-axis with period Na,
and along the z-axis — free boundary conditions. As the
initial condition for the system of equations of motion
(9), take the stationary state of the system of K parallel
chains

ically integrated using the Verlet method [27] with in-
tegration step At = 1 fs. After equilibrium with the

tral chains h was calculated.

Numerical simulation showed that thermal oscillations
lead to an increase in the distance between neighboring
chains, described with high accuracy by the formula

R(T) = ho + orT + aT”, (10)

where hg = 3.3576 A, a1 = 3.0 x 1074 A/K, ag = 7.3 x
10-8 A/K? — see Fig. 8.

To simulate the influence of thermal oscillations on the
slit shape, let us consider a system of K = 100 parallel
chains, located at distance h(T) from each other. Each
chain consists of N = 200, 400, 800 beads. Along the
x-axis we used periodic boundary conditions with period
Na, and along the z-axis (by index k) — periodic bound-
ary conditions with period Kh(T).

Since single-layer slits are unstable when width L >
3 nm, we will consider next more interesing case of slits
with bigger height.

To create a two-layer slit of width L = (N, + 1)a, let
us remove Ny, beads from two neighboring chains.

Numerical integration of the system of equations of
motion (9) showed that a slit with width L < Lo =
15 nm (N, < 60) always remains in the open state for
all temperature values. Wider slits at high temperatures
will transition to the closed state. For example, for Ng =
50 the planar slit remained open at T < 930 K during
he entire simulation time t = 5 ns. For Ny = 60 the
it remains open at T’ < 600 K (at higher temperatures
he slit periodically transitions from the open state to
he closed state and back). For N, = 70, 80, 100 and
00 (L = 17.4, 19.9, 24.8 and 49.4 nm) the slit remains
en at temperature T’ < T, = 510, 630, 510 and 420 K,
espectively. Here, for T > T, the slit transitions to the
osed state and thereafter remains in it — see Fig. 9.

A three-layer slit (Ky = 3) is always stable against
thermal oscillations. For example, at any temperature
T < 930 K it always remains in the open state.

VI. ALL-ATOM SIMULATION

It is natural to compare the predictions of the two-
dimensional graphene model with a more detailed three-
dimensional atomic model, where an individual particle
corresponds to a carbon atom, not a strip of atoms of
width da. We assume that hydrogen atoms are attached
to the carbon atoms at the free edges of the graphene
sheet. This CH group will be treated as one (unified)
atom of mass 13mp.

As dis d in Section I, the model described above
with pairwise Lennard-Jones interactions of atoms (LJ-
model) underestimates pinning energy. Therefore, let us
also consider a force field (KC-model), in which the pin-
ning energy of graphene sheets agrees with the results
from DFT [23].
nearby atoms is determined by the REBO potential [30],
and non-valent interactions of atoms from different layers
are described by the Kolmogorov-Crespi potential [25].
The potential energy of the system was supplemented
by a term accounting for interaction with the substrate
(12). Energy minimization calculations for this model
were performed in the LAMMPS package [31].

Let us take as the multilayer substrate a nanorib-
oon of K, = 5 layers, where the ”zigzag” direction
coincides with the z-axis, and the “armchair” direc-
ion coincides with the y-axis. Consider nanoribbons
of size Ly = 2Nzaz X Ly = 3Nyrc, where Nz = 200,
N 5. Each layer of such a nanoribbon will consist
of N, = 4N,Ny, = 4000 carbon atoms. When modeling
the substrate, we used periodic boundary conditions with
periods along the x and y axes of 2N,a, = 49.12 nm and
3Nyre = 2.127 nm.

To create a slit from the top K, = 1, 2, 3 nanoribbons,
let us remove N, x 4N, atoms in their center, thereby cre-
ating a transverse cavity of width L = (N, + 1)az — see
Figs. 10 and 11. Then we covered the substrate with the

but shorter length (2N —1)a, with the number of trans-
verse unit cells N = 160. Here, we used free boundary
conditions along the x-axis, and periodic boundary condi-
tions along the y-axis. This three-dimensional molecular
ructure will correspond to the two-dimensional multi-
layer structure considered in Section III.

Numerical solution of problem (14) showed that for

always exists a maximum possible slit width L,, for which
a stable stationary state with an open slit exists (in this
state the covering sheet does not touch the slit bottom)
— see Fig. 10 a, c and 11 a, c. For greater width, only a
closed stationary state of the slit is possible, where the
covering sheet closely adheres to the slit bottom — see
Fig. 10 b, dand 11 b, d. The closed stationary state exis
only for slits with width L > L., where the critical slit

stationary state of the slit exists, for L € (L.,L.) two
stationary states exist simultaneously (open and closed),
and for L > L, only the closed state exists for the slit.
The open stationary state is energetically more favorable
only for slit width L < Lo, where the value Lo € (Le, Lo).
Characteristic slit width values L., Lo and L, are given
in Table III.

As can be seen from Figure 4, the three-dimensional
LJ-model agrees well with the two-dimensional chain
model (d = 1), and the KC-model agrees with the same
model for d = 2.219. The values of the maximum slit
width in the KC-model, as expected, slightly exceed the
estimates from the LJ-model. Differences in the pinning
energy of the two three-dimensional models also affect the
deformation changes of the upper graphene sheet upon
slit collapse. For example, in the KC-model with stronger
pinning, the collapse of a single-layer slit leads to a shift
of the edges of the upper layer relative to the middle lay-

VII. CONCLUSION

In this work, the previously proposed two-dimensional
chain model of multilayer graphene sheets [17] was re-
fined. By increasing the chain period by a factor of
d = 2.129 and rescaling the interaction constants, the
mechanical properties and cohesion energy of graphene
sheets were preserved, and the pinning energy was rec-
onciled with DFT values [23].

Using the two-dimensional coarse-grained chain model,
the formation of planar slits in multilayer graphite crys-
tals was simulated. It was shown that when covering
a linear cavity on the flat surface of a graphite crystal
with a multilayer graphene sheet, an open (unfilled slit)
can form only if the cavity width does not exceed a crit-
ical value Ly. For greater cavity width (for L > Lz),
the graphene sheet, due to bending and edge shifting,
completely adheres to its bottom, forming a closed (col-
lapsed) slit state. A closed state is only possible for slit
widths exceeding a threshold value L, < Lo. Thus, for
