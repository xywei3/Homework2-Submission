Abstract

Single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) exhibit remarkable optical and electrical properties
making them one of the most promising materials for next generation electronic and optoelectronic
devices. Their electronic properties strongly depend on their chirality, i., their structural
configuration, as well as on the presence and nature of atomic defects. Currently, the lack of versatile
and efficient structural characterization techniques limits SWCNT applications. Here, we report how
four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) can address critical
challenges in SWCNT structural analysis. Using modern fast pixelated electron detectors, we were
able to acquire rapidly a large number of low noise electron diffraction patterns of SWCNTs. The
resulting 4D-STEM data allow to precisely determine the local chirality of multiple nanotubes at
once, with limited electron dose (down to 1.7510? e-/A?) and nanometric spatial resolution (down
to 3.1 nm). We also show how this approach enables to track the chirality along a single nanotube,
while giving access to the strain distribution. Then, we report how 4D-STEM data enable to
reconstruct high-resolution images with electron ptychography. With this second approach, structural
information can be obtained with atomic scale spatial resolution allowing atomic defect imaging.
Finally, we investigate how multi-slice electron ptychography could provide even further insight on

nanotube defect structures thanks to its close to 3D imaging capabilities at atomic resolution.
1. Introduction

Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) exhibit remarkable electronic properties (high
mobility, small capacitance) and have a wide range of current and potential applications in electronics
[1,2], optoelectronics and photonics [3-5], bioimaging [6,7] and more. The electronic structure of
SWCNTs is governed by its atomic arrangement imposed by the tubular form, enabling tunable optic
and electronic properties. In particular, chirality is a unique structural parameter of SWCNTs playing
a decisive role in the determination of their structure-dependent electronic properties. The atomic
structure of SWCNT can be described as graphene sheets rolled into cylindrical form. Since the sheet
can be rolled in countless ways, they exhibit a diverse range of helical structures. The helical
configuration of a SWCNT (chirality) is defined by its chiral indices which are expressed by two
integers (n,m). They set the nanotube chiral vector C, = na, + maz, with a, and a, being the unit
vectors of the graphene honeycomb lattice and |C;,| being the perimeter of the tube. A SWCNT is
metallic when n — m = 31, with / an integer, whereas semiconducting whenn — m = 31 + 1,
with the bandgap, in a first approximation, scaling with the inverse of the tube diameter [8]. The
performance of SWCNT-based devices thus fundamentally depends on the ability to control their
chirality.

For this purpose, significant efforts have been devoted to the development of both chiral-
selective growth and effective post-growth sorting methods for large-scale applications. Today, the
best candidate to achieve chiral-selective growth is the catalytic chemical vapor deposition (C-CVD)
method [9,10]. It is capable of reaching 97% chiral purity [11] and even 99.9% semiconducting purity
when combined with electro-renucleation [12]. However, this is still far from the chiral purity that
would be required for modern transistor applications: > 99.9999 % of semiconducting tubes [1]. Most
of the time, SWCNT-based devices require chirality-pure nanotubes which involve an additional
sorting step after the growth [6,10]. In addition, recent studies showed that chirality mutations, i.e.
variations of chiral indices along an individual nanotube, arise during nanotube growth, or can be
induced afterwards [13-15]. These mutations can be engineered, opening new possibilities for
nanotube electronics and nanoscale quantum devices [16]. However, the origins of chiral selectivity
and chirality mutations as well as the mechanism underlaying the formation of the associated atomic
defects remain controversial. As demonstrated in graphene, growth related atomic defects such as
grain boundaries are expected to strongly influence the optical, chemical, and electronic properties of

SWCNTs. In graphene, the detailed structures and formation mechanisms of such defects are
relatively well understood, supported by numerous reliable experimental investigations and
associated theoretical studies [17]. In contrast, the understanding of the structure and formation
mechanism of intramolecular junctions, atomic defects formed between regions with two different
chiralities along a SWCNT, is still mostly theoretical [18-20]. Only a few studies provided reliable
characterization of their structure [21] and some results remain debatable [14]. This is due to the
challenges associated with structural characterization of SWCNTs, arising from their peculiar
structure: a high aspect ratio with ~1 nm diameter, lengths often exceeding a tenth of a micron, and a
three-dimensional tubular structure. Therefore, robust analytical techniques capable of precisely
determining local chirality and the structure of associated atomic defects in individual SWCNTs are
still necessary to gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental growth mechanisms in C-CVD and
further to achieve highly controlled electronic properties of SWCNTs, and which are crucial for next-

generation carbon nanotube applications [10,16].

The most common chirality assignment techniques, such as Resonant Raman Spectroscopy
(RRS), Photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and Rayleigh Scattering Spectroscopy (RSS), are non-
destructive, and allows rapid probing of a large number of nanotubes which enables efficient
statistical analysis [10]. However, these methods are prone to artifacts and intrinsic biases, leading to
errors in chiral index measurements or even the non-detection of certain chiralities [10,22—24]. To
ensure robust chirality determination, optical methods often need to be combined. Furthermore, their
spatial resolution is far above the nanometer scale, preventing the separate analysis of adjacent tubes

or the high-resolution tracking of chirality mutations.

One of the best alternatives to optical techniques is Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM).
To resolve the helical structure of nanotubes, researchers first used Nano Beam Electron Diffraction
(NBED) [25], which is now a standard experiment for TEM equipment. Early works showed that
there is an analytical solution to describe the structure factor of a (n, m) SWCNT, and therefore its
diffraction pattern [26]. This allowed Jiang et al. to develop, a method for unambiguous chirality
determination from these patterns, the “intrinsic layer-line spacing” (ILLS) [27], which is still in use
today [28]. While this method is robust to assign the global chiral indices, it can only be applied to
isolated and suspended SWCNTs, which requires dedicated sample preparation. Due to the small
scattering power of SWCNTs, NBED requires large electron doses, typically between 10° to 10° e”
.A” [29,30], to reach sufficient counts or Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). Most of the time, this leads to
a long exposure time when recording diffraction patterns, from a few seconds to more than 10 [30-

32], which limits the possibility to perform many acquisitions in a row. Furthermore, a single

3
diffraction pattern only contains reciprocal space information, so local structural changes along a tube
cannot be identified. Finally, due to the relatively large diameter of the electron beam (tens of nm
[26]), it can only be applied to isolated nanotubes. Later, the advent of Aberration-Corrected TEM
(AC-TEM) has enabled the use of direct imaging for chirality determination. Chiral indices can be
measured from High-Resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images, either by analyzing the image Fourier
transform [33] or directly from the moiré patterns appearing in the real space image using deep
learning algorithms [34]. Furthermore, atomically resolved images offer the opportunity to study
atomic defects, although, interpretation of HR-TEM images of SWCNTs heavily relies on simulation
to resolve the defect’s structure [35]. While this method presents multiple advantages compare to
NBED,, it is rarely applicable to free-standing nanotubes which tend to vibrate under electron beam
irradiation. A workaround consists in transferring SWCNT ona graphene layer to act as a low contrast
mechanical support [33,36] but this additional step complicates the sample preparation and images

are harder to interpret.

Here, we present two complementary approaches based on 4-Dimensional Scanning TEM (4D-
STEM), to overcome the current limitations in chirality determination with TEM. 4D-STEM is a
powerful technique that records a diffraction pattern at each probe position during a STEM scan,
resulting in a dataset with both real and reciprocal space information [37]. In the first implementation,
a small convergence angle is used, which enables quantitative analysis of diffracted intensities to
extract chirality maps of SWCNTs. This NBED-like approach provides the best sensitivity to chirality
while improving the spatial resolution compared to standard NBED and introduces an error metric to
assess the measurement quality. This type of 4D-STEM dataset also contains information about the
strain field in the material. In this work, we apply this 4D-STEM approach to map strain, specifically
the radial strain component, since the diameter of SWCNTs directly influences their electronic and

optical properties [8].

Secondly, a large convergence angle is used to improve spatial resolution. This high-resolution
4D-STEM configuration gives access to advanced computational image reconstruction methods, in
particular electron ptychography. This technique reconstructs the complex transmission function of
the sample and provides phase contrast imaging with sub-angstrom resolution [38,39], enabling the
visualization of individual carbon atoms and fine structural details in SWCNTs [40-42]. Even with
outstanding spatial resolution, resolving the structure of defects in SWCNTs remains challenging due
to the projected moiré patterns intrinsic to tubular structures. To address this issue, we explore multi-

slice electron ptychography, a more advanced phase retrieval technique that offers not only higher

4
spatial resolution than conventional (single-slice) ptychography but also enables three-dimensional
imaging through numerical depth sectioning [43-45]. Finally, we discuss its potential for directly

visualizing atomic defects in SWCNTs.

2. Methods

2.1. Sample preparation

The nanotubes were synthesized by CCVD on homemade TEM grids. The latter were fabricated
by optical lithography and plasma etching (RIE) from multiframe arrays purchased from Oxford
Instruments. The catalyst (1 A cobalt) was deposited on one half of the grids by vacuum thermal
evaporation. The grids were heat-treated in air, and then introduced into the CVD reactor airlock.
After purging the reactor to remove oxygen and water, the furnace was heated to 850 °C. After a 5-
minute temperature stabilization, the sample was rapidly introduced into the heated zone and the
synthesis continued for 30 minutes. Ethanol was used as the carbon precursor, carried by a flow of
argon (66.6 sccm) through a bubbler maintained at 0 °C. The total flow was supplemented by another
line of argon at 832.7 sccm and dihydrogen at 189.0 sccm. After 30 minutes, the samples were quickly

removed from the heating zone.

2.2. Nanotube molecular dynamic simulations

To evaluate the performance of electron ptychography, artificial 4D-STEM datasets were
generated from defective nanotube structures. Realistic atomic configurations were obtained through
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations computed with the LAMMPS package [46]. These MD
simulations are based on the Tersoff potential [47] known to be a reliable description of carbonaceous
structures [48,49]. The simulations start off at 6500 K to induce the formation of topological defects.
The system is then rapidly cooled down to room temperature. The details of the simulation protocol
are published elsewhere [34]. Once equilibrium is reached, 16 snapshots at 300 K are extracted as

structural models for the 4D-STEM simulations (see next section).

2.3. 4D-STEM experiments and simulations
4D-STEM experiments were performed on a Titan Ultimate microscope equipped with an X-
FEG gun and 2 spherical aberration correctors for probe and image modes. The incident electron

beam energy was set at 80 keV to prevent the tubes from being damaged. For chirality and strain

mapping, the convergence semi-angle of the beam (a) was set at 0.8 + 0.05 mrad (small angle
configuration) and the real space pixel size was set at 1.04 nm with an exposure time of 50 ms per

pixel. For the electron ptychography experiment, the convergence semi-angle of the beam was set at
26.1 + 0.05 mrad (large angle configuration) and the exposure time per scan position was 2 ms. The
real space pixel size was 0.76 A and the reciprocal space pixel size was 0.0152 A”!. The electron dose
per area was approximately 10° eA. The STEM probe was in-focus to directly compare the
reconstruction with the Annular Dark Field (ADF) image. All datasets were recorded on a Medipix3
camera composed of 256x256 pixels. This hybrid pixel direct electron detector offers several
advantages, including low noise and a large dynamic range. This wide range eliminates the need for
a beam stop and prevents saturation near the direct beam. It is also crucial for electron ptychography,

where both strong and weak signals must be captured simultaneously.

Diffraction pattern and 4D-STEM dataset simulations were carried out with the abTEM
package [50] within the multi-slice formalism. To simulate small convergence angle experiments,
parameters were set at 0.142 A for the lateral real space sampling, with a slice thickness of 1.42 A.
For the large convergence angles, parameters were set at 0.08875 A for the lateral real space sampling,
with a slice thickness of 0.71 A. To emulate thermal vibrations at room temperature during the
experiment, we use the frozen phonon approximation using 16 the molecular dynamics snapshots as
input structures (only for large convergence angles). Simulations were carried out to emulate different
experimental conditions. A first one to match our experimental conditions, meaning: 80 kV with a
convergence angle of 26.1 mrad considering an energy spread of 1.2 eV, typical of a X-FEG gun. A
second one to represent a more coherent cold-FEG (CFEG) gun with an energy spread of 0.4 eV at
200 kV with the same convergence angle. For both large convergence angle simulations, a focal
spread 5 was introduced to consider the energy spread of the electron beam and the chromatic

aberration of the microscope. 5 values were computed using the formula

AE
E’

where C, is the chromatic aberration, EF and AE are the energy and energy spread of the electron

6=C, (1)

beam, respectively. We used 7 probe wave functions using the weighted incoherent integral method
to emulate the focal spread [51]. Then, Poisson noise was added to the final 4D datasets corresponding
to an electron dose per area of 10° eA’. For all configurations, we used the finite projection

approximation for the calculation of the electrostatic potential in each slice.

2.4. Chirality determination

2.4.1. Intrinsic layer-line spacing method
To measure the chirality from small convergence angle diffraction pattern, we used the ILLS

method described in [27]. We briefly summarize the method in what follows but first we need to
introduce the specificities of the electron diffraction pattern of a SWCNT. When an electron probe
with a small convergence angle is transmitted through a nanotube, as represented in Figure 1(a), the
resulting diffraction pattern is composed of diffraction spots arranged in a set of lines which originate
from the helical symmetry of the nanotube and are characteristic of its chirality. Figure 1(b), shows
a typical experimental diffraction pattern of a chiral tube (m > 0 and n # m). The most intense line
at the center is the equatorial line (Lo), then there are three 1‘‘-order lines, (L,,L , L3), and finally

three 2"“-order lines, (L4, Ls, L¢). They are all oriented along the tube radial direction, k,.

Bessel function, red line. (d) kg intensity profiles integrated over k, considering only the 1* and 2" order
lines, blue and orange lines, respectively, and refined peaks positions marked by black dashed lines.

The ILLS method comprises two steps: first, the tube diameter, dg, is measured by fitting the
Lo intensity profile, and then, the tube geometry is determined by measuring the spacing between
each non-equatorial layer-line, L;, and Ly. By combining all this information, it becomes possible to
determine the nanotube’s chiral indices while simultaneously correcting the tilt angle, 6, between the
tube axis and the direction perpendicular to the electron beam propagation direction [27] (see Figure

1(a)), without relying on diffraction calibration.
Let us start by measuring the tube diameter by extracting and fitting the intensity profile of the
equatorial line along k,: I,,(k,). Within the framework of kinematical diffraction theory, we can
show that I fe (k,.) is proportional to the squared modulus of a Bessel function [26,27], such as:

I, (k,) = Clo (atdok,)|?, (2)
where C is a strictly positive real constant, dy is the diameter of the observed tube and Jo is the 0-
order Bessel function (see Eq. (A2) in Appendix for the definition of Jy). The profile extracted from
Figure 1(b) is plotted in Figure 1(c) (blue squares connected by a blue line) with its corresponding
fit (red line). Note that the distances between the roots of Jo(mdok,.), i.e., distances between the

I, (k,) minima, are all equal to gy = = [27]. Therefore, the refined dy value is reliable as long as
0

the positions of the maxima and minima of the experimental data and fitted function are the same,
even if there is a large amplitude discrepancy between the two. In previous studies, the /,, fitting
procedure was performed using an approximation of the 0'"-order Bessel function [27,52]. Here, we
implemented a non-linear least square fitting procedure using the SciPy software [53], which includes
direct computation of Bessel functions without approximations [54]. Because small variations in do
induce large changes in J, periodicity and amplitude, we chose to manually pass a first guess for C

and dp values prior to the fitting process to improve its robustness.

Then we measure the layer-line spacings, G;,(i = 1,2,...,6), which are define as the
reciprocal space distances between L; and Lo, along the tube axial direction kg. This is rather
straightforward as it consists in getting the overall intensity profile along the tube axial direction kg,
by integrating the diffracted intensity over k, and measuring the Kg coordinates of the peaks. Figure
1(d), shows the integrated intensity profiles for the 1% and 2™ order lines, (blue and orange line
respectively). They are composed of a series of peaks, each one corresponding to one layer-line. The
black dashed lines represent the peak positions refined using the SciPy toolkits. Figure 1(d) lines

with a positive k, component are labelled L; and lines with a negative one are labelled L;.

G, contain information about the = ratio [26] but they depend on the tilt angle, 8. To determine

the absolute values of chiral indices, we need to compute the unit less intrinsic layer-line spacings

define as:

fi = dG, = 3)
Each €; are defined as a linear combination of the chiral indices (see Appendix). However, the
quantities measured experimentally, zh , also depend on f. They are related to the intrinsic values

following the relation:
cosB = e (4)

To determine the chirality of the tube, we need to solve for 3 unknowns: n, m and B. To do so, we
have 12 available equations: 6 for all ¢; (Eqs. (A3)), and 6 times the cos f relation (Eq. (4)). After
solving this system, we obtain real values for the chiral indices: n? and m¥. The actual chiral indices
are obtained by recovering only the integer part of the measured values, such as:

n= |n8 |, m= |m*|, (5)
where |:] is the floor function. Some additional corrections are required for large 8 values and can be
found in [27]. In addition of providing robust chirality measurement, this method does not require
any prior calibration of the reciprocal space pixel size because ¢; are unitless. In the following, we
will also frequently use calibrated data to evaluate the accuracy of the method for measuring

diameters.

2.4.2. Relative and absolute error estimation

The hybrid pixelated detector used in this study only contains a few numbers of pixels compare
to conventional CMOS or CCD cameras. As a result, a one-pixel error in the line position
measurement can significantly alter the chirality determination. Therefore, it is crucial to estimate the
potential errors in the chirality measurement. These can be directly estimated by the fitting procedure
itself using the covariance matrix. A standard deviation error, o, for each parameter is obtained by
taking the square root of the diagonal elements of this matrix. Therefore, when fitting the /, , intensity
profile, a 3¢g, confidence interval can be directly recovered. However, in the case of layer-line
spacings, the peak position refinement has to be done with a limited number of pixels (between 3 to
11 pixels per peak, depending on the dataset). This reduced number of data points results in
inaccuracies in the estimation of the covariance matrix. Fortunately, the errors in the layer-line

spacings can be assessed using an alternative method.

As detailed in the previous section, multiple ze can be combined to determine the tilt-affected
chiral indices: n? and m*. Here, we chose to measure the indices with three different layer-line
spacing combinations: a first one by combing a and Ee , a second one by combing ee and Ee anda

last one by combing €: 4 and € : (see Eqs. (A3) in Appendix). To reduce possible errors, the 3 (n8 »mé )

9
values are averaged to give the final (n,m) results. Then, the intrinsic €; are computed which allows

to calculate six different values for the tilt angle, using Eq. (4) and rearranging such as

Bi = cos™* (5) (6)

Once again, the final 6 value is obtained by averaging all six 8; values. The only piece of information
not used for chirality determination is Eg . Therefore, it can be used to estimate the residual error. We

can compute a theoretical value for ef using the relation
n& — mB
V3n

(see Eqs. (A3) in Appendix). Absolute and relative errors can be calculated by comparing the

a= (7)

measured e with the right term in Eq. (7). The relative error, €,.¢), is expressed as

v3neF —n? +mP
nB — mB

(8)

Erel =

Because Ca are unitless, they are not well-suited for estimating absolute errors, are not well-suited
for estimating absolute errors, especially when expressing them as a number of pixels on the detector

in reciprocal space. To do so, it is more convenient to scale the absolute error by re which allows it
0

to be represented in the same units as the layer-line spacing D;. By subtracting the two terms in Eq.

(7) and using Eq. (3), we obtain the following for the absolute error, €g,,, expressed in reciprocal
pixel scale:

V3né? — nb +m

Eabs = 3nd, do .

Note that for armchair and zigzag tubes, this error cannot be estimated because there are not enough

(9)

layer-lines to get information redundancy. However, these structural configurations can be easily
identified due to their characteristic diffraction signature, and chirality assignment errors arise only

from uncertainties in diameter measurement.

2.5. Chirality mapping
To generate a chirality map, an ADF image of the captured area is reconstructed from the 4D-
STEM dataset using a virtual detector. In the ADF image shown in the top of Figure 2(a), we see a
typical nanotube bundle separation with its characteristic Y-shape [55-57], composed of two
SWCNTs, NTI (left) and NT2 (right). There are also regions with a brighter contrast in this image
highlighted by the yellow arrows. They correspond to residual contaminants (mostly carbon) which

is common in CVD grown SWCNTs [22,58,59]. To determine the chirality of each nanotube, close

10
to the junction, we segment the ADF image to isolate regions of interest (ROD, i.e., individual tube
without contamination. Then, we extract the diffraction corresponding to the ROI of NTI (blue area
in Figure 2(a)), and NT2 (red area in Figure 2(a)). These “sub-datasets” are represented at the bottom
of Figure 2(a), for NT1 (left) and NT2 (right).

Figure 2 - 4D-STEM chirality mapping procedure. (a) Virtual ADF image extracted from a 4D-STEM dataset
(top), with contaminated areas indicated by the yellow arrows; in the bottom left, stack of diffraction patterns
extracted from the area attributed to NT1 (blue area in top) and in the bottom right, stack of diffraction patterns
extracted from the area attributed to NT2 (red area in top). (b) and (c) processed PACBEDs associated to NT1
and NT2, respectively. (d) and (e) schematics of the structures determined by the ILLS method for NT1 and
NT2, respectively. All PACBEDs are shown without the direct beam and with a square root intensity scale.

To increase the SNR, we can average all patterns in each sub-dataset, resulting in Position
Averaged Convergent Beam Electron Diffraction (PACBED) patterns. For a robust averaging
procedure, the sub-dataset needs to be descan corrected. When the electron beam is scanned across
the sample, it may drift away from the optical axis, leading to an apparent shift of the diffraction
patterns on the detector. This is usually compensated for by the descan coils, but some residual drift
may still be present and can be numerically corrected by shifting the diffraction pattern images. To
do so, we simply measure the position offset of the direct beam with template matching and cross-
correlation and realign all diffraction patterns [60]. In addition, we need to compensate for the

nanotube curvature. Indeed, nanotubes often curve within the field of view, i.e., the plane

11
perpendicular to the electron beam propagation direction. It results in an apparent rotation of the
patterns relative to each other. Curvature compensation is performed by measuring the orientation of
the equatorial line, which is always aligned with the tube radial axis and clearly visible in each
individual pattern (bottom of Figure 2(a)). Note that this requires to first compute a polar transform
of the pattern. Then, all images are rotated to align all equatorial lines and all patterns are summed.
Finally, we apply a numerical mask on the direct beam and we remove the background intensity using

the SNIP algorithm [61].

The resulting pre-processed diffraction pattern are shown in Figure 2(b) and Figure 2(c), for
NT1 and NT2, respectively. They have been rotated so the tube radial direction in reciprocal space,
k,, and axial direction, kg, are horizontal and vertical, respectively. In Figure 2(c) (which is the same
as Figure 1b), we can see six layer-lines which means NT2 is a chiral tube. However, Figure 2(b)

does not contain as many layer-lines and some are superimposed. This is the typical pattern of an

armchair tube where n = m. In this particular case, we have G, 0, Gz G3 Gy Gs and

Ge = 2G). Note that there is another particular case for zigzag tubes when m = 0, which leads to
Gy G2, G3 2G,,G, =OandGs = Gg = 3G,. The ILLS method is perfectly capable of dealing
with these achiral cases [27]. When applied to the PACBEDs in Figure 2, it gives a chirality of
(23,23) for NT1 and (15,12) for NT2. Simulated diffraction patterns can be found in the

supplementary section | (Figure S1) for comparison. The corresponding ideal tube structures are

represented in Figure 2(d) and Figure 2(e), for NT1 and NT2, respectively.

Now, the local chirality can be mapped along an individual tube or even multiple tubes, simply
by adjusting the size and the location of ROIs and analyzing many PACBEDs or even single

diffraction patterns.

2.6. Radial strain mapping

Strain in carbon nanotubes is known to modify their electronic structure. More interestingly,
the radial strain component directly modifies their diameter and affects the nanotube bandgap [8,62].
Most of the time, radial strain relaxes in one direction, leading to an elliptical deformation of the tube
[63,64]. When observing the projected diameter of a radially strained SWCNT, it can appear larger
or smaller than the unstrained diameter, depending on the projection direction. Therefore, mapping
these local projected diameter variations directly provides a radial strain map along the tube.
Assuming there is an unstrained reference section with projected diameter d,.¢ on the nanotube, the

radial strain component at any location with a projected strained diameter d, is defined as:

12
d, — dyer

=
" dyer

(10)

With this definition, positive strain values correspond to larger projected diameters, i.e., projections
closer to the ellipse’s major axis, whereas negative strain values correspond to smaller projected
diameters, i.e., projections closer to the minor axis. As discussed in section 2.4, fitting the equatorial
line profile allows us to measure diameters. More precisely, it is the tube’s diameter projected along
the axis perpendicular to the electron beam propagation direction. By applying this fitting procedure
at multiple locations along the same tube, we obtain a spatial map of local projected diameter
variations. Note that the manual first guess discussed in section 2.4, needs to be passed only once to
efficiently measure diameter variations along a single SWCNT. This, in turn, provides the necessary

information to construct a radial strain map for an individual nanotube.

Furthermore, the measured radial strain values could be absolute or relative. Determining the
absolute radial strain for a specific chirality would require a perfectly calibrated diffraction space and
measuring the diameter of an ideal, unstrained nanotube. However, we cannot say for certain that
such a nanotube is present in our sample. Instead, we analyze only relative radial strain by selecting
a minimally strained reference area and comparing other regions to it. This area is chosen in an
uncurved nanotube region and free from residual contamination, providing the closest approximation
to an ideal unstrained reference. Although this does not guarantee that the zero radial strain reference
corresponds to a perfectly circular tube, it is sufficient to analyze strain variations along the tube and

identify the most strained regions.

2.7. Electron ptychography reconstruction

To generate high-resolution images of carbon nanotubes, we use electron ptychography. It is
an advanced phase retrieval technique that reconstructs high-resolution images by analyzing
overlapping diffraction patterns collected during a 4D-STEM experiment [65,66]. Unlike
conventional imaging methods, ptychography can overcome lens aberrations and extend the
resolution beyond the limits of traditional electron optics [38,43,67]. For single-walled carbon
nanotubes (SWCNTs), electron ptychography is particularly valuable due to its ability to retrieve
high-contrast phase images with sub-angstrom resolution, making it possible to visualize atomic-scale
features with minimal electron dose [41].

In this study, simulated and experimental 4D-STEM datasets were processed with the
py4DSTEM package [60] to compute ptychographic images. The dataset was first binned down to

128x128 pixels in diffraction space and then reconstructions were carried out using an iterative

13
method based on the stochastic gradient-descent algorithm [68]. We used the mixed-state multi-slice
ptychography formalism to account for both the probe decoherence, and the tube diameter (thickness
in the beam propagation direction). We used three different probe modes and two slices with a
thickness of 3 nm. The reconstructions were additionally constrained using filters both in real and

Fourier space to avoid high-frequency artifacts.

3.1. Chirality mapping
BDL. Chirality determination
In this section, we discuss the efficiency of the proposed method to determine and map local
chiralities in SWCNTs. As shown in Figure 2, the chirality mapping procedure allows to determine
the chirality of nearby tubes. Here, the chirality of NT was measured as (23,23) with B = 4.6°, NT2
was (15,12) with 6 = 10.1°. Prior to the experiment, the diffraction pixel size was calibrated at 0.0814
nm! using a reference silicon sample. Even though calibration is not mandatory for chirality

determination with the ILLS method, it allows us to measure the tube diameters directly from the

diffraction patterns. We found a diameter of 31.33 + 0.17 A for NT1, while the theoretical diameter

for a (23,23) SWCNT is 31.19 A. Note that the uncertainty in diameter measurement is given with a

30g, confidence interval (see section 2.4.2). For NT2, the measured diameter is 18.19 + 0.11 A,

compared to the theoretical diameter of 18.34 A for a (15,12) SWCNT.

The relative error in the recalculation of ef for NT2 was 4.4 %, corresponding to an absolute
error of 0.16 pixels on the L, position. As mentioned in section 2.4.2, the error cannot be estimated
in the case of NTI! (armchair tube) but the measured diameter is in good agreement with the

theoretical value of a (23,23) tube.

Studying this system so close to the bundle separation point would not be possible during a
conventional electron diffraction experiment because of the large diameter of the electron beam.
Thanks to the capabilities of 4D-STEM, this is now achievable. We now explore the limiting criteria
of this technique, particularly the spatial resolution limit, the minimum electron dose for chirality

determination, and the influence of the probe convergence angle on the results.

3.1.2. Spatial resolution and minimum dose.

e Spatial resolution
The obvious limiting parameter for spatial resolution is the diameter of the electron beam. In
the previous experiment (Figure 2), the convergence angle of the probe was measured to be 0.85
mrad which corresponds to a STEM probe full width at half maximum (FWHM) of approximately
2.5 nm. Therefore, the optimal spatial resolution can only be larger than this value. In this case, this
is sufficient to characterize the tube structure even within the bundle. Figure 3 features the same
dataset as Figure 2, but this time, the dataset is processed to assess both the spatial resolution of the
technique and the minimum electron dose required for chirality identification. Figure 3(a) is the
virtual ADF image where colored pixels show the regions where diffraction patterns were extracted
from. The cyan area contains only two patterns corresponding to NT2 and their sum is shown in
Figure 3(b). The blue, red and green areas contain patterns extracted from the bundle and their
respective sums are shown in Figure 3(c) (from left to right). We avoided the contaminated area on
purpose to investigate only the SWCNT signals. The central red area contains the scattered intensities
coming from both tubes, NT1 and NT2 (Figure 3(c)). On each side, the left blue area produces the
typical pattern of an armchair tube (NT1) while the right green area gives the typical pattern of a
chiral tube (NT2). Therefore, the chirality of both tubes can be determined even within the bundle,
provided that the beam position is sufficiently far from the line where the tubes are in contact. This
minimal distance between adjacent probes to resolved individual tubes in the bundle corresponds to
the spatial resolution of the experiment. Here, because the red area has a width of 3 pixels, we can

assert that the spatial resolution in this case is 3.1 nm.

To confirm this, we performed the ILLS analysis to determine the chirality of each tubes inside
the bundle and compared the results with the previously determined ones. After processing the green
patterns in Figure 3(c), we measured a chirality of (15,12) for NT2, just as expected. For NT1 (blue
pattern in Figure 3(c)), we measure a chirality of (20,20) instead of the expected (23,23) indices. This
is due to a large radial strain component induced by the bundle in NT1, which is not considered by

the ILLS method. We will discuss this aspect later in section 3.2.

Other electron diffraction based techniques such as coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) or
ptychography already reached higher spatial resolutions when studying carbon nanotubes [29,41].
However, this is to our knowledge the highest spatial resolution ever reached to characterize

SWCNTs chirality purely from electron diffraction, i.e., without phase retrieval data processing.

red, and green areas in (a), from left to right. All PACBEDs are shown without the direct beam and with a
square root intensity scale.

e Electron dose

Then, to determine the minimal electron dose required for chirality determination, we can
reduce the number of diffraction patterns within the PACBED and check when the ILLS method fails.
With this configuration, we found that we had to sum at least two patterns to determine the chirality

of NT2. We performed the ILLS method on the cyan pattern shown in Figure 3(b) and measured a

chirality of (15,12), just as expected. The diameter was measured at 18.24 + 0.11 A, so the reduced
electron dose does not affect the confidence interval of the diameter measurement, since Lg maintains
sufficient intensity. However, the relative error on the L, position was 13.9 % (absolute error of 0.59
pixels). Here, the error increases (see section 3.1.1) due to the poor SNR but the chiral indices are
still the expected ones. However, the absolute error being more than half a pixel, this is the absolute
limit we can reach with our experimental setup. In this experiment, the electron dose per area was
estimated at 1.75x10 eA, so within 2 probe positions the minimal total electron dose is 3.8<105 e”
. This lies at the lower end of the typical electron doses used for chirality determination of SWCNTs

by electron diffraction [29,30], so our approach does not allow significant dose reduction. However,

16
thanks to the hybrid pixelated detector, it enables working with higher beam currents and shorter
exposure times (on the order of tens of milliseconds instead of several seconds), making the

acquisition of local chirality maps faster and thus feasible.

3.1.3. Probe convergence angle limitations.

As presented in section 2.4.1, to measure the G; spacings, we measure the peak positions in the
integrated intensity profile shown in Figure 1(d). Intuitively, one might expect that increasing the
probe convergence angle would broaden the peaks. The trivial limitation is that the convergence angle
must remain small enough to prevent peak overlap. To define this limiting criterion, we need to
express the width of the peak corresponding to one layer line L;, as a function of the convergence
angle. Let us formulate the peak intensity profile along kg as:

Krmax
Pi (Ka) = I, 1, (k)dk,, (11)

where 1, Ck) is the L; component of the diffracted intensities and k is the maximum recorded

Tmax
spatial frequency on the detector. I,, is the squared modulus of the complex electron exit wave
component associated to L;, ¥,;. Within the kinematical theory of diffraction and using the weak
phase approximation, Y,; is proportional to the electron probe incident wave function in reciprocal

space, A, also called the aperture function convolved with the L; component of the nanotube structure
factor, F,,, 80

Pi(k) x (A@F,,) UO, (12)
where ® is the convolution operator [69]. If we neglect all phase errors, i.e., residual probe

aberrations!, A(k) is defined as:

_ (LU |kKl Ss ke
AW) = {9 ls ke (13)
with kg = 5 A being the electron wavelength. We can rewrite P,, using Eqs. (11) and (12) as:
Krmax : Krmax 2
P,,(ka) = | |, Ck) | dk, « | |(A@F,,) Uo] dk. (14)
—Krmax ~"rmax

Therefore, the width of the P,, depends on F,, and will increase due to the convolution with the
aperture function. The broadening is directly related to the size of the aperture; specifically, the larger
kq, the wider the peak. After some calculations (see Appendix), we can show that Eq. (14) simplifies

to

' Valid in our case because we use a small condenser aperture (5 ym) recovering only the non-aberrated central
part of the incident probe.

17
4[ka’ —(ka-G)?], Ika - Gil S Ke

P, (k,) « 15
ileal 0, Ika - Gil > ke a

As expected, P,,(k,) reaches its maximum value when k, = Dj, which is proportional to 4k’. Asa

result, we can estimate its FWHM which are the distances between the two roots of the equation

Alka’ — (ka — Gi)?] = 2kq’. (16)
Solving for Eq. (16), we obtain
Ka
kg = Gite (17)
which leads to
FWHM = y2ky. (18)

Finally, to avoid peak overlap, the convergence angle criterion must satisfy the inequality
V2kq < Gi — G;, (19)

G; — G; being the distance between two lines L; and L;.

This criterion can be tested experimentally with close to zigzag, (n,1), or close to armchair,
(n,n — 1), tubes. Figure 4, shows the 4D-STEM data acquired from a close to armchair SWCNT.
The virtual ADF image is presented in Figure 4(a), where brighter areas correspond to carbon
contamination on the tube and the red areas are the regions used for chirality determination. It was
identified as a (14,13) SWCNT with the ILLS method. However, it sits right at the convergence angle
criterion limit of the given experimental configuration, requiring further refinement of the data
processing protocol to reliably determine its chirality, as detailed in the following. In this experiment
the convergence angle was measured to be 0.76 mrad (kg = 0.182 nm). For a (14,13) SWCNT,
G, = G3 — G, = 0.10 nm! and G; — G, = 0.30 nm'!. The convergence angle criterion previously
established gives a minimal resolvable distance between 2 layer-lines of V2kq = 0.257 nm’.
Therefore, lines Ly and L, as well as Lz and L3 are superimposed due to their close spacing. On the
other hand, lines L4 and Ls are separated by a distance greater than V2kq so they should be
distinguishable. A simulated diffraction pattern corresponding to a (14,13) SWCNT and an
experimental PACBED (extracted from the right most red area in Figure 4(a)) are shown in Figure
4(b) and Figure 4(c), respectively. As expected, lines Lo and L, as well as Lz and L3 are
superimposed, while L, and L, are separated in the simulated pattern. In the case of the experimental
data (Figure 4(c)), this is not as clear, even though the L,/L, line intensity is broader than the other

lines.

beam and with a square root intensity scale.

To better assess whether the lines are resolved, we extracted the P,, we intensity profile from the

cyan regions shown in Figure 4(c). These profiles are plotted in Figure 4(d) as blue squares
connected by a blue line. The peak is asymmetric, suggesting that it is composed of multiple
components. To model this, two peaks were used to fit the experimental data, corresponding to Ly
(orange dashed line in Figure 4(d)) and Ls (green dashed line in Figure 4(d)). The total fitted curve,
shown as a red line in Figure 4(d), matches the experimental data well. Although the lines are not
perfectly resolved, their individual contributions can still be extracted through multi-peak fitting. The
reciprocal space resolution appears lower than in the simulated pattern, probably because of
imperfections in the microscope projection system and the detector's modulation transfer function
(MTF). Nevertheless, it remains sufficient to measure the peak positions and determine the chirality.
Note that instead of fitting with the P,, functions in Eq. (15), we found that fitting with multiple
gaussian functions is more robust to compensate for the detector’s MTF. Using the ILLS method
combined with multi-peak fitting, all four red regions were consistently identified as having (14,13)

chiral indices.
Besides chirality, the diffraction patterns also provide information about strain, allowing for

more detailed structural characterization, which is discussed in the next section.

3.2. Radial strain mapping

3.2.1, Results

As presented in section 2.6, multiple diameter values can be extracted from equatorial line
intensity fits at various locations along the tube, and these can be used to generate radial strain maps.
Figure 5 shows the resulting strain maps obtained from the previously presented datasets. The Y-
shape bundle separation strain map is plotted in Figure 5(a), superimposed on the virtual ADF image.
In addition, Figure 5(b) shows the higher resolution HAADF image of the same area. Then, the
individual close to armchair nanotube strain map is plotted in Figure 5(c), also superimposed on its

corresponding virtual ADF image.

radial strain map. (b) Higher resolution STEM-HAADF of the same area as in (a). (c) Virtual ADF image of
the close to armchair tube, with superimposed radial strain map. The reference unstrained areas are indicated
by the yellow arrows.

In the Y-shaped bundle separation map (Figure 5(a)), the upper region—where the tubes are
clearly separated—shows that the nanotubes are mostly unstrained, except for NT1, which exhibits

slight negative strain near a contaminated area in the upper left region of Figure 5(a)-(b). Closer to

20
the separation point, both nanotubes display negative strain, particularly NT 1 at the location indicated
by the upper blue arrow in Figure 5(a). This strain arises because the nanotubes bend near the
separation point, leading to a reduction in projected diameter due to stress relaxation. This buckling
behavior in bent SWCNTs is well established in the literature [70,71]. It offers a valuable case for
assessing the accuracy of the radial strain measurement method by comparing strain values obtained
from diffraction with diameters measured directly in the HAADF image (Figure 5(b)). We find good
agreement between the two approaches: the manually determined real-space strain is -4.33 %, while
the diffraction-based strain is -4.26 %. This level of deformation is fully consistent with the expected

buckling of the nanotube [71].

Within the bundle, both nanotubes exhibit significant strain, with opposite trends in projected
diameter variation. NT2 is positively strained, showing a projected diameter increase of +2.68 %
relative to the reference region, while NT1 is negatively strained with a -8.56 % projected diameter
variation. This opposing behavior suggests that both tube experience elliptical deformation in
opposite directions, NT 1 projecting the minor axis of the ellipse and NT2 the major axis. While van
der Waals forces may be responsible for this effect, a definitive conclusion cannot be drawn due to
the presence of addition carbon contamination in this region, which can also affect the local tube
apparent diameters [63]. Furthermore, the radial strain in NT1 is quite large. Although previous
results show no breaking of the armchair symmetry in the diffraction pattern (see Figure 3(c)), the
observed diameter is much smaller than expected for a (23,23) nanotube. This discrepancy led to a
failure in chirality identification using the ILLS method, which incorrectly assigned a nanotube with
similar symmetry but smaller diameter (see section 3.1.2). In contrast, NT2 is less strained, so in this
case, the ILLS method still correctly identifies the (15,12) chirality. The mean 30g, confidence

interval for the diameter measurement was estimated to be 0.76% here (Figure 5(a)).

For the nanotube close to the armchair configuration shown in Figure 5(c), the radial strain
ranges approximately from —2.4% to 2.1%. Radial strain is primarily observed in contaminated
regions, while cleaner areas remain unstrained. This confirms previous results attributing radial
deformation to the presence of carbon contamination on SWCNTs [63] and it highlights the
importance of nanotube cleanness in maintaining a constant diameter and uniform strain. Such
structural stability is critical for nanotube-based device performance, as both diameter and strain

directly influence the electronic and transport properties of SWCNTs [15,72—74]. The mean 304,

21
confidence interval for the diameter measurement was estimated to be 0.77% in this case (Figure

5(c)).

3.2.1. Probe convergence angle limitations.

The convergence angle also as an impact on radial strain measurements. In the method
presented before (section 2.6), the radial strain mapping procedure considers that the equatorial line
intensity profile is proportional to the squared modulus of Jy (Eq. (2)). In the case of convergent
STEM probe, the diffracted intensities are once again convoluted with the probe aperture function.

Therefore, Eq. (2) must be modified to consider the effect of the probe.
2 2
In(k) = |¥,,) | & |(A@Jo(tedok,)) (KD. (20)

A brute force solution is to directly fit the data with the squared modulus of the convolution scaled
by an amplitude factor. This approach is easy to implement since the probe aperture function can be
directly measured using a reference vacuum diffraction pattern, assuming that we can ignore phase

errors.

Using simulated diffraction patterns and measuring the diameter for a wide range of chiralities
(see supplementary section 2), we show that at 80 kV and for convergence angles a > 1 mrad, the
residual errors in diameter measurements increase with a when fitting is performed using the simple
Bessel function Jy (Eq. (2)). In contrast, the errors remain constant when using the convolution-based
model (Eq. (20)). However, the latter model becomes highly non-linear and difficult to fit robustly to
experimental data with the currently implemented fitting procedure. For a < 1 mrad, both models
yield comparable errors, with Jy even achieving slightly lower residual errors (see supplementary
section 2). Based on these observations, we chose to use Eq. (2) for fitting equatorial line profiles and

to operate with convergence angles below | mrad.

Ideally, the full strain tensor should be determined. However, this requires further investigation
to distinguish the effects of axial strain from those of specimen tilt. While measuring shear strain may
be feasible, additional study is needed to understand its influence on line positions. These

considerations fall outside the scope of the present work.

3.3. Imaging defects with electron ptychography

3.3.1, Results
While the previously presented approach (small convergence angle 4D-STEM) provides lots of

information about SWCNTs’ structural properties, it is still limited by its intrinsic spatial resolution

22
of a few nanometers. This prevents the investigation of atomic scale defects in particular intrinsic
topological defects. To overcome this limitation, one approach is to perform 4D-STEM mapping
using a larger convergence angle, which improves real-space resolution. This enables the use of
electron ptychography to reconstruct phase-contrast images at the atomic scale, allowing direct

visualization of atomic structure and local defects in the nanotube.

Figure 6 presents the high-resolution images obtained from a 4D-STEM dataset acquired on a
defective (37,1) SWCNT. The perfect tube model is shown in Figure 6(a) and Figure 6(b) shows
the virtual ADF image. Then, the phase image of the ptychographic reconstruction is shown in Figure
6(c) with an enlarged view of the defective region shown in Figure 6(d). Finally, the Fourier

transform of the total phase image (Figure 6(c)) is shown in Figure 6(e).

While the Moiré pattern of the tube and defects is barely visible in the ADF image, it appears
clearly in the ptychographic reconstruction. First, the tube chirality can be determined from the phase

image by measuring the tube diameter in real space and the = ratio from the image FFT (Figure 6(e)),

following the method detailed in [33]. Here, we determined the tube chiral indices to be (37,1). The
FFT enables to determine the spatial resolution of the reconstruction, here measured at 1.0 A. Finally,
because the phase is proportional to the electrostatic potential within the sample, the phase image can
be used to analyze the defect structure in the nanotube. It is clearly visible in Figure 6(d) that the
Moiré pattern symmetry breaks revealing the structure of a topological defect at the surface of the

tube. Areas enclosed by yellow dashed circles appear darker than their surroundings, indicating lower

23
potential and suggesting the presence of vacancies. In contrast, areas marked with red dots appear
brighter, corresponding to higher potential and possibly representing additional atoms adsorbed on

the surface, interstitial carbon atoms, or heavier impurity atoms.

3.3.2. Discussion

Using a large convergence angle in 4D-STEM together with electron ptychography provides
improved high-resolution imaging capabilities for studying defects in SWCNTs. Because SWCNTs
only scatters weakly the incident electrons, they could in principle be considered as pure thin phase
objects [29,75], which require only the single slice ptychography formalism. However, our results
suggest that multi-slice ptychography performs better (see supplementary section 3). This is because
the wave front of an aberrated probe changes between the front and back sides of the nanotube (see
Figure $3 in supplementary section 3), and multi-slice reconstruction helps to compensate for that.
For a comparison between mixed-state-only and mixed-state plus multi-slice ptychography

reconstructions, see the supplementary section 3 (Figure S4 and Figure S5).

The helical structure of nanotubes produces a moiré pattern in (4D-S)TEM images, arising from
the superposition of the tube’s front and back sides relative to the electron beam propagation direction.
This overlap complicates the interpretation of atomic defect structures. Ideally, separating the two
sides would provide deeper insight into the defect structure, which in principle can be achieved using
the virtual depth sectioning capability of multi-slice ptychography [43,76]. Here, the idea is to
numerically isolate the front and back sides from a single projection. We investigated the theoretical
performance of this technique as presented in Figure 7. We simulated 4D-STEM datasets obtained
from a defective (18,12) nanotube structure extracted from MD simulations. Figure 7(a) shows the
structure which contains two 5-7 ring pairs, i.e., ensembles of pentagon and heptagon carbon rings
instead of the standard hexagon graphene-like arrangement. The tube can be divided into two parts,
the frontside, which corresponds to the first part of the tube that encounters the electron beam during
propagation, and the backside, which “sees” the electron beam after propagation across the frontside.
The 5-7 ring pairs are only present on the backside of the tube, and are marked by blue and green
dashed lines in Figure 7(a). The goal here is to compare two multi-slice electron ptychography
reconstructions, corresponding to two experimental conditions, a first one similar to our experiment,
with partially coherent electron beam coming from a X-FEG gun operating at 80 kV (Figure 7(b))
and a second one with more coherent electron beam coming from a CFEG gun operating at 200 kV

(Figure 7(c)).

reconstruction corresponding to a microscope operating at 200 kV with a CFEG gun, frontside (top) and

The depth resolution of this technique is limited by the focal spread of the STEM probe which
depends on the electron wavelength, convergence angle, and coherence, i.e., energy spread, of the
electron beam. The reconstruction from the 80 kV simulated dataset shown in Figure 7(b) fails to
separate both side of the tube. The tube’s moiré pattern is visible in both slices (frontside, top of
Figure 7(b) and backside bottom of Figure 7(b)). This is mainly due to the large focal spread of 25
nm induced by chromatic aberrations in this configuration which is larger than the tube diameter (2
nm). Although the mixed-state formalism can, in principle, compensate for the partial coherence of
the electron beam [77,78], its combination with decoherence from thermal vibrations is too significant
to allow the ptychographic reconstruction to resolve both sides of the tube. In a more favorable
configuration, at 200 kV with a smaller energy spread, the focal spread is now reduced to 3.4 nm.
The corresponding mixed-state-multi-slice reconstruction is shown in Figure 7(c) and it is able to

partially isolate both sides of the tube, even though the focal spread is larger than the tube diameter.

25
Although the contrast in each slice is not perfect, it is possible to directly visualize both defects

(Figure 7(c) bottom).

Therefore, multi-slice ptychography could be a way to directly image atomic defects in
SWCNTs. However, the approach presented in this study suffers from several flaws. First, due to the
small size of SWCNTs and the weak scattering power of individual carbon atoms, it requires large
electron doses (on the order of 10° e~-A~), which can damage the nanotubes during acquisition.
Second, achieving sufficient depth resolution to image both sides of a SWCNT from a single
projection appears to require operating the microscope at high accelerating voltages (200 kV or
higher). Such conditions, however, will induce even stronger knock-on damages during data
acquisition and are not expected to be suitable for carbon nanotube imaging. Several technical
strategies could, be explored to improve multi-slice ptychography performance on SWCNTs.
Possible approaches include increasing the convergence angle and coherence, optimizing the defocus
conditions, improving reconstruction algorithm performances, or combining ptychography with
tomography. However, assessing the feasibility and efficiency of these strategies would require a

dedicated study, which lies beyond the scope of the present paper.

4. Conclusion

We have demonstrated the efficiency of 4D-STEM using a hybrid pixelated detector for
structural characterization of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with multiscale capabilities.
At small convergence angles, this approach enables efficient chirality determination with spatial
resolution down to a few nanometers, making it possible to map chirality variations and track
structural changes along the tube. Additionally, strain mapping was successfully implemented, with
reliable measurement of the radial strain component. It allows to map projected diameter variations
across individual tubes which potentially opens new investigations of the relation between their
structural and electronic properties. We also discussed the influence of the STEM probe convergence
angle on these measurements. First, they are inherently limited by the trade-off between spatial and
reciprocal space resolution, as discussed section 3.1.3. This limitation will become even more
significant when analyzing multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTSs), which are more likely to
exhibit closed interlayer lines. This will severely restrict the maximum usable probe convergence
angle, further reducing spatial resolution. Additionally, radial strain can introduce errors in chirality
determination by altering the measured diameter. While Liu and Qin showed that radial strain should

not impact chirality determination [63], we argue that large radial deformations can, in fact, lead to

26
incorrect chirality assignment when using the ILLS method. Despite these intrinsic limitations, we

were able to define criteria to ensure robust chirality measurement as well as radial strain.

At large convergence angles, 4D-STEM combined with electron ptychography achieves
atomic-scale imaging, reaching a spatial resolution of 1.0 A on SWCNTs. Its strong phase contrast
enables both chirality determination as well as visualization of atomic scale defects within nanotubes.
Despite this, characterizing defects and distortions remains challenging due to the presence of moiré
patterns. While multi-slice electron ptychography improves reconstruction quality, its current
numerical depth sectioning capabilities are not sufficient to fully separate both side of the tubes with
reasonable electron energies and dose. Even current state-of-the-art imaging techniques could fail to
allow direct visualization of atomic defects in SWCNTs. A combination of ptychography and

tomography could offer a solution [68], though such experiments remain technically challenging.

Overall, this work paves the way toward multiscale structural characterization of carbon
nanotubes, from hundreds of nanometers field of view to atomic-resolution imaging, and could be

generalized to other 1D nano-objects.

The one-dimensional integral of this function is defined as:

LQ) = I A(x,y) dex. (AS)

Considering the function’s definition (Eq. A4), Eq. A5 can be written as:
dx, <r
no = ap bist, (A6)
0 lyl>r
Then, Eq. A6 can be simplified to become:
2 a 2) <
40 =| qe vo Whee (A7)
0, lyl >r
This allows to write the squared modulus of the integral of the aperture function which is expressed
as:

A(r? —y?), lyl sr

wae = fOr ge (A8)

e Simplification of the kg peak intensity profile:

Let’s simplify the expression of P,,(kq) in Eq. (14). To do so, we first need to expand the expression
(A@F, 1, )(K). For any layer-line L;, if we consider only the non-zero k, component, we know

Fy (ky) % Jy(ttdok,), (A9)

28
where J, is a v'""-order Bessel function with v a linear combination of the chiral indices (n,m) [26].
Thus, we can write F,,(k) as:

F, Ck) = Fy, Ce ka) & yp tdok,, 0)@5(0, ka — Gi) Ck, ka), (A10)
where 6 is the Dirac delta function. Using the convolution commutativity and the 5 properties with
convolution products, we get:

i(k) « (A@F,,)(K) & [ACK ka — G))®@Jy tdok,, 0)](K), (All)
Now, Eq. (14) can be written as

Krmax

Pi (ka) & J” [LAC ka = 6) @v(doky» 0)](K) Pd. (A12)

Krmax

The only term in Eq. (A12) that depends on kg is A(k,, kg — G;). After all operations: convolution,
squared modulus and integration over k,, the final width of P,,(k,) depends only on the size of the
aperture ky and on the maximum value of J,(dyk,,0). Indeed, convolution with larger absolute
values leads to a larger broadening of the line. Note that we are only interested in the proportions of
P,,. If we replace J,(mdok,,0) in Eq. (A12) with 1, i.e., the maximum value of the normalized
function, Eq. (A12) still preserves proportionality. We have

Krmax
P,, (ka) & | [Ak ka — G)@ 100 (2a, (AL)

—Kkrmax

which can also be written as

Krmax
Pu (ka) & |

Krmax

After the first integral, the resulting function inside the squared modulus in Eq. (A14) only depends

on kq which means the integral from —k,,,,, to k;,,,,, over k, only adds another proportionality factor.

Finally, Eq. (A14) can be simplified as:

+00 2
Pi (Ka) & | A(k, — u,, kg — G;) du, (A15)
Using Eqs. (A6), (A7) and (A8), we get the following solution for Eq. (A15)

tilted at B = 10.1°, as determined by the ILLS method for NT1 and NT2, respectively.

2. Convergence angle limitations for radial strain mapping

To evaluate potential errors in diameter measurements, we simulated SWCNT electron
diffraction patterns at 80kV for a representative set of chiralities: (15,11), (11,11), (23,17), (14,0),
(13,6), (9,4) and (28,3); and for convergence angles between 0.6 and 2.4 mrad. For each diffraction
pattern, we determined the tube diameter by fitting the equatorial line intensity profile along k,., using
two fitting functions. The first one is the squared modulus of a 0"-order Bessel function, |Jo|?, which
is the standard function used in the literature [1—3] and the second one is the squared modulus of a 0"
2

order Bessel function convolved with an aperture function, |A@Jo|*, which we propose as a correction

36
for the convergence angle of the STEM probe. We then calculated the relative diameter errors by
comparing the measured diameters with the ground-truth values from the simulation input, using the
following relation:

d —d
dorror = — a - cruth (2.1)
truti

The results are plotted in Figure S 2. Each marker corresponds to a single chirality and shows the
relative error as a function of the probe convergence angle. Blue and orange markers indicate errors
obtained when the diameter is measured using the |J,|* and the |A@/Jo|* functions, respectively. The
averaged errors across all chiralities are shown by the colored lines, with blue corresponding to the

Jol? function and orange to the |A®J,|? function.

Figure S 2 — Relative errors on diameter measurement from simulated diffraction patterns. Each marker
represents one of the 7 chiralities used in the simulations. The data plotted in blue, shows the error on the
diameter measurement obtained when fitting the equatorial line profile with the |Jg|? function, for a given

convergence angle. In orange, the same error but using the |A@Jo|? function to fit the intensity profile is
shown. In addition, averaged errors for all chiralities are shown by the colored lines, in blue for | Jol? and

orange for |A@Jo|?.

For |A@Jo|?, the errors do not increase with the convergence angle and remain within a
reasonable range between 10 and 10°. This is not the case for |J|*, where the errors gradually
increase for convergence angles greater than 1 mrad. They reach values of several percents even for
angles below 2 mrad which are no longer negligible for strain measurements. Therefore, conducting
experiments with larger convergence angles to improve spatial resolution requires correcting for the
convolution with the aperture function. However, the |A®Jo|* model becomes highly non-linear and
difficult to fit robustly to experimental data with the currently implemented fitting procedure. For a
[2

< 1 mrad, both models yield comparable results, with |J)|* even achieving slightly lower residual

37
errors. This is why in this work, we decided to fit the equatorial line profiles with the |Jg|? function

and to operate with convergence angles smaller than | mrad.

3. Electron ptychography

As introduced in the main text (section 3.3.2), SWCNTs can be described by the weak phase
object approximation [4,5], which implies that their atomic structure can be resolved using the single
slice ptychography formalism. However, because carbon nanotubes are three-dimensional objects
with finite diameters, the wavefront of a convergent electron beam differs slightly between the
entrance and exit of a tube. A STEM probe that is in focus on one side of the tube will be out of focus
on the opposite side, by an amount corresponding to the tube diameter. For example, in the case of
the (37,1) SWCNT presented in this paper, the exit wave front is equivalent to the entrance wave
front propagated by 29.8 A, which corresponds to the theoretical diameter of this tube. This is
illustrated in Figure S 3, where the entrance wave front reconstructed with ptychography is shown in
Figure S 3(a) and the propagated wave front on the other side of the tube is shown in Figure S 3(b).
These images represent electron wave functions by plotting their phase component (color scale)
weighted by their amplitude component using color saturation. Because the diameter of the tube is
relatively small (only a few nanometers), probe propagation does not drastically affect the wave front.
Nonetheless, noticeable differences appear in both the phase and amplitude components, as illustrated
in Figure S 3(c). In the following, we discuss how these differences can influence the ptychographic
reconstructions.

amplitude component using color saturation.

Figure S 4 shows two ptychographic phase images of the (37,1) SWCNT, one reconstructed
using the single slice formalism (Figure S 4(a)) and one using the multi-slice formalism with 2 slices
of 29 A (Figure S 4(b), same as in the paper main text, Figure 6). Both reconstructions were run using

the same parameters apart for the number of slices, with 3 probe modes. As expected, the phase

38
images are similar, although the single slice reconstruction exhibits more pronounced artifacts,
particularly Fresnel fringes on the left side of the tube.

Number of iterations

Figure S 5 - Ptychographic reconstruction residual errors as a function of the number of iterations for the single
slice reconstruction (blue line) and the multi-slice reconstruction (orange line).

This similarity, with the multi-slice method performing slightly better, is also reflected in the
Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE) of the reconstructions. The NMSE quantifies the error
between the modelled diffracted intensities, computed by applying the object and propagation
operators to the modelled probe modes, and the experimental data [6]. Figure S 5 shows the residual
NMSE as a function of the number of iterations for both reconstructions. The single slice and multi-

slice formalisms are plotted with a blue line and orange line, respectively. The two lines are almost

39
superimposed, indicating comparable performance, however, the multi-slice reconstruction yields
lower residual errors, as shown in the inset. Since using only two slices does not significantly increase
reconstruction time or computational resource requirements, we adopted the multi-slice formalism

for ptychographic imaging in this work.

Finally, Figure S 6 shows the reconstructed probe modes of the multi-slice simulation. All
modes are plotted in real (Figure S 6(a)) and reciprocal space (Figure S 6(b)). They are composed of
one main probe mode: probe |, accounting for 98.9% of the total intensity and two additional modes:

probe 2 and probe 3, accounting for 0.7% and 0.3% of the total intensity, respectively.
