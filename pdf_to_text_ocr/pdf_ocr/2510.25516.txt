Abstract

We present for the first time the complete three-loop mixed electroweak-QCD (O(aa,))
corrections for the decay channel H — yy, by implementing three different on-shell a schemes
in computing the electroweak correction. Our studies indicate that the O(a,) correction
amounts to approximately 1.7% of the leading-order prediction for the diphoton width, while
the O(a) correction varies from —4.8% to 1.4% depending on the specific a scheme. The three-
loop mixed electroweak-QCD correction may reach 0.6%, 0.5%, and 0.2% of the LO diphoton
width in a(0), a(Mz), and G,, schemes, respectively, which is much more significant than the
less-than-0.1% contribution from the three-loop QCD correction. It is also worth noting that
the inclusion of the O(aas) correction significantly reduces the scheme dependence of the
partial width from 0.6 keV at leading order down to 0.03 keV. The state-of-the-art Standard
Model predictions are T[H —> 77] = 9.389 + 9.420 keV, providing a valuable theoretical
benchmark for future Higgs factory collider program.

I. INTRODUCTION

The ground-breaking discovery of the Higgs boson by ATLAS and CMS Collaborations
in 2012 [1, 2] has heralded a new epoch of fundamental physics. A high-priority theme
of contemporary high energy physics is to measure all Higgs production and decay
modes as precise as possible and seek the footprint of beyond Standard Model (SM)

physics. No
decay to dip

twithstanding a branching fraction merely of order 10~°, the Higgs boson
hoton is among the original discovering channels of the Higgs boson, thanks

to the very clean signal events and the exceptional precision of photon measurements at
Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Unexaggeratedly speaking, this gold-plated Higgs decay

channel will

continue to play a decisive role in testing SM at LHC and future colliders.

Historically, the theoretical investigations on H — yy decay within SM has under-

gone a long

route. Being a loop-induced process, the leading-order (LO) amplitude

for H — yy has been known since mid-1970s [3-6]. The next-to-leading-order (NLO)
(two-loop) QCD correction was calculated since early 90s [7-16]. Meanwhile, the NLO

electroweak

achieved later in Refs. [16, 23]. The next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO

correction was first investigated in [17-22], with the complete calculation
three-loop)

ZS

QCD correction was computed first with large top mass expansion in late 90s [24], and
was recently determined with full top mass dependence [25, 26]. The N°LO (four-loop)

QCD correc
and comple

tion was first partially inferred by Sturm et al. about a decade ago [27],
ed very recently with large top mass expansion [28]. Partial N4LO QCD

contributions where both photons couple to a massive top loop can also be found in
Ref. [27]. Four-loop analyses based on the principle of maximum conformality appear in

Refs. [29, 3

generation of Higgs factories, viz., the circular e*e~ collider program exem-

plified by CEPC and FCC experiments, aim to measure the branching fraction of H + yy

to a percen

or even sub-percent level [32-34]. Therefore, it appears imperative for

theoretical predictions to the diphoton width to match this projected experimental

accuracy. I

has long been known that the NLO electroweak and QCD corrections

amount to several per cents of the LO contribution. One may naturally speculate that

the mixed e

ectroweak-QCD (three-loop) correction may reach the sub-percent level,

therefore of great phenomenological incentive to add this missing piece of knowledge in
order to meet the projected experimental precision. It is the central goal of this work is

to evaluate t

1e O(aa,) mixed electroweak-QCD correction. For the sake of comparison,

we also re-investigate the complete three-loop O(a2) correction.

The rest

of the paper is distributed as follows. In Section II we decompose the

H — yy amplitude according to Lorentz structure and expresses the decay width in

terms of a s
T(H > 77),

ingle scalar form factor. In Section HI we recapitulate the LO result for

emphasizing that the charged fermions like b, c and 7 should be retained.

We dedicate Section IV to recapitulate the on-shell renormalization scheme used in
computing O(aa,) correction, paying particular attention to the difference among three
a-subschemes. In Section V we briefly outline the technicality encountered in the

calculation.

In Section VI we present the predict the Higgs diphoton width at various

level of perturbative accuracy, as well as report the state-of-the-art predictions for the

H > yy dec

ay rate and branching fraction. Finally we summarize in Section VI.
II. BUILDING DIPHOTON WIDTH OUT OF FORM FACTORS
We start with the amplitude for H > yy:

where pj. and €,(p;,2) signify momenta and polarization vectors affiliated with two
outgoing photons. Lorentz invariance dictates the tensor T“” to be decomposed into
the following most general form:

TH = phipiTy + popsTs + pi psTs + pop Ta
+ pr pogtTs + tt’ pi apoaTe, (2)

where all the nontrivial dynamics are encoded in the six scalar form factors T; (i =
1,---6).
By sending outgoing photons on-shell, transversity condition implies that the T) 93
terms make null contributions to the amplitude. Ward identity p,,7’” = po,T” = 0
enforces T, = —T;. The 7, term first arises from the two-loop electroweak correction
in SM, which brings into the CP violating effect. Fortunately, its interference with
both the LO and the O(a,) amplitude yields a vanishing contribution. Given the
level of accuracy considered in this work, we can safely neglect Tg from the outset.
As a consequence, the amplitude depends solely on a single form factor, viz., T#” =
(pppy — pi pog'”)Ty. The diphoton width of Higgs boson can then be expressed as

11 1M
(HH == —
(41>) = 30M Ba 2

Ta)’. (3)

In practice, it is advantageous to employ the following covariant projectors in d-
dimensional spacetime to exact the scalar form factors T, and Ts [35]:

III. LO RESULT FOR 4H > yy

At LO, the Higgs diphoton decay is mediated via the one-loop diagrams with the
W boson and heavy fermions circuit around. It is customary to break the 7 into two
pieces:

the standard textbook knowledge:

ith the mass ratios defined by aw = MH and ay = Mh represents the electri
with the mass ratios defined by aw = afb and xy = Fyfe. Qs represents the electric

charge of each fermion, while the color factor Cy equals 3 for quarks and 1 for leptons.
Note that in the sum in (7b), we have explicitly included the contributions from heavy
fermions such as bottom, charm-quark as well as 7 lepton, apart from the top quark.
The reason is that they yield contributions of the sub-percent level, which is compatible
with the intended precision targeted in this work.

IV. ON-SHELL RENORMALIZATION SCHEME

The renormalization procedure for computing the QCD corrections up to NNLO
(O(a2)), is straightforward. The UV divergences can be eliminated by replacing the
bare top quark mass with the pole mass through O(a?) accuracy, accompanied by renor-
malizing the strong coupling constant under the MS scheme through O(a?) accuracy.

Electroweak (also mixed electroweak-QCD ) corrections are handled in the widely-
used on-shell renormalization scheme [36, 37], which fixes the renormalized parameters
to be the precisely measured Higgs-boson mass , W/Z masses, top quark mass as
well as the QED coupling. Specifically, we adopt the Fleischer-Jegerlehner tadpole
prescription {38-40} that, instead of introducing tadpole counter-terms, we include all
tadpole diagrams consistently in both the bare amplitudes and the self-energies used
to evaluate the renormalization constants.

We employ three influential variants of electroweak on-shell scheme: a(0), a(Mz),
and G, scheme, which differ with each other in handling QED coupling renormalization.

In the a(0) scheme, the QED coupling is taken as the precisely measured fine struc-
ture constant in the Thomson limit, with the corresponding charge renormalization
constant 6Z, expressed as

Cw M2

1
bZela(o) = 5H" (0) (8)
where II44(s) = 444(s)/s denotes the photon vacuum polarization. Since I144(s) is
inevitably contaminated by non-perturbative hadronic contributions at low invariant
mass, it is convenient to rewrite dZ, as

1, 6 i A(s

where 1144) (M42) represents the photon vacuum polarization evaluated at momentum
transfer M?, by treating five flavors of quarks massless. Aa, (M. z), extracted form

the R-ratio measurement, encompasses the low-energy hadronic contribution. HA4 (0)
denotes the perturbbative contribution to vacuum polarization from W boson, charged
leptons and top quark.

The charge renormalization constants in a(Mz) and G, schemes can be readily

converted from that in a(0) scheme:

where the O(a) expressions of Aa(Mz) and Ar can be found in Ref. [41].

T Mz

where large (non-)logarithmic corrections from light fermion and top quark loops are
resumed, so that perturbative convergence behavior is improved. For more details, we
refer the interested readers to Refs. [41-43].

To investigate the mixed electroweak-QCD corrections to H > yy, we need to extend
the knowledge of field and mass renormalization constants to the O(aa,) accuracy.
Various counterterms, ¢.g., 0Z., Zaz, 0Zaa, 0Zy, 0Mz, 6My can be directly read off
from the analytic O(aa,) gauge-boson and Higgs self energies given in Refs. [44-46]. To
ensure consistent treatment of tadpole contributions, following the procedure of [41] we
rederive these renormalization constants together with the top mass counterterm 6m;
through O(aa,) accuracy. Finally, we take the O(aa,) correction to Ar from Ref. [47].

representative diagrams representing NLO QCD and electrowaek corrections are shown
in Fig. 2, and those representing the NNLO QCD and mixed electroweak—QCD correc-
tions are depicted in Fig. 3.

Lorentz algebra and Dirac traces are handled with the aid of the package
FeynCalc [49] and FormLink [50]. The form factors T;; are extracted from the ampli-
tude by employing the covariant projectors (4). The package Apart [51] is used for par-
tial fraction. All loop integrals are classified with CalcLoop [52], and the integration-by-
parts reduction is executed with the packages Kira [53], Blade [54], and FIRE [55]. The
resulting master integrals are evaluated to high numerical accuracy with AMF low [56-58].

After completing the renormalization procedure as outlined in Sec. IV, we end up
with the UV and IR-finite results for T,; and T;. A stringent test of the correctness of
our calculation is provided by Ward identity, T, = —T5. Our numerical study indicates
that, although the bare quantities appear to disrespect this relation for electroweak
corrections, the Ward identity is exactly restored once the full set of counterterms is
applied, to every perturbative order.

VI. PHENOMENOLOGY

In this section we conduct a detailed numerical investigation on the diphoton width
of Higgs at various perturbative accuracy, paying special attention to the impact of the
O(a?) and O(aa,) corrections.

A. Input parameters

In our numerical study, we choose the following values for various masses [59]:

My = 125.25GeV, Mz =91.1876GeV, My = 80.377GeV, mm, = 172.69 GeV,
Me = 0.5109989 MeV, m, = 105.65837 MeV, m, = 1.77686 GeV. (12)

We further set m. = 1.5 GeV and m = 4.7 GeV in the LO prediction. Charged
lepton masses are retained in the computation of the charge renormalization constant
Z. in the a(0) scheme. Apart from the situations of deducing the LO contribution and
determination of Z,, all quarks (except top quark) and charged leptons are treated as
massless.

We take the fine-structure constant in the Thomson limit, a(0) = 1/137.035999.
With the aid of (11b), the Fermi coupling G,, = 1.1663787 x 10~° GeV ~ translates into
aq, = 1/132.168. The nonperturbative hadronic contribution to the photon vacuum
polarization is chosen as Aa\”,(Myz) = 0.02764 [59].

In line with (11a), the prerequisite of determining a(Mz) is to know the concrete
values of Aa,(Mz) and Aa;(Mz). The nonperturbative parameter Aa,(Mz) can be

interchangeably used with the experimentally determined Aal®), (M z). Aay(Mz) can
be calculated in perturbation theory, whose value is determined through four-loop QED
accuracy [35, 60-62]. We adopt the four-loop result Aay (Mz) © 0.0314979 [62]. Con-
sequently, by employing (lla), we obtain a(Mz) = 1/128.932.

When computing the QCD corrections, we freeze the renormalization scale at the
Higgs mass, and the strong coupling constant is set to a,(My) = 0.115 [63]. The
uncertainty from sliding the renormalization scale is too tiny to be considered here.

At present, the experimentally measured total width of the Higgs boson, Py = sited
MeV [59], is still subject to large uncertainties. To minimise theoretical uncertainty
when predicting the branching ratio of H + yy, we instead turn to much more precise
theoretical prediction, Py = 4,07+4.0% MeV, which was provided by the LHC Higgs
Working Group [59, 64].

B. Numerical predictions for T

Throughout this work we choose to freeze the QED coupling constants associated
with two on-shell photon emission vertices to be a(0). However, within the electroweak
on-shell renormalization scheme, there still exists some freedom in choosing some other
sub-schemes to handle the charge renormalization in the third vertex.

In below we present the expressions of the form factor Ty in three different a aub-
schemes. Firstly, T; in a(0) scheme reads

a2
Ty = —Ts = —0.0488 a*/2(0) [1 + 0.235 92 + 0.235 as “In Oe + 0.122— Os
TT
Aa®,(M
2.934 2) , Eial 2) 433. 280 + 0.118A.0f2) (Mz) (13)
Tv

where Gp signifies the one-loop coefficient of the QCD 6 function with the number of
active flavors nr = 6. Note that in Eq. (13), the imaginary part has been omitted due to
its negligible impact on the decay width. This treatment is justified since both the LO
and O(a,) contributions from the t quark and the W boson, are purely real. Although
the contributions to LO prediction from lighter fermions, such as the b, c, and 7, do
generate an imaginary piece, the interference between them and the imaginary parts
arising from the O(a) and O(aa,) corrections remains well below the sub-percent level,
therefore can be safely neglected.
Alternatively, 7, in a(Mz) scheme reads

C. Numerical predictions for diphoton width and branching fraction

Inserting JT, in (13), (14) and (15) into (3), we then obtain the state-of-the-art
predictions to the [(H — yy) decay rate in three a schemes. In Table I we enumerate
the predicted decay width (in units of keV) at various perturbative accuracy

Firstly, we note that, despite strongly suppressed Yukawa couplings of the b, c and
T relative to that of t, their individual contributions to the LO prediction amount to
0.8%, 0.7%, and 0.7%, respectively. Therefore, to the anticipated sub-percent accuracy,
it is compulsory to include the lighter fermion contribution at LO.

levels of perturbative accuracy. © represents the LO prediction. The numerical values of the
NLO QCD corrections, NLO electroweak correction, NNLO QCD corrections, together with
the three-loop mixed electroweak-QCD corrections, are denoted by PO, TOs), POlaas)
and [' Olas) respectively. We have fixed the QCD renormalization scale wp = My and take
as(My) = 0.115. TS" is the most complete prediction by implementing all the aforemen-
tioned higher-order corrections. The branching fraction in the rightmost column is obtainec

via dividing P°"™ by the predicted full Higgs width, Py = A071 30% MeV [59, 64].

Secondly, it is interesting to point out that, the NLO electroweak correction and
NLO QCD correction are of comparable magnitude !. Moreover, the NLO electroweak
corrections for H — yy from three different a schemes appear to differ significantly. In
particular, the NLO electroweak correction reaches approximately —5% in the a(Mz
scheme, three times greater than in the other two schemes in magnitude. A pronounce:
cancellation between the NLO electroweak and NLO QCD corrections occurs in the
a(Mz) scheme, while the cancellation is almost complete in the G,, scheme.

Thirdly, we notice that the NNLO QCD (O(a?2)) correction is too small to bear phe-
nomenological impact. In contrast, the mixed electroweak-QCD (O(aa;)) correction
can reach 0.5% in the a(0) and a(Mz) schemes, which is about an order of magni-
‘ude more important than the O(a?) correction, and remains sizeable, albeit somewhat
smaller, in the G,, scheme.

Finally, we stress that including electroweak corrections plays a vital role in reducing
she scheme dependence in electroweak sector. The LO predictions span a 0.6 keV range
across three different a schemes. After including all the higher order corrections, the
scheme dependence has been significantly reduced, with the residual spread less than
03 keV.

Incorporating all the aforementioned higher order corrections, we are able to present
the most complete and accurate SM prediction to H + yy. The state-of-the-art dipho-
on width of Higgs is 9.389+9.420 keV, and the branching fraction is (2.3140.09) x 1073,
where the uncertainty is dominated by the theoretical uncertainty inherent in the pre-
dicted Higgs full width.

! This is in sharp contrast to the decay process H —> Zy, where the NLO QCD correction con-
stitutes only 0.3% fraction of the LO prediction, and is much smaller than the NLO electroweak

correction [65, 66].
VII. SUMMARY

In this work, we for the first time accomplish the calculation of the three-loop mixed
electroweak—QCD corrections for the decay channel H — yy. Three different elec-
roweak on-shell renormalization schemes are implemented. We also reinvesigate the
known O(a), O(a) and O(a?) corrections.

We find that the NLO electroweak correction ranges from —4.8% to 1.4% of the
LO prediction in three different a schemes, whereas the NLO QCD correction is about
+1.7%. The three-loop mixed electroweak-QCD correction exceeds 0.5% of the LO
prediction in the a(0) and G,, schemes, and amounts to 0.18% in the G', scheme. In
contrast, the three-loop QCD correction only yields a contribution less than 0.1%, well
below the phenomenological sensitivity.

Including the mixed electrowek-QCD correction turns to be helpful to reduce the
scheme dependence. The predicted LO widths span 0.6 keV across the three schemes.
After including all corrections, the residual scheme dependence is reduced to be less than
.03 keV. Piecing all corrections together, the state-of-the-art predictions are [[H >
77| = 9.389 + 9.420 keV, and B[H + yy] = (2.31 + 0.09) x 107%. This new knowledge
serves a useful reference for the prospective Higgs factories CEPC and FCC to stringently
test the Standard Model, with the projected measurement precision reaching per-mille
evel.
