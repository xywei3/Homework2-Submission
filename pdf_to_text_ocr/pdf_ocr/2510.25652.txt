Abstract

We classify and construct supersymmetric solutions of D=3, N=2 gauged
supergravity extended with a Fayet-Iliopoulos term, and null, timelike,
and warped AdS spacetimes are among them. From the first one, it is
possible to obtain a well-defined black hole by periodic identification.
We also find charged string solutions that interpolate between two su-
persymmetric AdS or Minkowski extrema of the scalar potential, one of
which corresponds to a horizon with a singularity behind it, and the other
determines the asymptotic geometry.

1 Introduction

Three-dimensional (3D) gravity theories provide a fertile ground for investigating
difficult formal questions about quantum gravity, and they have important appli-
cations in AdS3/CFT»2 holography. Over the years, several 3D supergravities have
been constructed, and their properties and connections to other dimensions have
been studied (for a review, see (i]). However, still much remains to be done, in
particular in classifying their supersymmetric solutions.

A systematic approach to this problem was provided by Tod where one uses
Killing spinor bilinears to obtain algebraic and first-order differential conditions to
be satisfied for such a solution to exist. Implementing these conditions simplifies
the form of the physical fields, and most of the field equations are automatically
fulfilled. Using this method in 3D off-shell supergravities leads to some interesting
backgrounds, including timelike, spacelike, and null warped AdS spacetimes (4H7].
For gauged 3D supergravities (8\/9}, it was first used in for an N=8 gauged
supergravity, but explicit solutions were found only in the ungauged limit. Recently,
supersymmetric solutions of an N = 4, gauged supergravity were classified and
constructed using this technique

In this paper, we will apply this method to a 3D, N = 2, matter coupled, U(1)
gauged supergravity. This theory was constructed in and later extended in
by including the Fayet-Iliopulos (FI) term (16|[17]. This extension brings two extra
free parameters to its superpotential, and consequently, scalar potential of the model
gains additional extrema. Supersymmetric backgrounds of [14] (14) were studied in
using other approaches, whereas only the vortex solutions of [15] (15) are known, at
were found numerically in the same paper. N = 2 supersymmetry requires the
target space of the sigma model to be a Kahler manifold. We will focus on the
model of with two real scalars and consider maximally symmetric S?, H? and R?
target space geometries. As it is customary in this method, we classify our solutions
with respect to the norm of the Killing vector that is constructed from the Killing
spinor as null or timelike. In each class, we find a large number of exact solutions
which are listed in Table Those for the R? model are all new. For S? and H?
models, in addition to generalizations of those obtained in with FI terms, we
find some novel solutions that are now allowed thanks to the extra parameters, such
as timelike and null z-warped AdS. These spacetimes attracted a lot of attention
in recent years and have found interesting applications, see for a review. It is
possible to obtain black holes from them by periodic identification similar to
the well-known construction of the BTZ black hole from AdS3 (22). We show that
by restricting parameters of the theory appropriately, our null z-warped solution can

describe a physically well-defined black hole 23}.

Unlike off-shell supergravity theories, where scalar fields are auxiliary, and hence
their Lagrangian contains only a cosmological constant, gauged 3D supergravities
have active scalars and typically include a scalar potential in their action. For these
theories, several supersymmetric string solutions supported by scalar fields have been
found in the past; see, e.g., 4 [24} 26]. One common feature of them is that
they all have a curvature singularity, some naked and some behind a horizon. For our
model, we obtain string solutions with nontrivial gauge fields and, by making suitable
coordinate transformations, show that they interpolate between two supersymmetric
AdS or Minkowski extrema of the scalar potential. One of them corresponds to the
horizon, and the other determines the asymptotic geometry. For the H? and R?
sigma models, horizon exists only when the FI term is present.

Table 1: The list of our supersymmetric solutions. They exist for all R?,S? and
H? sigma models. Our model has two scalars {p, 9} and a vector field A,.

The organization of our paper is as follows. We start with an introduction to
the model that we will work on and explain its connection to two other N = 2
supergravity theories that were constructed earlier 27|. In section [3] we make a
general Killing spinor analysis using Tod’s method and show that one of the
vectors that is constructed using the Killing spinors has to be null or timelike. We
investigate the first option in section [4] and, in addition to wave-type solutions, we

find null z-warped AdS and string solutions. We also study string backgrounds in
some detail by introducing appropriate coordinate systems to look at their singular-
ities and horizons. The timelike Killing vector case is worked out in section [5] We
show that there are seven first-order differential equations to solve. We first look
for exact solutions when one of the scalar fields is constant and find timelike warped
AdS among them. We then consider solutions with circular symmetry with respect
to one of the space coordinates and find "string-like" solutions whose metrics are
almost identical with string solutions of section |4] but have one extra piece that has
no effect on their curvature invariants. We conclude with some future directions and
comments in section [6]

2 The Model

We will study supersymmetric solutions of the U(1) gauged D=3, N = 2 supergravity
constructed in , which is a generalization of the model of with Fayet-[iopoulos
(FD term (16|[17]. Bosonic fields of the model are n complex scalars, a gauge field
A,, and the dreibein. Dynamics of the scalar fields are described by a nonlinear
sigma model whose target space has to be a 2n-dimensional Kahler manifold for the
N = 2 supersymmetry. We will take n = 1 and denote the single complex scalar as
@ = Re'®. Assuming that the Kahler potential K of the target space depends only
on |¢| = R, the bosonic Lagrangian of the model takes the form

1 ‘
L=V-9 (GR — G (0, RO"R + R2D, 0D") — Feta, Fg +9 v) , (1)

where G(R) is the metric of the sigma model target space and
D,,0 = 0,0 + goAz - (2)

Here, go is the gauge coupling constant, and the ungauged model can be obtained by
setting it to zero. The scalar potential V(R) is given in terms of the superpotential
W(R) as:

4

V =2W?- o—(enW)?. (3)

Both the metric G(R) and the superpotential W(R) can be expresssed in terms of a
function C(R) as

1
= =
G = —pAK, (4)
W = C+b, (5)

3
where 0 is an arbitrary real constant. The function C is related to the Kahler potential
K(R) of the target space as

1

where c is a constant. In this paper, we will focus on maximally symmetric target
spaces for the sigma model. This corresponds to choosing the Kahler potential as

K(R) =

ti In(1 + eR?) , for S? (e = 1) and H? (e = —-1), (7)

R?, for R?,

where a? is a constant and the parameter ¢ = +1 labels S? and H? manifolds. To
bring the Lagrangian into a more standard form, we make the change of variable

tanh(ap) , for H?,
R= 4 tan(ap), for pe(-—Z, 4), forS’, (8)
p, for R?,

after which (1) becomes

1 1
L=al=g (GR 0,00") — — 8? D,AD"0 — B eA, Fup +9 vi) . (9)

where

sinh(2ap), for H?,
S=4sin(2ap), for S’, (10)
2ap , for R?

and we take a > 0 without loss of generality. The scalar potential (3) is now

1 ,
V =2(C? +b)? — ase, (11)
where
—stycosh(2ap) + a9 = —4sinh(ap) +c, for H?,
C = 4 ty cos(2ap) + to 4, sin?(ap) +c, for S?, (12)
—p +e, for R?.
Here we introduced a new constant xo for the S? and H? manifolds as

€
=C-—7>- al
ty =C- 55 (13)
Interestingly, for the following choice of parameters {¢ 1a? b = 1/2, 29 = 0}

the potential takes the constant value V = 1/2, although the superpotential
W = cosh(4ap)/2 remains nontrivial. Let us also note some useful identities,

eS”? =1—4a‘(C — 2p)”, (for H? and S?)

05 = dea?(C — x0), (for HI? and S?)
s €
Ea _ ;
“° (c=) 2a mee OE aed)
ll
O,C = —75: (14)

The supersymmetric extrema of the potential are at 06,W = —2CS/a = 0.
From and we find that they are located at

i) p=0: 2 4-—b = AdS, 2? =—b = Minkowski,
ui)C =0,c>0: 6040 AdS, b= 0 Minkowski . (15)

So, there is always a fully supersymmetric AdS or Minkowski vacuum at p = 0, but
the other supersymmetric vacua exist only when c > 0. Such vacua come as a pair
since the potential (11) is invariant under p > —p. There can be only one pair, which
can be seen from (12), and such a pair always exists when c > 0. They are located at
p = +y/c for the R? model. Meanwhile, for the H?, we need x9 > 1/(2a”) from (13).
For S?, since p € (—%, ©) the function cos(2ap) is either positive or negative. If we
assume cos(2ap) > 0 then we need —1/(2a?) < x < 0, otherwise 0 < x < 1/(2a?).
Finally, note that when the vacuum at p = 0 is Minkowski, then the others should
be AdS; but when the vacuum at p = 0 is AdS, the others can be AdS or Minkowski,
when they exist. We illustrate these in Figure (i).

The S? and H? models have 3, ie. {c or x, b, a7}, and the R? model has 2,
namely {c, b}, arbitrary constants. The constant c comes from the U(1) isometry
of the Kahler potential and gives rise to the so-called Fayet-Iliopolous terms (17),
and the constant b is due to the freedom in defining the superpotential (5). Finally,
& = dea? is the Gaussian curvature of the S?(¢ = 1) and H?(e = —1) manifolds.
Since S? is compact, it can not be covered by a single coordinate patch, and the
global consistency of the model requires quantization of the gravitational coupling
constant which in our case gives the condition 1/a? = integer (14).

Figure 1: Graph of the —V(p) given in for the H? sigma model with c > 0.
There is always a supersymmetric vacuum at p = 0 and a pair of supersymmetric
extrema located at C = 0 (indicated with blue dots) when c > 0. They are
Minkowski or AdS, depending on whether (c? + b) and 6 are vanishing or not,
respectively. These characteristics are the same for the S? and R? sigma models.

From (. one finds the field equations of the model as

ViV'p= 3 25% S D,0D"0 — x V,
Viu(S? De) =0,

et! Fyp = ~ 5S" D"0,
1
Rw = up Ovp + GS* DyWDvO — 4g5 V due (16)

Note that setting A,, = 0 = 0 is a consistent truncation.

Finally, for finding supersymmetric solutions of the model, we set the fermions,
that is, gravitino ~ and matter fermion A, and their supersymmetry transformations
to zero:

bp = Vuet+i{(C —c)DyO + gocApse — Wye = 0,
= Gor te ese =
or = (Cup ba SD,0)y"€ a CSe=0, (17)

where ¢€ is a complex spinor and V,€ = (0, + qo,” “Yab) €-

It is easy to see that the R? model above can be obtained by taking the a > 0
limit in the S? or H? models without — the fields. The S* and H? models with
xo = b = 0 were constructed earlier in |14] where a flat sigma model was obtained
by taking the limit a — 0 but it was different pian the apowe one ee To see

k

the reason let us make constant scalings A,, > Ab » Go > gok?, > 7z,cC— 5 while

keeping scalar fields and fermions the same, and then send k — 0 in the Lagrangian
(9) which gives

x fi 1 :
£=-g (GR Op 0p — = 5S? 0,000 — BMA, Fp + 292 (c2 + 0) . (18)

Note that here 6 is uncharged with respect to the R-symmetry group U(1) and as
a result, the potential (11) has reduced to a cosmological constant. This model was
constructed earlier in [27]. After this procedure, the target geometry remains the
same in general. However, if one starts with the S? or H? model with xo = 0 so that
c = ¢/2a? is not an independent parameter but depends on a”, then a — 0 limit is
equivalent to first scaling a > a\/k and then sending k — 0. Since this results in
transforming c — {, one also has to do other scalings above for consistency, which
gives the Lagrangian with flat target space that was found in (14))29}. This
clarifies the connection between different N = 2 3D supergravities that exist in the
literature [14) (14) 15}|27| After this brief introduction, we are now ready to search for
supersymmetric splitions of this model [15] (15).

3 Killing Spinor Analysis

For our analysis of the Killing spinor equations (17), it is more convenient to work
with Majorana spinorq]] Aa (A = 1,2) so that

=), + ids. (19)

Then, the BPS conditions take the form

0 = VyAat+ X, ie — goWyAa, (20)
i B Jo ow
0 = Qpy"ra + 58D wOyMeapr® + 7 ap Aa, (21)
where €4p = —€g4 and ey) = e!? = —1 and
X= (C — ce) DO + gocAn - (22)

lWe follow the same conventions with {12| (1.2\(13} Three-dimensional tangent space indices range
from 0 to 2. The Levi-Civita tensor is €“”? fa the Levi-Civita symbol is <°! = —1 which are
related as fuyo = 3 ee ee = (vag) ten? Gamma matrices with tangent space indices are
chosen as: y° ,y! = 0°, 7 =o, where o’s are the Pauli matrices. The charge conjugation

matrix is C = 5°. We have \ = \'C anda Majorana spinor satisfies \* = —i..
We will use Tod’s Killing spinor bilinears method to classify and construct all
supersymmetric solutions of this model. For that purpose, we assume that there is
a Killing spinor € that solves these supersymmetry conditions (20)-(21) and define
real bilinears

PAB — )ANP = FPA, (23)
WPF = Myo? = VP. (24)

Since indices A, B,... run from 1 to 2, the antisymmetry of F4? implies that
FAB. fAB (25)

where f is a function. This result and the structure of the BPS equations (20)-(21)
are precisely the same with those studied in for the D=3, N = 4, U(1)x U(1)
gauged supergravity with modified definitions of the superpotential W and X,,
(22). Therefore, we will be brief on technical details in deriving some of our results
below, which can be found in these papers.

We first define vectors

Wa V+VP, Ky=Vi-VP, Ly =2VP, (26)
which satisfy

V4K, =V"Ly, = KL, =0, Vink = Guo f L’,
V4V, = —K#K, = IML, = —4f?. (27)

When f 4 0, they form a 3-dimensional orthogonal basis for the Lorentzian space-
time, and when f = 0, one can choose V,, = K, and L, = 0 without loss of general-

ity {10}. From one also gets

Vuln = —WewoV? , (28)
Vuk, = —WewoK? + 2X,,Ly , (29)
Valy = —WewoLl? —2X,Ky. (30)

The first one implies that V(,,V,) = 0, that is, V is either a timelike (f 4 0) or a null
(f = 0) Killing vector. Moreover, by contracting it with V’, we obtain

d,f =0. (31)
Now, (21) leads to

0 = 0,0V", (32)
— Yue _ f vp _ Jo vy
0 = 0, pV, {oD 0 a ; (33)
1
0 = 2f0"p + 5-Se!™D,OVo. (34)

The first line simply means that the Lie derivative of the field p along the Killing
vector V is zero, that is, yp = 0. Now, to have this property also for the remaining
fields, we make the gauge choice

VHA, =4fC, (35)
which differs from the choice made in (12)(13}. After this, we have
Ly0=LyA=0, (36)

where we used the vector field equation in as well.

Solutions are, in general, half-supersymmetric, except for Minkowski and AdS
spacetimes, which are fully supersymmetric. The analysis from this point onward
depends on whether the constant f is vanishing or not. We will now investigate these
two cases separately.

4 Null Killing Vector

In this part, we set f = 0 and denote the null Killing vector as V = 0,. Due to
and (36), none of the physical fields depend on the v-coordinate. Now, assuming
that the scalar field p depends only on the radial r-coordinate , that is, p = p(r),
the most general spacetime metric with V = 0, as its null Killing vector has the

form
ds? = dr? + 26% dud + e??" du? . (37)

Here, the function 6(u, 1) is to be determined, and U(r) is fixed by the superpotential
Ww as
6,U(r) = 2goW . (38)

The computation of the Killing spinors goes through exactly as in (12], and one finds

1
M = (14) e872? A | (39)
where é is a constant real spinor that satisfies (y' — 7°)Ad = 0.
Now, the remaining BPS conditions that follow from (83) and (34) are

SD,0=0, (40)
(C —c)D,0 = —gocA, , (41)
(C — c)D,0 = —gocAu, (42)
a,p = aes. (43)

With these conditions, the field equations for p and 6 in are identically satisfied.
Due to our gauge choice (35), we have A, = 0 which sets F,, = Fi, = 0, and the
only remaining vector field equation is

1
Fy, = —GS'D.8. (44)

Finally, it can be shown that all Einstein’s field equations hold except for Ru, which
gives the following condition for the metric function 6(u,1r)

0, (240, (62°22) = —48"(D,0) (45)
When the right-hand side of this equation is zero, setting e?? = 0 is a solution. Its ho-
mogeneous solutions can actually be found using the Garfinkle-Vachaspati solution-
generating method {30}, starting with the same metric with e?? = 0 (sce for
details), and they are locally trivial (31). This method is applicable when the initial
solution has a null Killing vector.

Now, implies that either S = 0 (which is equivalent to p = 0) or D,6 = 0.
With the first option, the scalar field @ decouples from the model, and the vector
field becomes pure gauge. The latter implies that either c = 0 or A, = 0 from (41).
When c = 0 again the vector field is pure gauge and we have D,0 = 0 fom I)
(here if C = 0 then p = 0). This analysis shows that, without loss of generality, we
can choose

A,=0 , 0=0u), (46)

after which (40) and (41) are automatically satisfied.
To summarize, for a supersymmetric solution in this class, we only have to solve 4

equations (42)-(45) for the fields {p(r), Au(r,u),0(u), 8(u, r)}. The spacetime metric
is given by (37) where the metric function U(r) should satisfy 8). We will now
analyze these equations in 3 parts: i) p = 0, ii) p = constant # 0, iii) otherwise.

10
41 p=0
In this case, from and (0)- (22) we have
S=0 , C=ce , W=4+bd , V=2%(e%+))*. (47)

From and we see that the vector field is pure gauge, which we choose as
A, = 0, and the field 9 remains free. Now, is solved as

U(r) = 2g(C + d)r,
(48)

where we set an arbitrary additive constant to zero by scaling the v-coordinate.
Finally, solving (45) for e?? we find

ds? = dr? + 2649+)" dudu + edu? , (49)
where
: c3(u)r + © ife+b=
oo c3(u)r cal) ; fe Oi (50)
c3(ujetPrr + ex(u), if? +b#0.
Its curvature scalar is R = —24g?(c? + b)?. This is a pp-wave in Minkowski or AdS

spacetime, depending on whether (c?b) vanishes or not, respectively. Although c3(w)
and c4(u) terms can be generated by the Garfinkle-Vachaspati method and locally
trivial, they may have global significance. For instance, when c? + b 4 0 and c3
and cy, are constant, the metric is of Kaigorodov type which is equivalent to
the extremal BTZ black hole with mass Mp = 2gobc, and angular momentum
J= C4.

4.2 p=constant 4 0

When p is a nonzero constant we have S = constant 4 0 (£0). Then implies
that C = 0, which means that these solutions emerge at the supersymmetric extrema
of the potential (11) that are not at the origin. From and (Lo)- (22) we obtain

C=0 , W=bd , V=20 , c>0. (51)
With these, 8). and (44) are solved as
U(r) =2gobr , O(u) =constant , Ax(u,r) = Q(u)e2”" , (52)

11
where Q(u) is an arbitrary function, and we introduced the nonzero constant

= hoe _ oa — 4a‘x?) , i on H?, (53)
Then, solving (4), we find the following 2 types of solutions:
Case 1: Electromagnetic Waves
When W = b= 40 or W = b= 0 the metric is
ds? = dr? + 2e49°"dudu + e?8du? , (54)
where
8 = aes + ¢4(u) — ep egonr ifW=b=0, (55)
c3(u)et9o" + c4(u) — goQ?(ujret"", if W=b=n #0.
Its curvature scalar is R = —24g? b? . Here, the locally nontrivial piece is the Q?(u)

term, and the solution represents an electromagnetic wave in AdS (when W = b =
n # 0) or Minkowski (when W = b = 0) spacetime. When the vector field is switched
off, the form of the solution coincides with the previous one given in (29).

Case 2: Null z-warped AdS3

When W = b#4 7, n 4 0 and b # 0 we find

ds* = dr? + 2649" dudu + [e3(u)e49°" + c4(u) + we (w Ws £0" du? , (56)

with
R = —24g5 b”. (57)

This solution generically corresponds to an AdS wave. However, if we choose c3(w),
ca(u) and Q(u) as constants and perform the change of coordinates

_ pAgobr _ 4 to 58
y=e , o Dqob Dob (58)

12
we get

il dy? Q?

OS Tg (i ydido [ yet ay |e) a)
where a = c3, 3 = cy and Q are constants. The gauge field takes the form
Q
A= n/(2b) dg.
apie (60)

When a = 6 = 0 and Q #0, is called the null z-warped AdS spacetime with

2 = ox 61
; (61)
This choice is special since then both the metric and the gauge field are invariant
under the following anisotropic scaling

yoy , @>gOdX* , totr”?, (62)

Depending on the sign of the y* term in (59), this solution is labeled with "plus"
or "minus" respectively. If we also fix the scaling exponent to z = 2 so that the t-
coordinate does not scale, then this solution is called null warped AdS or Schrédinger
spacetime (34).

As was shown in 23}, the metric (56) describes a physically well-defined black
hole if the ¢ coordinate is periodic (¢ ~ ¢ + 27) and

z>2 , BS2al , B40 , a4#0 , Q=A4(b—7n). (63)

Note that after this identification, the scaling symmetry is broken and the sign of
the y* term in (59) has to be "plus", which implies b > 7. This requirement, together
with the z > 2 condition, can be realized if we have the restriction 7 < 2b < 0 on the
parameters of the model, where 77 is defined in @3). When this condition is satisfied,
this model admits a null z-warped AdS black hole.

Supersymmetric null z-warped AdS solutions appeared in off-shell supergravities
before (4\(5\(7). However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first appearance of
supersymmetric null z-warped Ad§ black hole in a gauged supergravity. Null warped
Ad (i.e. z = 2) is a solution of a D=3, N = 4 gauged supergravity but with
"minus" sign for the y* term in G9. and hence it is not suitable for a black hole
construction. Such supersymmetric black holes also exist in Minimal Massive
Supergravity (361/37). In that case, the warping is due to the higher curvature terms
in the theory. Whereas, here it is created by the gauge field (60).

4.3 String Solutions

We now consider the p = p(r) 4 constant case. Here, instead of using the r-
coordinate as the radial coordinate (37), it is possible to use the field p (or the func-
tions C or S) as the radial coordinate via the BPS equation (43). This is convenient
since it is not always possible to express p as a function of r in terms of elementary
functions except for the R? case. Whereas the opposite direction is straightforward.
Doing this change, our metric as becomes

ds* = dp? + 2e79) dudu + e?%?) du? (64)

The metric function U(r), using equations and (43) should satisfy

Ay = ee ,where 0,0 = Q(u) => D0 ot) (69)

After this, it can be shown that the gauge field equation is automatically satisfied
using (43). So, this solution for the vector field is only valid when p is not equal to

14

(68)
a constant. Also note that, for a nontrivial A,, we need c 4 0. Finally, using (69) in
(45) and integrating twice we get

8 = e(u)e@ + eg(ujeet [cS 4e-ap — SOu)e” | e-4S-eMdp, (70)
0

where c3(u) and c4(w) are integration constants. Results of these integrations are
too complicated to present here, but they can be seen for the xo = b = 0 case for
the S? and H? sigma models in (see its equation (3.35)), where a hypergeometric
function shows up. The c3(u) and c4(u) terms can be obtained using the Garfinkle-
Vachaspati method [30]. They correspond to waves on the background and can
be removed from the solution by local coordinate transformations [31]. Meanwhile,
the Q(u) term corresponds to an electromagnetic wave (18). Therefore, the spacetime
metric describes a string superposed with waves in general. For the S? and H?
target spaces, this solution with Q(u) = x = b = 0 appeared in and a later
charged version of that (i.e. Q(u) 4 0) was found in [18}.

We will now investigate the singularity structure of these string solutions. Look-
ing at two of their curvature invariants

1692
R = —2Ag2(C? + b)? 4 “igh,

we see that they approach smoothly to the supersymmetric extremum of the potential

p—0 c>0

lim Ry RM = 192g3(c? + b)* , lim RR! = 192g4b' . (72)
p> si

The points where g,, component of the metric (64) becomes infinite are candidates for
a horizon. It is important to note that this happens when CS = 0, which is precisely
where the supersymmetric extrema of the potential are located. We will now
introduce suitable coordinates for each sigma model to check this observation. We
do not need the explicit form of e?°) since it has no effect on curvature invariants
or location of horizons. Hence, for the discussion below, we will set it to zero, which
is allowed when the string has no charge.

4.3.1 R* Sigma Model

Here, it is convenient to work with the variable w = p~? > 0. Now, for c = 0 the
string metric (64) becomes
dw?
ds? = —— + demu + dudv . (73)
1699
Note that as w > 0 (p — 0), the metric is that of the AdS in Poincaré coordinates
if b 4 0 or Minkowski spacetime if b = 0. However, there is a naked singularity as
w — 0, which can also be seen from its curvature scalar

On the other hand the metric for c 4 0 is

dw? 1\*
ds? ; wu + Qe-w [1 — ew|-edudv. (75)
16g(1 — cw)? w

As above, it is easy to see that in the limit w > o we have either AdS (when
c +b #0) or Minkowski spacetime (when c? + b = 0) and there is a singularity as
w — 0. However, when c > 0, there is now a horizon at w = 1/c, which is precisely
where the potential has another supersymmetric vacua (15), namely at C = 0
(22). The near-horizon geometry is either Minkowski (for b = 0) or AdS (for b # 0).
Note that the near-horizon and asymptotic geometries can not both be Minkowski.
All these can also be seen from its scalar curvature

4.3.2 S? Sigma Model

Recall that for S? the constant 1/a? is an integer. Let us first consider the
case %9 # +1/(2a?). We also assume c > 0 so that the potential possesses a
supersymmetric extrema at C = 0 for which we choose the cos(2ap) > 0 branch
so that the constant x is restricted as —1/(2a) < a < 0. After the coordinate

we determine its behavior around special points of the metric as

Clearly, there is a curvature singularity at w = 0 and a horizon located at w = Ton

(that is, p = 0). It is easy to see from the metric that the horizon is locally
either Minkowski or AdS, depending on whether c? + b is zero or not, respectively.
Asymptotic geometry (w — o or C — 0) is AdS if b 4 0 or Minkowski otherwise.
This black string solution with b = x = 0 was found in and had similar features.
However, notice that in that case the asymptotic limit is necessarily Minkowski, and
the near-horizon geometry must be AdS. Finally, let us note that when b = x = 0
and a? = 1/2 the solution becomes identical with the one found in for the
low energy limit of the 3D String theory as noted in [14].

When xp = 1/(2a”) we have c = 1/a? and C = cos*(ap)/a?. After the coordinate
transformation w = sec?(ap) string metric (64) becomes

It behaves as
lim R =-0, lim Rk = —24g)(c +b), Jim, R = 24950? . (82)

17
Similar to the above solution, there is a curvature singularity at w = 0, a horizon
at w = 1 (or p = 0), and the asymptotic geometry (w — ) is either Minkowski or
Ads.

When 29 = —1/(2a?), we have c = 0 and hence there is only one supersymmetric
vacuum of the potential (ui). Thus, the corresponding string solutions have naked
singularities.

4.3.3 H? Sigma Model

Let us first assume 2) 4 +1/(2a) and take 2p > 1/(2a?). Defining w = sinh7?(ap)
its metric becomes

where b = —?*1. Its scalar curvature is too long to present here, but it has the
9 qqt
limits
lim R = +0, lim R= —24.g5 0? , lim R = —24g3( +b)?. (84)
ue ue 2azag—1 o

There is a curvature singularity at w = 0 (carrying the sign of (8a? — 3)), a horizon
at w= aia (or C = 0) and asymptotic geometry (w — % or p > 0) is Minkowski
or AdS. This solution with 29 = b = 0 was obtained in (14), but in that case there is
no horizon and the asymptotic geometry is AdS.

For « = +1/(2a?), the potential has only one supersymmetric extremum at
p = 0 and hence the string solution has a naked singularity.

5 Timelike Killing Vector
We will now investigate the timelike case and take f > 0. The most general spacetime
metric that admits a timelike Killing vector V = 0; with norm —4f? can be written

as a product of a 2-dimensional base space U2 and a timelike fiber

ds? = —4f?[dt + M(a,y)dx + N(x, y)dy]’ + 2?) (dx? + dy?). (85)

18
The base space “yj has constant Gaussian curvature « if the conformal factor 7
satisfies Liouville’s differential equation

(0, + Oo = —Ke”” . (86)
With this metric, the conditions can be solved as
K,, = (0,2fe’ sin yp, 2fe’ cosy), L, = (0,2fe’ cosy, —2 fe’ sin y) , (87)

where y(t, x,y) is an arbitrary function to be determined. Then the Killing spinors
are found to be

. || sin(~/2) . | f | cos(e/2)
A= (1+) 4/5 l: me » A= (14a) 5 sel (88)

From these Majorana spinors, one gets the complex Killing spinor of these solutions

Note that because of (32) and (36), scalar fields and the vector field do not depend
on the time coordinate t. Our gauge choice implies that

A, = 4fC. 91)
Using this result and in we get
Op = —8f gob, 92)
DOC = 0,(c6-+ 50) + Soyo + Af goMW 93)
DyOC = O,(cb x0) 500 AfgoNW . 94)

From (28) we derive

1, s
= —,—fe “(M, — Nz), 95
qf (My ~ Ne) (95)
This completes the information available in the Killing spinor equation (20). Next,
from the BPS conditions (83)-(34) we find

1
Ozp = ~ 5, 9(Pu? —AfgoCN),

1
Oyp = 5-S(DzO — 4 fgoCM). (96)

Now, one can show that when the above first-order conditions are satisfied, all field
equations are also satisfied except the xy-component of the vector field equation

2
Py = ae f[ND,0 + MD,0 — Af goC(M? + N*)| + goCe??} . (97)

To summarize, for a supersymmetric solution in this class, we have to solve 7 first-
order coupled differential equations (92)-(97) for 8 unknowns (M, N,o,y, Az, Ay, 9, p).
Although, this system looks like under determined at first sight, but after defining
a new spinor function 6 = cO+ ze (recall that 0,4 = 0) and using the fact that
90F ry = Or(Dy8) — (D9), we end up with 7 differential equations for 7 unknowns
(M, N,o,¢, D,9, D9, p). Solving this system in full generality is clearly a difficult
problem except when p is equal to a constant. This is what we will consider in the
next two subsections, and then for the general case, make a simplifying ansatz.

5.1 p=0

When p = 0, a 7) conditions listed in (£7). The field @ disappears = all
the equations (92| and therefore remains ee Moreover, equations in are
automatically eo and ( (7 gives F,, = 0. So, we can choose a = = 0
without loss of generality. The only equations to be solved are which
simplify to

0=0,p + Oyo + 8fgoWM,

0 = yp — 0,0 + 8fgoWN . (98)
Let us es out that combining the last two and using (9 (25). one gets Liouville’s
equation (86) for o with ee curvature k = —16g3W?, which shows that the

base space 7 of the metric is either flat or hyperbolic, depending on whether
W is vanishing or not. We now SS te these two possibilities separately.

20
Case 1: W 40

In this case, we have W = c? +b # 0. The first equation in gives
g = —8fgobt + G(x, y) (99)

for some function G(z,y). But, using a new time coordinate ¢ = t— eT ae (x,y), and
redefining metric functions M and N we can set G(x,y) = 0 Oz = dyp = 0,

as in (13). Remaining equations can be solved as

o=-In [1 — 4g8W? (a? + ”)| ;

uae 2 y
f 1 AggW?(a? + y?)’
goW x
N ome 100
FP 1-4 Wa? +) uo)
and the scalar curvature is R = —24gé(c? + b)?. The solution is Ad93 in global

coordinates, as was shown in (13).

Case 2: W =0

This corresponds to setting W = c? + b = 0, which also implies V = 0. Since all
scalar and vector fields vanish, these are pure gravity solutions and are Ricci flat. In

this case, (98) become

Ap = 8f ge” ,

Onp = —Oyo ,
Oye = O20 « (101)
The first one gives
yp = 8fgc?t+ G(a,y). (102)

Note that both G and o are harmonic functions and they can be used to define a
holomorphic function

A(z) =o +iG, (103)

where z = x + iy. From (95), we see that Mdx + Ndy is closed. If we assume that
the space part of our solution is simply connected, then the Poincaré lemma implies

21
that we can find a function F(x, y) such that Mdx + Ndy = dF. But then, we can
define a new time coordinate t = 2ft + F(x,y) to get rid of F(x,y) and redefine
G(a,y). After this, the metric takes the form

ds* = —dt? + e?* (dx? + dy’). (104)

Any choice of the holomorphic function H(z) gives a supersymmetric solution with
the above metric, as happened in (see its equations (6.28)-(6.30)). For exam-
ple,the choice H(z) = x + ty leads to

ds* = —dt? + dw? + wdy’, (105)

where w = e*. This solution can be designated as Euclidean Rindler spacetime {19}.
If the range of y is restricted to 0 < |y| < 27, then it describes a conical spacetime.

5.2 p=constant # 0

In this case, from we can read the gauge field components as

A, = —L0,6 + 4fCM ,

018
OyO + 4FCN . (106)

The remaining equations to be solved are

Onp = —8f 90,
Or + Oyo = —8fgobM ,
OyP — Ort = —8f gobN , (107)

where ¢ = 2c0+ y. The last two lines give Liouville’s equation for o with
Gaussian curvature « = —16g3bW. In all the solutions we present below, we have
kK <0, that is, Wb > 0.
Since p 0 we have S ¥ 0 and using in one finds
CS?

CW = Tae? (108)
which implies that either C = 0 or W = S?/4a?. For the latter, the potential
has the value V = 2W(2b— W) and this point is not an extremum in general, but
this happens when C = 2p for the S* manifold, which occurs at p = +7/(4a) (12).
This condition, together with the definition of the superpotential (5). fixes the value
of p # 0 unless x = 0, a? 4b € = 1, for which it is automatically satisfied.

22
Case 1: C =0

When C = 0 and p # 0, from we see that c 4 0 and x% 4 0 and S has
the same value (3). Note that since the superpotential is now W = b, the base
space Ly of our metric has Gaussian curvature « = —16gb?. So, it is either flat
or hyperbolic. This case is very similar to the p = 0 case that we considered above.
For b # 0, making the change W — b in the AdS solution is enough. For b = 0,
instead of (102), we now have ¢ = G(x, y), and the rest is the same. These solutions
emerge at the supersymmetric extrema of the potential (4).

Case 2: Timelike Warped Flat

We now assume W = S?/(4a”) 4 0, C # 0 and b = 0. From (107) we see that
functions @ and o, define a holomorphic function

H(z) =o+i¢. (109)

Any choice of H(z) gives a supersymmetric solution by solving the first line of (107)
for M and N. Since o is a harmonic function, base space Nz of our metric (85) is
always flat from for any choice of the function H(z) and spacetime curvature is
always positive:

R = 8g,W?. (110)
For example, by choosing H(z) = 0 and setting @ = N = 0 the solution is

8goW
f
which is called timelike warped flat due to the Hopf vibration, and it is a

homogeneous spacetime [40]. Since W = C? ¥ 0, there is always warping, and it is
proportional to A,A" = —4C?.

29

ds? = —(2fdt yd)? tde®+dy? , A, = (4fC,-

Cy,0), (111)

Case 3: Timelike stretched AdS;

We now assume W = S?/(4a?) 4 0, C # 0 and b # 0. In solving the system
(107), we can again set

0=0 , G=yp=—B8gobt (112)

23
by shifting the time coordinate and making a gauge transformation. Then, one can
start solving from Liouville’s equation (86) for o with x = —16gbW. For any a, the
spacetime curvature is always constant:

R = 8g,W(W — 4b). 3)
For example, equations can be solved as
gobW y 8fg0by
with the requirement
Wb>0, 5)

which implies that the base space Ny is hyperbolic. Since W = S?/4a? is positive,
we need b > 0. The metric is (after scaling the time coordinate as f = 8fgobt and
then dropping the hat)

1 dx\* dx? + dy?

This is the "stretched" timelike warped AdS3 with the warping parameter v?. The
term "stretched" refers to the fact that v? > 1 (since b > 0 and C # 0). The gauge
field is given as

One can relate the warping parameter to the norm of the gauge field A? = A,,A“ as

which was first observed in |4| where this supersymmetric solution was found for an
off-shell supergravity (see also (5|(7)). Note that, since C 4 0 and p ¥ 0, this solution
does not appear at a supersymmetric extrema of the potential (1a).

24
5.3 Circularly Symmetric Solutions

We now assume that p is not constant. To simplify the equation system (92)-(97),
we will take the x-coordinate as a circular direction and consider the circularly sym-
metric ansatz:

p= ply); og =o(y), M=Mv(y), N=A,=0,
A, = 4fC, Az = x(y) + 7: y= —Afgobt + kx , 0=—ne, 20)
where n and & are constants. Then we are left with the following system of equations
ap = 2sx 21
Oyp = FSX, )

Oyo = 29o(CX — 4fbM) + 2cen—k, 23)
S?
OyX = 2goCe?? (aw = =) , 24)
where we defined
X=x-4fCM. 25)

These equations were first derived in and later studied in for the x) = b =0
case. In it was shown that this system admits |n|-vortex solutions using numerical
methods. In these backgrounds, the function y is not constant and solutions have
asymptotically conical geometry for b = 0 and 2cn—k # 0. By differentiating
and using others, one arrives at the following constraint for the unknown functions

‘ 4f
XY? + 16f7?bM? + Lik Qen)M — 4e°W = p, (126)

Jo
where p is a constant, as was observed in . This condition reduces the number of
unknowns to 3. Furthermore, one can use p as the independent variable instead of

y, using (221). Then equations (122)-(224) take the form

4

Sx0,M = Few, (127)

SX0,0 = 4a(CX — 4fbM) + 2cn—k, (128)
S?

SXOpX = 4aCe”? (aw = =) ; (129)

25
So, effectively, there are only 2 first-order differential equations to solve, but due to
their nonlinear structure, this is still a very difficult problem. Below we will find
exact solutions when the vector field function y is a constant. Let us point out that
there are two other special choices that simplify the equation system (127)- (229).
When 6 = 0 equation and when a? 4b e=1( 4Wa S*)
equation become integrable. However, in the end, these lead to the solution
with y = 0, with the parameters specified to those particular values.

String-like Solutions

We now assume y = 0, that is,

y=0 = %=-4/CM. (130)
Equation (124) is equivalent to
2 :
ayx = —~PS{ PM (x —4fCM) + Ce} . (131)
So, when x = 0 we have
er = 4f?M?. (132)

With (130) and (132), equation (129) is automatically satisfied together, and the
constraint (126) holds with p = 0. Then, compatibility of (127) and (128) requires

2en—k=0. (133)
So, we only have to solve (127) or (128). But comparing (128) with we see that
o=2U. (134)

Then, the solution metric becomes (after some trivial scalings)
a? dp?
REC
where the function U is given in (66) . (67) and (68] . For the S? and H? sigma models,
this solution with ao = b = 0 was found in [19]. Notice that the form of the metric
is almost the same with the string solution (64), and due to this similarity, we will
call this solution "string-like' as in [19]. The extra —dé? term in this metric has
no effect on curvature invariants like the e?° piece there, and therefore, these two
solutions have the same singularity and horizon structure that we studied in section
However, when the local geometry is AdS, due to this extra piece, the metric is

of Kaigorodov type (see {18}/19}).

26

ds? = —dt? — 2e" dxdt +

(135)

ary
Case 2: x = constant 4 0

Let y = xo # 0 be a constant. Again, setting 2cn — k = 0 is necessary. In this

case (131) gives
pra, (136)

Now, one can compute 0,M from both equations (128) and (129) and they are
compatible only for the H? manifold with the following choices:

a =4b=-e=1. (137)
Assuming xo = 0, the corresponding solution is

eo = 258-4, Y= —yyS?, M = SC. (138)

The constraint is satisfied with p = 0 as above. Note that it is not possi-
ble to take yo > 0 limit. Although changing y from zero to a nonzero value is a
trivial gauge transformation, we see that it results in a solution that is quite dif
ferent than the y = 0 solution with the same parameters for which we have
e? = AMiS~4C?, Y = —4MpS~°C?, M = MoS~°C/f. This is due to the nonlinear
nature of these differential equations. After defining gow = In|tanh(ap)| and some
straightforward scalings, its metric becomes

ds? = —dt? + 2cosh(2gow)dadt — 4sinh?(gow)dx? + dw”, (139)

with scalar curvature

Fak) A 308 (2a00)) (140)

When w — © (or p — 0) its curvature scalar takes the value R = —6g? and there is
a naked singularity as w > 0 (or p > 0). Unfortunately, we could not identify this
spacetime.

6 Conclusions

In this paper, we studied supersymmetric solutions of the 3D N = 2 gauged super-
gravity extended with FI-term, which was constructed in (15). Using Killing spinor

27
bilinears, we first derived all the necessary conditions for such a solution to exist
and then constructed many examples, which are listed in Table |l} We expect them
to be useful in various contexts. Among them, we have supersymmetric examples
of timelike and null z-warped AdS which are quite rare in the literature.
They require Fl-term to be present, and curiously, only the latter appears at super-
symmetric extrema. As we showed, parameters of the model allow the null z-warped
Ad solution to be converted into a well-defined black hole, and understanding holo-
graphic aspects of it is clearly desirable {23}. The fact that the scaling exponent z is
free provides an opportunity to go beyond the better understood z = 2 case (41).

Another interesting outcome of our work is the black string and string-like
(135) solutions with horizons located at the supersymmetric vacua of the potential
which has AdS or Minkowski geometry. To clarify their global structure and con-
served charges 42], more work is needed. A detailed analysis of geodesics would
help in understanding whether their singularity is physically acceptable or not [43].
Moreover, our exact string solutions can also be used to analyze holographic renor-
malization group flows as in (24)/44}{47]. Those that connect two AdS vacua are
especially interesting to explore.

A natural continuation of the present work is to construct supersymmetric so-
lutions of the ungauged version of this model. This problem was studied for the
ungauged limit of a 3D N = 4 model in for which the target space of the sigma
model is H?. It was found that for timelike solutions, the sigma model target space
metric is identified with the space part of the spacetime metric, and solutions are
characterized in terms of two holomorphic functions. The model we considered in
this paper provides an opportunity to explore this phenomenon for other sigma model
geometries.

Embedding this model into 3D gauged supergravities with more supercharges
also remains to be done. Finding its higher-dimensional origin looks even more
challenging [25} |48}{50), especially when the sigma model target space is compact.
We hope to examine these issues in the near future.
