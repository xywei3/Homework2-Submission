ABSTRACT: The rich analytic structure of hadronic form factors makes a theoretically con-
sistent yet easily applicable parametrisation cumbersome. Consequently, most parametri-
sations are limited to reproducing the simplest analytic features sufficient to describe form
factors on their first Riemann sheet. Here, we introduce two novel form factor parametri-
sations that allow resonance poles and left-hand cuts on the second Riemann sheet to be
studied, while also making the connection to partial-wave amplitudes manifest.

1 Introduction

Production and decays of hadrons are governed by the low-energy dynamics of Quantum

Chromodynamics (QCD) and, consequently, fall outside the range of perturbation theory.

However, Lorentz invariance of the relevant am

plitudes allows for a decomposition into ten-

sor structures and multi-valued scalar functions, known as form factors (FFs). To obtain

predictions, these FFs must be constrained by measurements, general theoretical consider-

ations, or lattice QCD calculations. However, t

1ese inputs are usually only available within

specific kinematic regimes and often need to be extrapolated to the region of interest. To

this end, a parametrisation encapsulating all the relevant features of the FF is required.

In this work, we focus on form factors that describe the transition between two hadrons

or the creation of two hadrons from the QCD vacuum. Such FFs only depend on one

dynamical variable, the invariant mass of the

wo-hadron system s. The most prominent
example of such a FF is the pion vector form factor, which enters in a range of physical
processes, chief among them pion pair-production in electron—positron collisions, decays of
the tau-lepton, and electron—pion scattering. The first two processes probe the timelike
region of the FF, while the latter involves spacelike momentum transfer. The situation
is even more complex for FFs of two-hadron states with different masses, where a third
region describing the kinematics of the decay of the heavier to the lighter hadron appears.

A method to systematically parametrise FFs under question, in particular for applica-
tions in the spacelike or the decay region, has been introduced more than six decades ago
by Meiman [1] and Okubo [2, 3]: conformally map s, such that the entire first Riemann
sheet of the FF is contained inside the unit disc, while the branch cut is mapped onto the
circle. FFs can then be expanded in a power series in this new variable. While the original
concept has been improved many times over the years [4-10], the conformal map at its
heart has remained the same.

Here, we introduce a set of improved conformal maps that take into account more
of the analytic features of the FFs, leading to significantly improved convergence in the
timelike production region, as well as allowing for the precise determination of resonance
poles and residues, or scattering phases.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. First, we discuss the analytic
structure of FFs in Sec. 2, followed by the introduction of an improved version of the
single-threshold map in Sec. 3. In Sec. 4, we present a novel conformal map that takes into
account two thresholds. We conclude in Sec. 5.

2 Analytic structure of form factors

Two-hadron form factors! are analytic functions of the complex s-plane and satisfy the
Schwarz reflection property:

Consequently, they are real below the first threshold and have a branch cut above. This
threshold corresponds to the energy of the lowest on-shell two-particle state that satisfies
the form factor quantum numbers, e.g., 4M? for the pion scalar and vector form factors.
The start of the branch cut does not need to coincide with the pair production threshold;
cf., e.g., the case of the vector isovector kaon form factor, for which the first threshold
is 4M? instead of 4M? [13, 14]. In addition, some form factors possess poles below the
branch cut, corresponding to bound states, for example, the B* in the Ba vector form
factor.

Above the first threshold and below the first inelastic threshold, Watson’s theorem [15]
dictates that the phase of the form factor is equal to that of the corresponding partial-wave
amplitude. The threshold behaviour is given by

Im F(s) =O ((s - 54) PHD) ; (2.2)

‘Here and in the following, the discussion is always meant to be restricted to hadrons stable in QCD.
The analytic structure of the form factors becomes significantly more involved if one of the hadrons is a
resonance; cf., e.g., Refs. [11, 12] for discussions of the analytic properties of the wm transition form factor.
where / denotes the partial wave of the two-hadron system. Finally, at large s, form factors
need to drop off sufficiently fast, typically as 1/s [16-20].
The form factors can be continued onto their second Riemann sheet? by identifying

between the first threshold and the inelastic threshold. This leads to a simple relation
between the two Riemann sheets [8]

where o,(s) = J/1— 4M2/s is the appropriate phase-space factor, t the partial-wave am-
plitude, and S the partial-wave-projected scattering matrix element. As a consequence, the
analytic structure on the second sheet is richer than on the first. In addition to the regular
(right-hand) branch cut (RHC), the appearance of the partial-wave projected scattering

amplitude introduces a left-hand cut (LHC) on the second sheet, running from s_ to —o0o.®

Furthermore, resonances and virtual states correspond to poles on the second sheet of the
form factors or, equivalently, to zeros of the S-matrix on the first sheet. While resonance
poles appear in complex conjugate pairs, virtual states are situated on the real axis below
the RHC, analogous to bound states on the first sheet. The analytic structure of the form

factor on its second sheet is depicted in Fig. 1.

2.1 The z-expansion

Simple parametrisations of form factors can be derived by a conformal map from s to z
given by

Here, s+ is the position of the first threshold, and so < s, determines the value of s mapped

to z=0. This transformation maps s, to z = —1 and all real values of s < s+ to the real
interval —1 < z < 1. The branch cut is mapped to the unit circle and consequently the
entire first Riemann sheet is situated within the unit disc, while the second sheet fills the

remaining complex plane. The latter can be obtained from

zy(s) = 1/z(s; 84,5 WB} = Fwy — 80
u(s) = 1/2(s; 54, 50) me fe (2.6)

Both maps can be inverted via

s z)? — 482

?In the following, the Riemann sheets will be denoted with numbers according to the branch cut they
share. The first branch cut separates the Riemann sheets I and II, which are further split by the second
branch cut into 11, 12, 21, and 22.

“Note that behind the left-hand cut lies another Riemann sheet, which has a new right-hand cut. This
process continues indefinitely, resulting in an infinite sequence of Riemann sheets. Details can be found in
Appendix A.

sheets. The singularities include a left-hand cut (red line), a unitarity cut opening at s4
(dark blue line) with higher-energy branch cuts (light blue line) opening at the inelastic
threshold sin, as well as resonance poles s, (purple dots).

The poles on the second Riemann sheet lie outside of the unit disc, and their distance from
it is determined by their width. In general, the left-hand cut extends from the negative

real value of z1z(s_) to —oo and then back from oo to 1, where the points s = too of both
Riemann sheets are mapped to. If so = s_, the situation simplifies and the left-hand cut
runs from z1;(s_) = 00 to 1. These properties are summarised in Fig. 2.

The variable z is convenient to parametrise form factors if the goal is to describe the
region s < s,. In this case, they can be expressed as

This series expansion (SE) parametrisation, often referred to as the Boyd—Grinstein—Lebed

(BGL) parametrisation [4], is a powerful tool for describing form factors relevant to semilep-
tonic B-meson decays.
Many variations of the BGL parametrisation exist, optimised to different applications.

e Setting dr = 1 and replacing Br by a simple pole-factor in s, one obtains a simplified

parametrisation in reference to the global analysis in Ref. [21]). While simpler than
the SE one, this parametrisation loses the diagonal structure of the unitarity bounds.

The SSE parametrisation can be improved to implement the correct threshold be-
haviour. This has been first derived for the case of | = 1 form factors, such as the
Br vector form factor in Ref. [7] and is referred to as the Bourrely-Caprini-Lellouch
(BCL) parametrisation.

e An additional weight function was introduced to enforce the correct drop-off be-
haviour for s + 00 and at s = s; for a study of the electromagnetic pion form factor
by Buck and Lebed [5].

The impact on the unitarity bounds of poles above threshold was studied in Ref. [8].

The introduction of explicit poles outside of the unit disc, addressing the convergence
issue observed by Buck and Lebed, was studied in Ref. [9]. This approach allowed
for a purely data-driven determination of the pole location of the p-resonance and its
residue.

Not allowing for complex zeros in the unit disc improves the convergence in case of
the pion vector form factor [22-25].

All of them have in common that only the first Riemann sheet is contained in the unit disc,
and thus they are not suitable for describing the form factors for s > s+.
3 Improved conformal expansions

To describe the form factors beyond the first inelastic threshold, one needs to modify the
conformal map suggested in Eq. (2.5). We first present an improvement of the usual SE
to account for the LHC and to ensure convergence of the series in the region of interest.
To test our parametrisation, we fit it to pseudo-data for the scalar isoscalar and the vector
isovector pion form factors that we sample via the Omnés representation [26] with phase
input from the (modified) inverse amplitude method.

3.1 The left-hand cut and the ¢-map

The radius of convergence of the usual SE in Eq. (2.8) is limited to 1 both by higher-energy
branch cuts that are mapped to symmetric arcs of the unit circle and by the LHC of the
second Riemann sheet, which is usually mapped to z € [1, co]. In particular, the usual SE
is not expected to be valid in any region of the second sheet.

In practice, the coefficients of the SE are fitted to experimental or theoretical inputs,
and the domain of validity of the parametrisation is non-trivially deformed by numerical
instabilities and oscillations due to Runge’s phenomenon. As found in Ref. [5], the presence
of resonance poles on the second sheet, close to the unit circle, can, for example, drastically

affect the region of convergence of the SE. Although explicitly parametrising these poles
significantly improves the description of the data [9], relating the pole parameters to the
physical parameters of the T matrix requires the SE to be valid at the pole position, which,

as described above, is not ensured by the usual z-map.

As we will show below, the parameters of the poles that are close to the unit circle,
such as the p(770)-resonance of the vector pion form factor, can still be correctly described
by their imprint on the first sheet. Poles that are further away from the region of conver-

gence, however, suffer from blind directions in the fit, which make the extraction of their
parameters from data more challenging.

A more promising approach consists of modifying the conformal map in Eq. (2.5) to
account for the LHC explicitly. By doing so, we ensure that singularities only stem from
parametrisable poles and higher-order branch cuts. This can be achieved by applying the
same idea as for the pair-production branch cut in s. Concretely, we define the following

conformal map

visible on the plane, sheets I and II = II* are separated by the RHC, II* and II7 by the
LHC, and I~ and III* by a RHC. Another LHC still spans ¢ = 1 to 00, see Appendix A
for details. Higher-energy branch cuts due to other channels are not represented. The
physical timelike region where the scattering data lies is highlighted in white.

where s) = s_ is chosen to map the LHC on the z € [1,00] range and 2p is a free parameter
that satisfies w(z0, 0) = 0. The analytic structure of the form factor in the ¢-plane is
sketched in Fig. 3. In this variable, the point s = oo corresponds to ¢ = 1, the first (I) and
second (II) Riemann sheets are mapped inside the unit disc, and the left-hand cut spans
the unit circle. Two Riemann sheets are accessible outside the disc. Following the naming
scheme of Ref. [27], they are labelled II” and III* and are separated by a right-hand cut,
already opened by the ¢-map. More information on how these sheets are connected is
provided in Appendix A and in Ref. [27]. Higher-energy branch cuts due to heavier final
states (e.g., KK or mw in the case of the pion form factors) are still present between the
first and the second sheets. Finally, as detailed in Appendix A, a new left-hand cut extends
from ¢ = 1 to oo.
The second Riemann sheet in s can be reached via

Gu(s) = G(s; 84, 20) = w(z(s; 54, s—), 20) , (3.4)
while the ones behind the left-hand cut are given by

Gr-(s) = Ot Gut (s) = aa (3.5)

As for the z-map, all four sheets also share a common inverse, which is defined by

Our theoretical model only includes the 77 channel and the lowest-lying resonances, namely
the fo(500) and the p(770), respectively. The advantage of using generated data is that the
resonance parameters can be extracted exactly from the IAM and compared with the values
obtained from the fits in ¢ and z. We provide the position of the poles in the variables z
and ¢ in Table 1. For the scalar isoscalar pion form factor, we employ a modified version
of the IAM (mIAM) that can accurately reproduce the location of the Adler zero [29, 30].
More details on the two models are provided in Appendix C. A complete analysis of the
data, including uncertainties, is kept for future work.

where ¢, = G1(Sp) is the position of the fo(500) or p(770) pole in the ¢-plane. We also
impose s,_ = 4M?2, 80 = s_, and z = 0. A similar parametrisation, obtained by replacing
¢ with z, is also used for comparison purposes.®

The pseudo-data consist of 50 data points sampled in the energy interval s € [0, 1] GeV?
for the scalar form factor and in s € (0, 1.2] GeV? for the vector one. We fit this data with
the z and ¢ SSE using different values of the truncation order, n = 3,4, and 5. From the
best-fit points, we extract the pole positions of the o = f(500) and p = p(770) resonances,
as well as their couplings to pions, photons, or light quarks (as detailed in Appendix D).
The results are displayed in Tables 2 and 3, where we also provide an indicative x? obtained
by assuming the input points to be uncorrelated and with an uncertainty of 1. For a given
truncation order, we find that the ¢ SSE always performs better than the z one, in terms
of y?, position, and coupling of the resonances. With n = 4, all the resonance parameters
are correctly captured by the ¢-expansion, while this is still not the case for the z one with
n= 5. This suggests that the convergence of the ¢-expansion is very fast, even when fitting
data above the elastic threshold.

For completeness, the modelled form factors and their best n = 3 fits are displayed in
Fig. 4. In the physical region, all the fits visually agree perfectly with the data. We recall

that these tests are intended as a proof of concept to demonstrate the possibilities that
this new variable offers. A more in-depth analysis of the data, including the extraction of
the pole positions, is beyond the scope of the present manuscript.

°This parametrisation slightly differs from that of Ref. [9], as we do not impose high-energy or threshold
behaviour on the series.

3.3. Conformal parametrisation for partial-wave amplitudes

One significant advantage of the ¢-parametrisations over those based on z is that the
former’s domain of validity extends to part of the second Riemann sheet. Consequently,
we can use the relationship between the form factors and the partial-wave projections of
the S-matrix elements to parameterise these functions simultaneously. Rewriting Eq. (2.4),
we have the following parametrisation for the mz partial-wave amplitude in terms of the

form factor on its first and second sheets,

parametrisation; simply by replacing ¢(s) ++ G(s) in Eq. (3.7). The ¢-parametrisation, by

construction, fulfils the following desired properties:

e The phases of t(s) and F(s) match exactly along the unitarity cut, therefore auto-

matically ensuring unitarity in the form of Watson’s theorem [15].

e A resonance pole s, on the second sheet of the form factor Fyy(s) automatically

produces a zero for the 7m — ma S-matrix element S(s) = 1—26,(s)t(s) and, thus,

a pole on the second sheet St7(s) at the same position s,.

e By construction of the conformal variable ¢ a left-hand cut for Fy7(s) and, thus, also
for t(s) is produced. This is not the case if z is used instead of ¢ as the conformal

variable.

On the other hand, since we do not constrain Fy;(0) = 0, Eq. (3.12) imposes the partial

wave amplitude to vanish at s 0 instead

of at its Adler zero. Yet, the combination

of these properties offers the possibility to examine the form factor and the partial-wave

scattering amplitude within a single framework.

Firstly, one can predict the partial-wave amplitude from a fit to the form factor. This

is particularly challenging, as it requires an accurate description of the form factor on both

the first and the second Riemann sheets. We

results. The ¢ SSE performs very well above threshold, as expected from our Watson’s

theorem, but deviates from the model below

sheets using a parametrisation that ensures unitarity. Similar results were obtained in the
vector case, albeit with small shifts at the resonance poles.

Finally, the fit can be performed on both datasets simultaneously, which should, if
performed on experimental data, considerably reduce the form factor and partial-wave
uncertainties.

4 Beyond the inelastic threshold

We have shown that, by opening the LHC, the parametrisations based on the ¢-map allow
for a much more accurate description of the form factors in the physical region. In practice,
however, their range of validity is limited by the presence of higher-energy branch cuts due
to the opening of inelastic thresholds. For example, we do not expect the parametrisation
of the pion form factors presented in the previous section to be valid above sin © 1 GeV?,
where the KK and mw inelasticities become large.

Extending the validity of the parametrisations based on a z-map was already suggested
in Ref. [6], where a hybrid approach relying on Omnés functions [26] was suggested. The z-
map is performed with the inelastic threshold s;, instead of the first threshold s,, while an
Omnés function describes the branch cut in the elastic regime. In Ref. [33], this approach
was combined with the correct threshold-scaling at the inelastic threshold following BCL to
describe the 77 invariant mass spectrum in B + a7€v decays. The main drawback of this
approach is that the effect of resonances on the second sheet is encoded in the phase shifts
that enter the Omnés functions and cannot be directly extracted from the form factors.

In the following, we present a new strategy that combines the strengths of the ¢-map

with the ideas of the hybrid Omnés—z-map approach.

4.1 Conformal 4-sheet map

Following the idea from Ref. [6] and replacing not only s+ from the z-map with sin, but
also sy > s4 and z—> @?, leads us to the inverse of a conformal variable ¢, given by

s4(1 oF ey _ sing?
(1—@?)?

9($) = 9(; 84, in) (4.1)
which now incorporates not one but two thresholds. The variable ¢ therefore opens up two
unitarity cuts, and maps the corresponding four Riemann sheets to distinct regions in the
complex plane. For the different Riemann sheets, the ¢-map reads

_ V Sin — 8 — V/Sin — S- _
Vs —-8

V Sin — $+ /Sin — S$
/s_—s

which can also be obtained by taking the square root of z and using the same associations

dcr) (8) = (11) (5; $4, Sin) $(21)(S; $+, Sin) = —(21)(8) ,

(22) (8) = $22) (3 $4, Sin) = (12) ($3 $4, Sin) = —G(12)(8), (4-2)

for the thresholds as above. A graphic representation of the complex ¢-plane can be found
in Fig. 7. With ¢, the (11) (also referred to as the physical or first sheet) and (21) sheets
are mapped to the inside of the unit circle, while the (12) and (22) sheets are mapped
to the outside. This is the key difference to a similar map introduced in Refs. [34, 35],
where the (11) sheet lies outside of the unit circle and instead the (12) sheet lies inside,
thus prohibiting a useful power series expansion. The first and second threshold, s, and

Sin, respectively correspond to ¢ = 0 and ¢ = +i. Similarly, the point s = 0 is mapped to
the real axis between 0 and 1 or —1 and 0 depending on whether the (11) or (21) sheet is

considered, and the points s = +oo meet at ¢ = +1. The physical axis, approaching the

cuts from above, follows the white line pictured specifically in Fig. 7. In this figure, the
connection between the different sheets is clearly visible. In the elastic region, the physical
sheet is adjacent to the (21) sheet, but directly connects to the (22) one above the second
threshold.

Although the ¢-map correctly unfolds the elastic and inelastic branch cuts, it cannot
be directly used in a Taylor series because of the LHC on the (21) sheet. This LHC starts
at or = $21)(s—) < 0 and ends at ¢ = —1, and would, thus, limit the region of convergence
of such a series to |¢| < —dz. Similar to before, we therefore need to find a way to unfold
the LHC, although we now have the advantage that both the (11) and (21) sheets are
within the disc already.

4.2 The final parametrisation

As for the ¢-map, we can circumvent the left-hand-cut limitation by pushing the cut onto
the unit circle itself. This involves distorting some of the lines that separate the Riemann
sheets in the ¢-plane, but it can be done while keeping the rest of the (11) and (21)
Riemann sheets inside the unit disc. This is achieved by using another map, called yx,
which is derived in more detail in Appendix E. It is given by

_ VA-vB with A= («(xz — 1)? — ap (@ — 1)?) (#9 — 1)?
~ VA+VB’ B= (ao(az — 1)? — a1(ao — 1)?)(# — 1)?

where xy is the point at which the left-hand cut opens, that is pushed onto the border of

the unit disc, and zp is a free parameter that satisfies x(xo, 1,70) = 0. For clarity, we

—14—
restricted the definition of y to the region |x| < 1 in Eq. (4.3). To avoid any unexpected
behaviour, we therefore use a piece-wise definition for our final 4-sheet map, which we call

w and write as
x(G(s; $4, Sin), ¢z,60) — for|d| <1
PAP Hoy rr rr 7 for|¢| >17 (4.4)

where ¢ is defined in Eq. (4.2). Above, @p = ¢(21)(s_) is the branch point of the left-hand
cut in @, and ¢9 = $(11)(so) corresponds to the point mapped to w11)(so) = 0. Analogously,
the inverse of w is given by

x (W, bx, b0) for |p| <1
$(W; $4, Sin, S_, 80) = 1 for |u| > 1 (4.5)

The complex ~-plane with the left-hand cut pushed to the boundary of the unit circle is
pictured in Fig. 8, for the choices so = s, and so = 0. In contrast to the ¢-map, which
aims at opening the LHC on the second sheet, the ~-variable still presents a cut when
crossing the arc of the circle. In Fig. 8, we kept the (12) label for the sheet behind this
cut; however, our parametrisation does not differentiate this sheet from the (217) sheet
obtained by analytically continuing the (21) sheet across the cut.

The visible distortion of the boundaries between the sheets and the size of the arc
covered by the LHC increases with the distance between the elastic and inelastic thresholds,
84 and Sin. In the limit sj, + oo, the y-map reduces to the ¢-map

where P(~) is an appropriate product of poles that implements bound states and reso-

by imposing the correct threshold behaviour since it currently implements a square-root

4.3 Application to the scalar pion form factor

We now test the ~ SSE using pseudo-data again. The sj, + oo limit in Eq. (4.7) already
ensures that the 7 SSE performs at least as good as the ¢ one on the test cases of Sec. 3.2,
ie., on models that do not implement an inelastic threshold. To further test the possibilities
of the ~ SSE, we study a more realistic example of the scalar pion form factor. Since we
can now parametrise the form factor above the elastic threshold, we simultaneously fit
the strange and non-strange form factors, as defined in Refs. [38-45]. We implement the
resonances up to the fo(980), and the product of poles takes the same form for both form
factors

tively. As detailed in Ref. [46], the position of the resonance poles on the Riemann sheets
that are not contiguous to the physical sheet does not depend on the resonance mass and
width only. We treat, therefore, all these poles as uncorrelated. We provide the position

of these poles in the w-plane, as found in the literature, in Table 4. Although the fo(500)

and f(980) are expected to have poles on all the unphysical sheets, we only implement the
ones listed above, as they are the closest to our input data and, therefore, the only ones
relevant to our simple analysis. As for the previous tests of Sec. 3.2, we do not impose any
additional constraints on the high-energy or threshold behaviour of the SSE.

The input pseudo-data is generated by sampling 636 data points in the range s €
(0, 1.5] GeV? from the coupled-channel Omnés matrix of Ref. [44]. Our fit results for dif-
ferent truncation orders are provided in Table 5, and the shape of the form factors for
n = 11 are shown in Fig. 9. We find that a higher truncation order is required than in the

previous analysis to obtain a visually satisfactory description of the data. This is because
this parametrisation aims to describe the first two sheets completely. Yet, with n = 11,
we obtain a visually excellent description of the data in the region where convergence is

expected, namely below s = 1.5GeV*, where our input model breaks down. For larger
values of n, the fit exhibits many local minima, so a more in-depth statistical analysis
would be needed. We find that the parametrisation is able to reproduce the position of the

resonance poles, even on the (21) and (22), albeit with errors. As mentioned above and

discussed in the literature, the position of the f9(980) poles on these two sheets differs [46].

5 Conclusions & Outlook

The two novel parametrisations introduced here allow for a more detailed study of the
second Riemann sheet of hadronic form factors, including resonance poles, as well as the
left-hand cut required by unitarity. The first parametrisation is ideal to study purely
theoretical form factors with only a single channel, such as the pion vector and scalar form

factors obtained from the mIAM. The second parametrisation explicitly accounts for the

second two-particle threshold, meaning it can be used in the future to analyse experimental
data and extract phase shifts, resonance poles, and residues. Sample applications improved
the convergence properties of both parametrisations with respect to the commonly used
z-expansion, demonstrating the advantage of directly encoding as many of the analytical
structures of form factors as possible in the expansion variable.

A direct application of the conformal four-sheet map would be a fit to ebe7 3 ata

and T~ + 1 m’v, experimental data to extract the resonances’ pole locations and residues.

In contrast to the z-expansion approach of Ref. [9], the p(770) pole is directly within the

convergence radius, allowing for a more detailed study of the pole properties.

Several variations of the parametrisations are also of interest. A generalisation to the
case with a first channel that features unequal-mass particles would allow for studies of
tT — Krv;, decays and applications to semileptonic decays, for example, D > mlvy decays
where the D* resonance lies closely above the first threshold. In addition to the high-
energy behaviour, also the behaviour at 51, si), and s_ of form factors is known and, thus,

can be implemented in the parametrisation, either following Refs. [7, 33] by expanding

in suitable polynomials, or by directly imposing constraints on the expansion coefficients.
Going beyond mesons, our method to incorporate resonance poles in a way that respects
all analytic properties of partial waves and production amplitudes may prove useful also
for the precise extraction of resonance properties in meson—baryon systems, where methods
going beyond the Breit-Wigner approximation are urgently sought after; cf., e.g., Refs. [47,
48]. Incorporating the four-sheet map in the Khuri~Treiman formalism would allow us to
improve the parametrisation of B — amv decays introduced in Ref. [33]. Finally, going
beyond two-particle thresholds or two channels is phenomenologically significant, but it
involves function spaces beyond those considered here. However, first investigations of
the three-channel problem, albeit without taking into account left-hand cuts, have been
conducted in Ref. [49].

A Riemann sheet structure from two-particle intermediate states

Let us briefly review the Riemann sheet structure arising from a two-particle intermediate

state by following the example of the scalar two-loop function

It is analytic in the complex variable s up to singular points that can be determined by
the means of Landau’s equations [50]. Here, they take the form

In addition to their positions, Landau’s analysis also predicts the types of the resulting
singularities. In this case, they are square-root branch points. The solutions for ay and ag
corresponding to s, are real and positive, lying within the Feynman parameter integration
range. This causes a branch cu

the case for s_, as one of the corresponding a; is negative, which only leads to singularities

this simple example of the scalar loop function, one can explicitly write down the analytic
continuation to all these sheets as

Bow«(s) = Bo(s)+(N—1)U(s) with (s) = oT spa eys=e, (A.4)

which explains the naming scheme. The function /(s) can be obtained, for example, via
Cutkosky rules or via the discontinuity calculus developed in Ref. [27].

In general, while the exact details of the analytic continuation may differ, any two-
particle intermediate state results in the same two thresholds sy and s— and the same
infinite cascade of Riemann sheets. Rather than simple square-root cusp behaviour at
the thresholds, the /-th partial wave of the two-particle system opens as (s — sz) 2H0/ 2
However, this does not change the square-root nature of the branch points (as opposed to

logarithmic-type branch points, which split into infinitely many sheets).

B_ One-threshold ¢-variable with 2” sheets

In Eq. (3.3), we introduce a new conformal variable ¢(s) that maps the first and second
Riemann sheets of a hypothetical one-threshold form factor into the unit disc. This is
achieved by unfolding the left-hand cut of the second sheet of the standard z-plane in
Fig. 2 onto the unit circle. Similarly to how the original z-variable features the second
sheet as a “reflection” at the unit circle, zy = 1/z1, this new map also has two more
“reflected” sheets outside of the unit circle, Qy- = 1/G and G+ = 1/G, as can be seen in
Fig. 3. In the complex ¢-plane, these four Riemann sheets are nested around each other.
As discussed in Appendix A, the outermost layer Fyy,+(s) features another LHC, which in
the ¢-plane runs from ¢ = 1 to ¢ = 00 if z = 0 is used.

In principle, one can repeat the same procedure by iteratively unfolding the appearing
LHCs. This would result in doubling the amount of layered Riemann sheets mapped into

the unit disc each time. Denoting with n the number of times the w-map defined in
Eq. (3.1) is applied to unfold LHCs, this yields the following series of recursively defined
new variables,

6) (5; 84, Co) = (8: 84, 20 = Go) = w(2(s 84, $_), Go) ,
CFD (384,60) = w(6 (8; 54,0); G0) . (B.1)
For each of these variables, ¢) is the only free parameter and determines the point that is
mapped to the origin. For a fixed number n, the map ¢ ) features 2” sheets within the

unit disc and behaves as

I =1,1=1 case are given in, e.g., Ref. [54] and read

The values of F = 88.27 MeV and I = 487?(J} — 21) = 5.98 are taken from Ref. [28], and we
use the charged pion mass M, = 139.57 MeV. The resulting phase of the IAM is pictured
in Fig. 10 (right).

D_ Relation between pole parameters and coupling constants

As shown in Ref. [9], one great advantage of the parametrisations based on a conformal
expansion is that they provide direct access to all the couplings of the resonances. In the
vicinity of the f9(500) and (770) resonance poles, we parametrise the m7 partial-wave
amplitudes and form factors on their respective second sheets in the following way,

to relate the pole residues to the appropriate coupling constants. Here, we used o = (500)
for short and denoted by geqq the coupling of the fy(500) resonance to a non-strange scalar
qq current, similar to Ref. [31]. Following the lines of Refs. [32, 55], we can also relate the
couplings to the form factors evaluated on the first sheet as follows,

In combination, by computing both the second-sheet residues and the first-sheet values of
the form factors at the respective pole locations, we can extract all individual coupling
constants simultaneously.

E_ Left-hand-cut transformation

This section describes how the y map, which allows us to implement the left-hand cut of
the (21) Riemann sheet, is constructed. The mechanism we apply is inspired by the use of
the z-map to account for subthreshold cuts in Ref. [10]. This reference uses two z-maps,
which only differ from each other with respect to their thresholds, s, (both planes are
pictured in Fig. 11 in the bottom row). To distinguish the two corresponding z-planes, we
call the one with the cut inside the unit circle x and the one with the cut on the boundary
of the unit circle y in the following. These maps are defined by

xv = 2(5; 8p,0), y = 2(83 8a, $0), (E.1)

respectively, with z referring to the original z-map from Eq. (2.5). Analogously, the inverse
maps are given by s(x; 5,,0) and s(y; Sa, 80). The idea of the y-map is to identify the ¢-
plane in Fig. 7 with the lower-left plane in Fig. 11, and use two consecutive maps to obtain
the lower-right plane, which is free of cuts in the disc.

In practice, we use an intermediate, unphysical s-plane (top plot in Fig. 11) in which

we treat our left-hand cut like a subthreshold cut starting at s, and ending at sj). The
x-map from one plane to the other is thus obtained with

¥ = xX(X, a, Xo) = 2(8(2; 59,0); 5a, 80) = (8(@s 8p, 0); $(@a3 85, 0), (2203 80, 0))

and a right-hand cut starting at s,). Bottom left: The plane we obtain if we use the map
x = 2(8; 8,0) from Eq. (E.1) on the unphysical s-plane on top. The points x; are defined by
x; = 2(8;; 8p,0). Bottom right: The plane we obtain if we use the map y = 2z(s; Sa, 89) from
Eq. (E.1) on the unphysical s-plane on top. The points y; are defined by y; = 2(s;; Sa, $0).

which only depends on the starting point xq of the cut inside the unit circle in x and the
point xp that we map to the centre of the y-plane. Following the same strategy, the inverse
of this transformation, from y back to x, can then be written as
v= x '(y, 2a, 20) = 2(8(ys 8(xa3 8p, 0), (20; 8», 0)); 1,0)

which still only depends on 2, and xp. For our purposes, x, translates to the point where

the left-hand cut opens up on the (21) sheet in ¢. When using x to define our resulting
map, however, we need to consider that in the process of deriving y we used the inverse
of the z-map s(z), which is not an injective function since s(z) = s(zm) = s(1/z). Asa
consequence, we need to distinguish carefully between input values with an absolute value
< lor > 1 when using x. Strictly speaking, it is only valid for input values with an
absolute value < 1 in general, as it will otherwise introduce unwanted cuts in our map,
making it necessary to employ a piece-wise definition when using it for a variable that also
should be able to take input values > 1.
