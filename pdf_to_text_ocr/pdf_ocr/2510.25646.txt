1 Introduction

Since the first ground-based observation of a signal from a black-hole-binary merger at the
Laser Interferometer Gravitational- Wave Observatory (LIGO) [2], gravitational waves (GWs)
1ave become one of the most promising tools for discovering fundamental physics on astro-
physical and cosmological scales. GWs are ripples, caused by the motion of massive objects,
hat perturb the spacetime metric and propagate at the speed of light.!

Current and future methods of observing GWs across the spectrum include ground-
yased interferometers such as LIGO at high frequencies f ~ 100 Hz [2], space-based interfer-
ometers such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) at intermediate frequencies
f ~ 107% Hz [4], and Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) at very low frequencies f ~ 107® Hz [5].
Pulsars can be viewed as extremely precise clocks, as the variation in their rotational
period is very small, leading to a corresponding small variation in the emission time of their
pulses of EM radiation. PTAs utilise this by measuring the difference in arrival times between
‘wo consecutive pulses, shifted by a gravitational wave passing through the space between the
oulsar and Earth. In addition to pulsars, the astrometric measurement of asteroids has also
been explored as a viable source to measure GWs, as discussed in [6]. Although the relative
accuracy of astrometric tracking is several orders of magnitude worse than that of timing
measurements, the number of objects one could track is many orders of magnitude greater
han the small number of pulsars being used in PTA observations. The complementarity in
accuracy versus scale makes astrometric alternatives to PTA observations particularly inter-
esting for constraining stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB). Indeed, efforts
along these lines are already underway using quasars [7] and galactic astrometry [8].

A new generation of optical survey telescopes promises the accuracy needed to track
solar system bodies, such as asteroids, making astrometric SGWB a possibility. For example,
the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) survey at the new Vera C. Rubin Observatory
is expected to detect millions of small objects over the next 10 years [9]. The possibility of
cross-correlating different low-frequency observables introduces two distinct advantages. The
first is to measure the spectral properties of the time-dependent SGWB signal more robustly
by combining observables that do not suffer correlated systematic uncertainties. The second
is the ability to validate the nature of the SGWB using the expected angular correlations

‘This is the case in Einsteinian general relativity, but may not be in other gravity theories. [3]
for each combination. In this work, we focus on the latter aspect and derive the expected
angular correlation patterns induced by an SGWB in several combinations of observables.

This paper is organised as follows. We make use of the formalism introduced in [1] to
write the cross-correlation of short-distance and long-distance observations in timing residu-
als, astrometry, and shimmering [10]. In Section 2, we review the definition of spin-0 (scalar
and pseudo-scalar), spin-1 (vector) and spin-2 (tensor) observables that capture the redshift,
astrometry, and image distortion caused by an SGWB. In Sections 3.16 and 4, we determine
the angular two-point correlation functions between the combination of observables. The
correlation functions are the analogues to the Hellings-Downs curve [11] for the generalised
combinations. In Section 5, we present forecasts for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sen-
sitivity curves that are expected when measuring the correlation functions. We end with a
discussion of our findings and prospects for these new techniques in Section 6.

2 Astrometric, Shimmering, and Timing Observables

To define our observables, we start by considering an image of a source with flux intensity
I(f) where ? denotes the unit vector along the line-of-sight in angular direction (65,5) on
the sky. When GWs perturb the background null geodesic between an observer and the
source, the image observed is distorted by

Tops (7) = True + On) , (2.1)

where df is the distortion vector at any point on the sky [10]. In the following, we introduce
a notation 67 to specify the vector distortion induced by a GW of unit amplitude. This is
motivated by our focus on the angular correlations induced by different observables. In this
case, the angular response of the effect is of interest rather than the amplitude of the GW.?

When considering vector or tensor quantities, such as the astrometric and shimmering
perturbations induced by distortion, one needs to define an orthonormal basis for decompos-
ing such objects. We make use of an orthonormal basis on the plane perpendicular to the
line-of-sight ” or the direction of propagation of the GW q. For example, when considering
the direction g = (9,¢@), we define basis vectors perpendicular to g and lying on the tangent
plane to it

é® = (—sind,cos¢,0), (2.2a)
é° = (cos@ cos ¢, cos @ sin ¢, — sin@), (2.2b)

as well as the auxiliary vector
6(q) = 6° + ie, (2.3)

that will be used to define a circularly polarised GW [1]. For a GW aligned in the g = 4
direction, this vector is

6(2) = e'*(@+ ig), (2.4)

The discussion below follows the formalism introduced in detail in [1, 10] where the reader can follow a
more in-depth introduction. Here, we focus on introducing the necessary concepts required for the particular
application.
after a rotation of the arbitrary phase. In standard general relativity, we have two Einsteinian
transverse, traceless polarisations. The polarisation tensors defining these can be written in
terms of the basis vectors introduced above as

ei (@) = ees — ee? , (2.5
~ 50 5 50 00
eig(G) = ees + Pes. (2.6)
We can also define left- and right-circularly polarised GWs as
L/R :
a = Gi ck ie F (2.7)

In other theories of gravity with more degrees of freedom, there may also be scalar, vector
and longitudinal polarisations or subluminal modes that will not be considered here [6, 12].

In the basis {é, é?}, a left-circularly polarised GW travelling in a general g direction
produces a metric perturbation of the form

hij (@ « €i)(4) = [v @ vj (O = viv; , (2.8)

which is the polarisation that we will use throughout this paper, but can be generalised easily
[10].

Although we consider a perturbed metric here, indices should still be understood as
raised and lowered with the Minkowski metric ny, in the (—,+,+,+) convention, as we will
only consider first-order effects. Specifically, this simplifies to the Euclidean metric 5;; as we
are only working with spatial dimensions here.

When considering the decomposition of observables at line-of-sight 71 it is convenient to
align the tangential basis vectors with the geodesic on the sphere connecting the directions ¢
and 7. This avoids unnecessary complications that would follow the introduction of a third,
arbitrary reference direction such as 2. ? This choice of basis about ’® can be defined as

>

i= Wes cerd (2.9)
jo = AX bo (2.9b)
Vl-(a- bs)?

and will be used to decompose astrometric (vector) and shimmering (tensor) observables [10]
(see also [13]). We can easily convert from any coordinate system to this basis using

Aap = bi AiG (2.10a)

ka = Bb: , (2.10b)

where a,b run over the dimensions {6°, 5°} of the plane perpendicular to the line of sight
and i,j run over the dimensions of an arbitrary coordinate system, in particular, Cartesian

coordinates in this case.
Next, we define two spin-1 observables from the astrometric distortion én

46 = On- (bp + ibs), (2.11)

°This choice is particularly useful when considering statistically isotropic SGWBs where the orientation of
the coordinate system should be irrelevant, but can lead to unnecessary algebraic complications.
with a response to a unit amplitude GW

Fy5 = 6h - (bg + iby) , (2.12)

where we note that F,5 has spin s = —1 and F_; has spin s = +1 [1]. Assuming the distortion
effect is small, we can define the linear distortion matrix to describe the shimmering effect
[10

; d(on
Vab = ane = —Kbap + WEan + Sab , (2.18)
and the unit magnitude distortion matrix
~ d(én x
Har = os = —F bab + Fuéap + Sas - (2.14)

In the above, the « (scalar), w (pseudo-scalar), and S$,» (tensor) objects are the irreducible
components of the general w,, tensor under rotations. In particular, S,» is the irreducible

spin-2, symmetric, traceless component that can be represented using spin-weighted variables
[14].

Using this decomposition we define the spin-0 observables & and w with response func-
tions F,, and F,, as well as the spin-2 observables

£7 = —(S11 £iS\2) (2.15)
with response functions
Fay = —(S11 +1512) , (2.16)
where we note that F, has spin s = 2 and F_, has spin s = —2 [10]. In summary, we can
write Wap in the {bg, bs} basis as
ai (prt oer (2.17)
wtityy— —7)/2 —K+ 47+ ~-7)/2

which is the form we use to extract the observables and, equivalently, the response functions.

3  Short-distance response functions

Having defined the observables of interest, we now review the explicit expression of the
distortion vector 6f in the limit where the wavelength of the GW is much longer than the
distance between the object and the observer, i.e. the short-distance limit appropriate for
objects within the solar system, as discussed in [6]. As these objects appear point-like on a
telescope, we will consider a group of them as an extended image, which allows us to define
the distortion matrix. The general expression for the distortion vector, valid in any limit,
was given by [13, 15] and the short-distance limit by [6] as

on’ = shin? (5 — far). (3.1)

Following this, we can derive an expression for the distortion matrix

bij = sty — yu; (+B) — sla : 6)"6;; . (3.4)

We would like to compute the two-point correlation function between the short-distance
observables introduced in Section 2, as measured from tracking of asteroids within the solar
system, and the long-distance redshift effect, as measured from pulsar timing arrays, whose
response function is given by (see, e.g. [16])

(ag (3.5)

Using the approach adopted in [16], we consider a frame where the object being tracked
or imaged is at ” = (6,,¢;) and the left-circularly polarised GW propagates in direction
2=(0=0,¢). In this frame, the short-distance distortion observable response functions are

F_,(2, 2) = —e7?#(¢-%s) cost (5) ; (3.6f)

and the long-distance redshift response is given by

15
F.(é,f) = se — cos Os) « (3.7)
As shown in [10], it is convenient to define scalar quantities using spin-raising and -lowering
operators. This greatly simplifies the calculation of angular correlation functions because it
removes the dependence of the coordinate frame under arbitrary rotations. To this end, we
define spin raising (9) and lowering (@) operators [14, 17]

piP(0,6) = 8 ,f(6,8) sin (0) (54 + iese (8). 3,) sin-*() 5108.9), (3.8a)

a6
.-10(0,6) = 5 ,#(6, 6) = — sin (6) (3 — Fee ox) sin’ (6) ,f(0,6). _(3.8b)

These operators raise or lower the spin-weight of a function ,f(0,¢) with spin s and can
be used to raise or lower the spin-weight of the response functions to spin-0 so that we can
work with purely spin-0 objects that have simple, well-defined transformation properties [17].

These operators map OF, = Frye, PF, = F_¢ and @F_s = F_¢, OF 45 = Fy¢ [10] and
give the spin-0 equivalent functions as

Fc (2, ft) = —38e~74(9-4s) sin? 0, , (3.9a)

Fye(2,A) = Selo) sin? 6, . (3.9b)

We can now expand all response functions in terms of spin-0 (scalar) spherical harmonics

Yim(9s,%s). These restrict the expansion coefficients to m = 2, 1 > 2 due to the e's factor.
Determining the coefficients using overlap integrals and the orthonormality of spherical

harmonics, we find that all short-distance functions give only quadrupole terms (J = 2)

Fx (¢, 03, bs) = eax Y35(0s, 4s) 5 (3.10)

4/ er, ay = 0, as Ay] or and as = 2y/ &, The coefficients for
the long-distance redshift response F, are given by

aj = (—1)'/4n (21 + 1) on (3.11)

and include contributions at all values of | > 2, although these will cancel later when taking
the overlap integrals.

Having found the expansion of the distortion functions in terms of spherical harmonics,
we use their well-defined transformation properties under rotation to find the distortion
functions for a general GW direction defined by rotating the system such that 2 > @

After rotating the functions, we have to invert the raising and lowering procedure to
recover the original spin-1 and spin-2 observables. For this, we can use the identities

The expressions above make explicit the spin dependence of the (spin-2) GW and that of
observables with different spins (0, +1, and +2). Note also that the coordinate frame de-
pendence of the observables with spin-> 0 is now solely incorporated into the spin-weighted
spherical harmonics, which are an explicit form of the generators of rotations on the sphere.
The long-distance limit of the redshift response can also be written in this form [16]

4 Angular Correlation Functions

Having defined the angular response functions for all observables, we can now derive the
angular correlation functions between long-distance redshift z and short-distance observables.
To do this, we consider an observable A with spin s; at position #; = (61,¢1) and another
object measuring observable B with spin sg at position ho = (02,¢2). An SGWB can be
considered as a superposition of Fourier modes

hij (t,x) = > [a [es hp(f, Hej (Derr tera , (4.1)
ae ‘

where ej is the polarisation tensor for a polarisation P defined in Section 2, and we are

summing over left- and right-circular polarisations [20]. The integrals are over the frequencies
f of the GWs in the stochastic spectrum as well as the GW source directions q. In the limit
where the many distant sources are adding incoherently to form the SGWB, we can assume
stationarity and statistical isotropy, in which case the amplitude hp(f, @) for each polarization
can be considered as a Gaussian random variable with

(he(f,) =0, (4.2a)
(he fhe (f.@)) = bpp d(f — £)PG-@)H(f) , (4.2b)
where we have also assumed there is no net polarisation.
We now define two general observables

B

where F4’(q,1) and F#'(g, 2) are the response functions for observables A and B respec-
tively to a unit-magnitude GW with polarisation P.

To find the correlator between the observables, we insert the left-circularly polarised
response functions F¥(q,f1) and F&(g,f2), as stated in (3.16), and place the observer at
the origin by setting x = 0. As we will not be working with the right-circularly polarised
response functions explicitly, we relabel F4(g, 1) and F£(q,’2) to F4(g,f1) and Fp(q, hz).
Ignoring the right-circularly polarised component, we first find the left-circularly polarised
correlator, denoted by subscript v,

where the frequency and angular components factorise when taking the correlator due to
the isotropic property outlined in (4.2), specifically as H(f) does not depend on @ [1]. We
now focus on the angular correlation pattern rae and introduce the unpolarised correlation
function as

where the notation X refers to the equivalent observable to X with opposite spin for ob-
servables with non-zero spin and the same observable as X for observables with zero spin

(4.114)

and plot these in a particular, aligned frame where we choose a value of aj. A natural
choice is a frame where the spin s # 0 object is aligned along the 2 axis such that ag = 0.
However, this only works for the correlation patterns where s1 + s2 is even, as all unpolarised
correlation patterns between observables where s, + s2 is odd, such as [?*9,
the ag = 0 frame. This is because they are related to a representation D*! @ D® of SO(3)
that transforms under parity as P(D® @ D®) = (—1)*1+%2(D" @ D®) = —(D*! @ D*®),
which leads to the contributions cancelling when the left and right circular contributions are
summed. For this reason, we choose the a2 = 0 frame only for the correlators where s1 + s2
is even (T?**, T?” and I*+7) and instead choose the ay = 5 frame for the remaining ones
(r2+8 and Ti), As they give imaginary values, we also scale these by a factor of i. This
is shown in fig. 2.

Note that the dependence on the angle a2 and the associated ambiguity is not in conflict
with our earlier assumption of statistical isotropy and is simply a consequence of the coor-
dinate dependence of spin > 0 variables. A more convenient way to state the correlations is
to use the spin-weighted angular power spectra for each combination. These are coordinate
invariant and any two observers would agree on their value irrespective of what choice of
frame is made in the angular domain. In this case, they are pure quadrupoles

5 Forecasts for Signal-to-Noise and Sensitivity

We now consider forecasts for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of measuring each of the cor-
relation patterns using LSST tracking of solar system asteroids and NANOGrav data for
pulsars [23].

The astrometric measurement of each object, labelled by J, will result in a time-domain
data stream d;(t). This can be Fourier transformed into the frequency domain d;(f) and can

dr(f) =hr(f) +Ar(f), (5.1)

with the GW signal h;(f) and noise ii7(f) [24]. We assume stationarity in the noise, which
means it can be characterised by a diagonal variance in the frequency domain

(ar(P)isr(f')) = Ur OF - fdr, (5.2)

for pairs of uncorrelated objects labelled by J and J.
Following [6] and [25], we define the SNR as

1/AT

SNRAp = (IFA? ?) SOT / tw. (5.3)
LD app

where we are summing over all pairs of objects that are being cross-correlated in the observ-

ables A and B, AT is the cadence of observations, and T’ is the total time of observation.
In our case, the J index labels asteroids in the short-distance limit and the J index

labels pulsars in the long-distance limit. For the GWs, we assume a power-law spectrum

3H2 | (f\7
HUD) = soctit (F) (544)

“In practice, this transformation is complicated by inhomogencous sampling of the object’s positions, but
we make the assumption that a simple Fourier transform will suffice for this initial exploration.

where y = 0 for cosmological sources and y = u for astrophysical sources such as Supermas-
sive Black Hole Binaries, Ho is the Hubble parameter and Qo gives the amplitude of the GW
background [6]. We also assume that the astrometric noise for the asteroids consists purely
of a white spectrum

Last = 724 AT , (5.5)

which means the noise is independent of frequency, whereas for pulsars, we have white and
red noise components

where the white noise component is mY = a wAT, similarly to the asteroid noise, and

the new red noise component is assumed to follow a power law with y®% = —3 and all
other parameters are determined empirically [26]. For the sake of these calculations, we use

Assuming all asteroids and pulsars have similar noise, we can arrive at the expression
for the long-short distance cross-correlation SNR

Again, moving to the frame where a2 = 0 for correlators with s1 + s2 is even and ag = 7 for
the remaining ones, we can compute the average correlation patterns as

where all non-vanishing are of order 1, so we can treat them as equivalent to unity.

There is an important issue arising from the fact that, while grouped into an extended
object, the asteroids themselves are point-like and not genuinely extended. For this reason,
their light flux cannot be integrated properly, as would be the case for other astronomical
objects that appear as genuinely extended, such as galaxies. The effect of this is that the SNR
of the shimmering observables k, w, and +7 is not well-defined. While we still present the

12
computations in principle, it is important to keep in mind that the following considerations
are only strictly correct for the scalar observables +6.
We can now rewrite the SNR from (5.8) in terms of the characteristic strain h,(f) =
fH(f) which follows a power law

he(f) = Aa (4). (5.10)

such that y = 2a and Ag encodes the other constants [27]. Hence, we can find the SNR in
terms of the characteristic strain

again assuming (\[47|?) ~ 1. This allows us to find the total SNR, setting A, = 10" for a
standard background. Our assumed survey parameters are Opy| = 320 ns, gast = 7LssT = 50
mas, T = 5 years, AT = 14 days, Apu = 36, fast = 5 x 10° and a = 0, which corresponds to
a cosmological background [6, 27]. This gives SNRP“! = 2.6 and SNRT° = 1.1 x 1074.

Now we can find a sensitivity curve within the frequency range. We choose SNR = 3 as
a detection limit as done in [27] and find the coefficient Aq for different values of a

where the integral is unfortunately not analytically solvable due to the red component of the
pulsar noise. However, we can divide the frequency range into two sections where red and
white noise dominate respectively, the threshold being denoted by fihresh. Neglecting the
non-dominant contribution, the integral becomes analytically solvable, and the solution can
be expressed as a sum.

We can now write A, as

where Awn = 4a—5 and Argn = 4a — ay —5. For Awn = 0 or Argn = 0, Aa has a
logarithmic dependence on either AT or T, but as we expect some continuous distribution
of values for a in the stochastic background, we can safely ignore these case dues to their
zero measures. This gives a family of parametric curves for he(f,a) by substituting (5.12)
or (5.13) into (5.10) with an envelope as shown in fig. 3. The envelope shows the minimum
characteristic strain that the measurement technique is sensitive to at each frequency and
hence provides a better way to compare different approaches than only using the total SNR.

We notice that the PTA only survey is better than the cross-correlation in the surveyed

frequency range and hence provides a much better overall SNR, as seen above. The main
reasons for this is that PTAs can be measured with a relatively small timing uncertainty of

asteroids with angular resolution dast = OLgsr and cadence AT = 14 days, and two potential

100 ns [5] whereas asteroids are tracked with an angular resolution of 50 mas [9], which is
not ideal even compared to other current surveys such as GAIA that can operate with an
angular resolution of 0.2 mas [28]. Additionally, asteroids are often in unstable orbits with
many external forces acting on them that can distort the data strongly in certain frequency
bands [6].
Hence, we can consider how the variation of the survey parameters for asteroids would
change the sensitivity and overall SNR of the cross-correlation method. In fig. 3, we can
observe how the cross-correlation method make improvements on the PTA only method at
1igh frequencies if asteroids could be tracked with a better angular resolution and cadence.
This could be a promising approach to closing the gap between PTA surveys [5] and LISA [4]
in the spectrum of GWs, especially using measurements at lower cadence that can access more
of these frequencies which is not necessarily possible in practice for PTAs due to technical
imitations [5].
Varying the angular resolution and cadence of the asteroids survey also has an effect on
1e total SNR, and hence the viability for detecting a stochastic GW background. This is
1own in fig. 4.

We can see that increasing the angular resolution of asteroid observations provides
he most promising way for improving the overall SNR of the cross-correlation method.

Different possible survey parameters are shown again, similarly to fig. 3.

This could be technologically viable in the future since other stellar objects can already be
tracked to such precision. Increasing the scanning frequency across the sky is another possible
pathway to a better SNR although this could be less economical due to the need for a larger
telescope or an array of telescopes.

6 Discussion

In this work, we have defined scalar, vector, and tensor observables for solar system objects
in the short-distance limit by grouping asteroids into effective extended images. Using these,
we derived the unpolarised cross-correlation patterns between long-distance pulsar timing
array (PTA) redshift observables and short-distance astrometric observables. The resulting
ong-short cross-correlation patterns simplify considerably: all scalar or scalar-equivalent
observables are described by purely quadrupolar angular correlations, mirroring the struc-
ure of the standard Hellings-Downs-type correlations that appear in both long-long and
short-short pairings.

With present astrometric precision, the achievable signal-to-noise ratio does not yet rival
hat of current PTA-only measurements. However, our analysis indicates that future surveys
capable of higher angular resolution and cadence could make this cross-correlation technique
a viable and complementary approach to probing stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds
SGWBs). Improvements in asteroid tracking precision, in particular, could significantly
enhance sensitivity at higher frequencies where PTA measurements lose efficacy.

A current limitation of the asteroid-grouping approach lies in estimating uncertainties
for the shimmering observables, which cannot be straightforwardly adapted from analyses of
genuinely extended sources such as galaxies. Since asteroid observations yield point-like data

—-15-
rather than integrated light profiles, our signal-to-noise forecasts apply most robustly to the
scalar (spin-1) observables +6, while those involving spin-2 (shimmering) quantities require
more careful error modelling in future work.

Looking ahead, two key advantages emerge from this long-short correlation method.
First, by correlating high-cadence astrometric measurements with precise pulsar timing data,
the technique could probe GW frequencies lying between the PTA and LISA sensitivity
bands—potentially opening a new observational window on the SGWB spectrum. Second,
because the two datasets originate from independent measurement systems—optical astrom-
etry and radio timing—the cross-correlation is naturally robust against correlated instru-
mental systematics and common-mode noise. This property could provide a powerful means
of verifying a stochastic GW signal once independent datasets of sufficient precision become
available.

In summary, while current measurement capabilities limit the practical detectability
of the predicted correlations, the formalism developed here establishes a clear theoreti-
cal framework and quantitative path for exploiting future astrometric-timing synergies in
gravitational-wave cosmology.
