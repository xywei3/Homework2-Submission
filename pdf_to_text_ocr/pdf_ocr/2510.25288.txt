We investigate the capacity of a flat partially reactive patch of arbitrary shape to trap indepen-
dent particles that undergo steady-state diffusion in the three-dimensional space. We focus on the
total flux of particles onto the patch that determines its reactive capacitance. To disentangle the
respective roles of the reactivity and the shape of the patch, we employ a spectral expansion of
the reactive capacitance over a suitable Steklov eigenvalue problem. We derive several bounds on
the reactive capacitance to reveal its monotonicity with respect to the reactivity and the shape.
Two probabilistic interpretations are presented as well. An efficient numerical tool is developed for
solving the associated Steklov spectral problem for patches of arbitrary shape. We propose and
validate, both theoretically and numerically, a simple, fully explicit approximation for the reactive
capacitance that depends only on the surface area and the electrostatic capacitance of the patch.
This approximation opens promising ways to access various characteristics of diffusion-controlled
reactions in general domains with multiple small well-separated patches. Direct applications of these
results in statistical physics and physical chemistry are discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

In many biochemical scenarios, a particle diffuses in a
complex medium and searches for small reactive patches
hat are dispersed on reflecting walls [1-5]. Depend-
ing on the considered application, the reactive patch
can represent an ion channel, an active site or a cat-
alytic germ, a hole, a magnetic impurity, etc. The mean
first-passage time (MFPT) to the patch is often used
o characterize the efficiency of the diffusive search [6—
0]. Starting from the Lord Rayleigh’s seminal result
for the MFPT to a small circular patch on the sphere
11], considerable progress has been achieved in solving
his so-called narrow escape problem [12-21] (see also
overviews in [22, 23]). Among various analytical tools,
one can mention the method of matched asymptotic
expansions [24-31], homogenization techniques [32-37],
constant-flux approximation [38-43], Wiener-Hopf inte-
gral equation [44], as well as conformal mapping in two
dimensions [45, 46]. Other characteristics of diffusion-
controlled reactions [47-52] such as the overall reaction
rate (or the total flux) and splitting probabilities were
also analyzed.

Former works were mainly focused on the idealized sit-
uation of perfectly reactive patches when the reaction
event occurs immediately upon the first contact with the
patch. In other words, the kinetic step of the reaction
event was ignored, by assuming that it occurs much faster
than the diffusion step. However, in most practical set-
tings, once the particle has arrived onto the patch, it has

© overpass an energy activation barrier to react, or an
entropic barrier to squeeze through a hole. In biochem-
istry, a macromolecule has to be in the proper conforma-
ional state to bind its partner, an ion channel has to be
open to pass the arrived ion, and so on. As discussed
in [39], the ignorance of this kinetic step may cause mis-
leading conclusions on the asymptotic behavior of the
mean first-reaction time (MFRT) and other characteris-
ics. The important role of partial reactivity in diffusion-
controlled reactions, first recognized in the seminal work
by Collins and Kimball [53], has been revealed in different
contexts [54-64]. In particular, the asymptotic behavior
of the MFRT on partially reactive targets was shown to
be considerably different from the idealized case of per-
fect reactions [64-66]. Recently, the problem of diffusion-
controlled reactions on multiple small well-separated par-
tially reactive patches in both two and three dimensions
was revisited [67-69]. In particular, the MFRT in three
dimensions was shown to be determined, to the leading
order, by the reactive capacitance, which is proportional
to the flux of particles reacted on the patch and thus
naturally generalizes the electrostatic capacitance to the
case of partial reactivity (see Sec. II for details). For a
circular patch, the reactive capacitance was thoroughly
investigated in [68].

In this paper, we push this analysis to another direc-
tion and investigate the reactive capacitance for patches
of various shapes. First, we deepen the theoretical de-
scription of the reactive capacitance in Sec. II by uncov-
ering its monotonicity properties and probabilistic inter-
pretations. We also get useful bounds on the reactive ca-
pacitance and the principal Steklov eigenvalue. For this
purpose, we reformulate the exterior Steklov problem for
flat patches as an eigenvalue problem for an integral op-
erator with an explicit kernel. Second, we employ this

space.

reformulation to conceive an efficient method for solv-
ing the exterior Steklov problem numerically. Various
numerical results are present in Sec. III. In particular,
we inspect how the Steklov eigenvalues and eigenfunc-
tions depend on the shape of the patch by considering
several families of shapes such as ellipses and rectangles.
We show that the principal eigenfunction provides the
dominant contribution to the reactive capacitance and
validate a simple, fully explicit approximation for this
quantity. Section IV discusses physical implications of
this analysis and concludes the paper by summarizing
the main results and highlighting open questions.

Il. REACTIVE CAPACITANCE

Throughout this paper, we consider a flat partially re-
active bounded patch T of arbitrary shape on the hori-
zontal reflecting plane in the upper half-space R3. (Fig.
1). To avoid eventual mathematical issues on the well-
posedness of the considered problems, we assume that the
boundary of the patch is piecewise smooth. We consider
steady-state diffusion of particles with constant diffusion
coefficient D > 0, concentration Ap > 0 imposed at in-
finity, and reactivity « > 0 on the patch. The concentra-
tion profile in the upper half-space can be expressed as
A(y) = Ao(1—w(y; )), where pp = «/D and the function
w(y; 4) solves the boundary value problem

Aw=0 (yeR4), (la)
Onw+pw=p (yeT), (1b)
dnw=0 (y € OR3\D), (1c)

C(u :
we H+ o('y?) Uivl-ro0), (aa)
where y = (y1,¥y2,y3) and 0, = —Oy, is the normal

derivative. The coefficient C(j:) in the far-field behavior
of the solution is called the reactive capacitance of the
patch [. More explicitly, the divergence theorem yields

Clu) = x | Onte)ay, (2
A eg

i.e., C() is proportional to the flux of particles onto a
partially reactive patch T. In the limit 4p — oo, one re-

trieves the electrostatic capacitance (also known as har-
monic or Newtonian capacity) of the patch T [70], as if it
was perfectly reactive (absorbing). Note that the solution
w can be extended to the lower half-space by symmetry
so that the considered setting is actually equivalent to a
“two-sided” patch in the whole space, without the aux-
iliary Neumann condition (1c). However, as the patch is
flat (of zero thickness), it is more convenient to deal with
the problem (1) in the upper half-space.

Even for a circular patch, there is no explicit solution of
the boundary value problem (1). In order to investigate
the dependence of the reactive capacitance on the reac-
tivity parameter 4 and the patch shape, we will employ
spectral expansions, variational formulations, probabilis-
tic interpretations and numerical analysis.

A. Exterior Steklov problem

In order to obtain a spectral expansion of the reactive
capacitance, we consider the exterior Steklov problem in
the upper half-space R3, which consists in finding the
eigenpairs {j1,, U;,} that satisfy [68]

AV, =0 (yeR), (3a)
OnVe = eUe (yer), (3b)
On¥, =0 (y € OR3\L), (3c)

This is a special case of the Steklov eigenvalue problem
for the exterior of a compact domain [71-73], which is
known to have a discrete spectrum, i.e., a countable set
of eigenvalues jz, that can be enumerated by an integer
index k = 0,1,... in an increasing order:

0<po Swi <... ZA +00. (4)

The first eigenvalue jz is simple and strictly positive,
whereas the associated eigenfunction Vo does not change
sign. The restrictions of the Steklov eigenfunctions onto
the patch T, U;|r, form a complete orthonormal basis of
the L?(L) space of square-integrable functions on T:

/ Ve(y) Ver(y)dy = See (5)
rT

(see [74-76] for a broad overview of spectral properties
of the conventional interior Steklov problem).

To gain a more practical insight onto this spectral
problem, let us introduce the Green’s function G(y, y’)
in the upper half-space RS with Neumann boundary con-
dition on the horizontal plane OR}:

-AG(y,y') =d(y-y') (ye Ri), (6a)
nGly.y') =0 (ye OR’), (6b)
Giy,y') +0 (|y| > 00), (6c)
where 6(y—y’) is the Dirac distribution. By the method
of images, one gets immediately

1 1 1
Gly, y’ | — |, ih
wy) ae 7a) 7)

where y’ is the mirror reflection of y’ with respect to the
horizontal plane. Multiplying Eq. (3a) by G(y, y’), mul-
tiplying Eq. (6a) by U;.(y), subtracting these equations,
integrating them over y € R3, using the Green’s formula
and the boundary conditions, one finds

Ue (y") = mn / Gly.yWUelydy (y! RR). (8)

Restricting y’ to I’, one can introduce an integral opera-
tor G, acting on a continuous function f(y) on T as

(Gf) (y )= [esa y')dy’, (9)

with the kernel

1
Gy. y') = Say yl wy eT, yA#y') (10)
(even though the operator G is formally defined on the
space of continuous functions, it can be extended to
L? (I) space via embedding theorems, see [77] for details).
Since the kernel G(y, y’) is symmetric and weakly singu-
lar, G is a self-adjoint compact operator [77]; moreover,
if T was replaced by the whole plane R*, G would be
the Riesz potential of order 1 [78], which is known to be
positive definite (this is a direct corollary of the Fourier
transform representation of Riesz potentials, see [79]).
As a consequence, there is an infinite sequence of posi-
tive eigenvalues, enumerated by the index k = 0,1,2,...
that accumulate to 0, whereas the associated eigenfunc-
tions form an orthonormal basis of L?([). Rewriting Eq.

(8) as

1
GUy|p = —Vy|p (k =0,1,2,...), (11)
Mk

one sees that 1/u, and W;|p are the eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions of G. This is an alternative way to access
the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Steklov prob-
lem (3); note that once V,|p is found, its extension to the
upper half-space follows immediately from Eq. (8). We
finally stress that the integral operator G is the inverse
of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator associated to the
exterior Steklov problem (3).

This reformulation reduces the original three-
dimensional problem in the unbounded domain (the
upper half-space) to an equivalent eigenvalue problem
for the integral operator G with the explicit kernel on the
two-dimensional bounded patch I. Note that a modified
integral equation with the kernel (10), in which the
right-hand side is a constant, was employed by Bernoff

and Lindsay to investigate diffusive capture rates for
an array of perfectly reactive circular patches [30].
The eigenvalue problem (11) will serve us to develop
an efficient numerical tool for computing the Steklov
eigenfunctions (see Appendix A). Moreover, it yields a
variational (minimax) characterization of the Steklov
eigenvalues [77]

for test functions u and u, from L?(L) of the unit L?(P)-
norm. This variational form implies the domain mono-
tonicity property:

Trcls = p>yp? (k=0,1,...). (13)
This property can be shown by a standard construction,
namely, by using a test function u(y), which is equal to

the k-th eigenfunction vi (y) for y € T; and 0 otherwise:

where the last inequality follows from the minimax char-
acterization (12b).

We emphasize that the domain monotonicity property
does not hold for the Steklov problem in a more general
setting of the exterior of a compact set. For instance, if T
is an oblate spheroidal surface with semi-axes a, a,b, the
domain monotonicity property (13) fails, as illustrated
in Fig. 7 of [80], which shows the non-monotonous de-
pendence of the principal Steklov eigenvalue on the as-
pect ratio a/b. This example highlights that the domain
monotonicity property for patches strongly relies on the
flatness of these domains.

B. Spectral expansion and basic properties

Since the Steklov eigenfunctions W,|r form the or-
thonormal basis of L?(I'), they can be used to expand
w(y; )|r and thus to determine the normal derivative of
w(y; 1). Substituting this expansion into Eq. (2), one
gets the spectral representation of the reactive capaci-
tance (see [68, rs for details)

9 He + Be
(14)

By expanding a constant function on the basis of eigen-
functions ;|p, one can easily check that

oo
SOR =1, (15)
k=0

so that the coefficient Fj, > 0 of the spectral expansion
(14) can be interpreted as the relative contribution of
the k-th Steklov eigenfunction to the reactive capacitance
C(u). In particular, the Fo characterizes the closeness of
the principal eigenfunction Vo to a constant. A similar
spectral expansion was earlier derived for the spectro-
scopic impedance of an electrochemical cell, though in a
slightly different mathematical setting [82].
Evaluating the derivative of C(j),

a - Hs" HF

one sees that C(j1) is a monotonously growing function
of yz for all » > 0. A Taylor expansion of C'(js) around 0
reads

C(u) = ~ Yeal- Bw)”,

In [68], alternative representations for the first three co-
efficients were derived:

In the following, we will also employ the notation:

: [ody = / Gly, y')dydy’. (20)

Ac= TP

xr

This constant, re-emerging in various contexts [66], will
play an important role in the analysis of the reactive
capacitance; note that ec, = Ap|I'|?/(27).

In the opposite limit of large , Eq. (14) yields the
ectral expansion for the electrostatic capacitance:

w

rs
= on aan (21)
k=0

(here we employ the convention that the capacitance of
a ball of radius R is equal to R).

If the patch is dilated by a factor a, ie., IY = al,
the Steklov eigenvalues are rescaled by 1/a, pj, = pe/o,
F;, remain unchanged, so that the reactive capacitance
of the rescaled patch reads

C'(p) = aC(ap). (22)

C. Alternative spectral expansion

The reactive capacitance C(j:) admits an alternative
spectral expansion, which is based on the eigenpairs
{uy , UN (y)} of the following exterior Steklov problem:

Avy =0 (ye R%), (23a)
OnVE =p UY (y eT), (23b)
On¥f =0 (ye ORS\T), (23c)
ly|?|VEN| +0 (ly| > 00). (23d)

While the decay condition (3d) could be interpreted as a
Dirichlet condition at infinity, the decay of the gradient
of an eigenfunction in Eq. (23d) can be understood as
a Neumann condition at infinity (that is reflected by the
superscript ’N’). The latter condition was studied in [83—
87] in the context of sloshing or ice-fishing problems in
hydrodynamics (see also [88, 89] and references therein);
moreover, the eigenpairs {uy ; WN } naturally appear in
the asymptotic analysis of the mixed Steklov-Neumann
problem [66, 68]. In Appendix A, we present an efficient
numerical tool to solve the spectral problem (23).

The distinction between the spectral problems (3) and
(23) becomes clearer from the form of their asymptotic
decay at infinity. For instance, in the exterior of a ball,
a general isotropic solution of the Laplace equation is a
linear combination cy + cp/|y| with arbitrary constants
cn and cp. The Dirichlet condition (3d) imposes cy = 0,
whereas the Neumann condition (23d) imposes cp = 0.
For general domains (including the case of flat patches),
the chosen Dirichlet or Neumann condition fixes the far-
field behavior of the solution.

In analogy to the spectral problem (3), the spectrum
of the mixed Steklov-Neumann problem (23) is discrete,
with a countable set of eigenvalues, which can be enu-
merated by the index k in increasing order

O= ny <p <p) <... 7 +00. (24)

The restrictions of eigenfunctions onto the patch, wy Ir,
form a complete orthonormal basis of L?([). Note that
the principal eigenvalue pi’ = 0 is associated to the con-
stant eigenfunction UY = ST AVAINE and all other eigen-
functions are orthogonal to it.

The following spectral expansion was derived in [68]:

In this subsection, we discuss the complementary insights
onto the reactive capacitance that can be gained from this
expansion.

D. Sigmoidal approximation and several bounds
Neglecting the positive sum in Eq. (25), one gets im-
mediately the lower bound:

1 Lin 1
O(n) ~ = G(x) HIP] CapP(ys) ”

(26)
Rewriting the right-hand side of this bound as

1 C(o)

app
on) = p+ 2nC(co)/|P|’

(27)

we retrieve the sigmoidal approximation for the reactive
capacitance. This relation was proposed in [68] as an
empirical approximation that correctly reproduces both
small-z and large-y limits of C(j). In turn, it follows here
directly from the spectral expansion (25) by neglecting
its last term, thus allowing one to control its accuracy
(see below). Note that a similar approximation appeared
in [90] in the analysis of the principal eigenvalue of the
Laplace operator with Robin boundary condition, as well
as in [37, 65]. In the special case of a circular patch, the
approximation (27) was shown to be accurate over the
entire range of within the maximal relative error of
4% [68]. One of the aims of the present work consists in
extending this result to patches of arbitrary shape. For
this purpose, we need to compute numerically the Steklov
eigenvalues ju, and the spectral weights Fy, (see Sec. III).
To obtain an upper bound on 1/C(), one can rewrite

We also note that the sum evaluated in Eq. (29) gives
the upper bound on the absolute error of the sigmoidal

Dividing this relation by C*PP(j:), we get the maximal

CPP (wu) — C(u) Enns (34)
Clu) ~ 1+ 2nC(co)/(uIT|)’
with
Emax = 2mApC(oo) — 1. (35)

One sees that the upper bound monotonously increases
with y and reaches the maximum Emax at UW = oo.
However, the actual relative error decreases in the limit
jt > co because C(j) approaches to its limit C(co), and
the sigmoidal approximation correctly captures this be-
havior. As a consequence, the value Emax is expected to
be a conservative over-estimation. Using the spectral ex-
pansions (17, 21), one can represent the maximal bound

According to Eq. (15), one sees that if Fo is close to 1,
the dominant contributions to two sums are pio Fo and
F/o respectively, and the maximal bound is close to 0.

The bounds (32) can be further improved. For in-
stance, rewriting Eq. (30) as

one can neglect the last sum to obtain the improved lower

was expressed in terms of c; from Eq. (18) via the Taylor
expansion (17). Repeating this trick, one can get more
and more accurate bounds that include, however, higher-
order Taylor coefficients cn.
E. Probabilistic interpretations

From a physical point of view, the reactive capacitance
is proportional to the flux of particles diffusing from in-
finity, as stated earlier. In this subsection, we provide
several probabilistic interpretations of C(j:) that will al-
low us to establish its additional properties.

Let W; be the standard Brownian motion in R® with
diffusion coefficient D, that starts from a fixed point y at
ime 0. The reflected Brownian motion X;, in the upper
1alf-space RS can simply be obtained by reflecting any
random path W, with respect to the horizontal plane
y3 = 0; in other words, X; = (W/,W?,|W?|), where W;
are three independent components of W,. To incorporate
artial reactivity of the patch I’, we follow the encounter-
sed approach [64]. For this purpose, we introduce the
oundary local time £; on I’ as the limit of the rescaled

residence time wo of X;, up to time t, in a thin boundary
ayer of thickness o near [:

t
. D
_ lim 9 = = [ee — |X, —T)dt’, (40)
0

where O(z) is the Heaviside step function: O(z) = 1 for
z > 0, and 0 otherwise. We note that both ¢, and go)
have units of length, despite their name. The bound-
ary local time @; can also be interpreted as the rescaled
number of arrivals of X; onto T up to time t. By con-
struction, ¢; is a nondecreasing stochastic process, with
fo = 0. Since the reflected Brownian motion in R3 is
ransient, its ability to revisit the patch is limited so
nat the boundary local time ¢; has a finite (random)
imit @,, as t + oo. Let us denote its probability density
Y Poo (lly).
At each arrival onto the patch I’, the diffusing parti-
cle modeled by reflected Brownian motion may react and
nus disappear. For a constant reactivity parameter p,
he reaction event is triggered when the number of ar-
rivals (i.e., failed reaction attempts), represented by ¢;,

exceeds a random threshold ¢ that obeys the exponential
distribution: P{@ > ¢} = e~#® (see [64] for details). In
his way, the first-reaction time (FRT) on the patch T is
defined as the first-crossing time of the threshold é by £;:
7 =inf{t>0 : & <Q. Since the reflected Brownian
motion in RS is transient, there is a finite probability of
escaping to infinity without reacting on the patch; in this
case, the FRT is infinite: 7 = +o0. In turn, the prob-
ability of the reaction event, Py{7 < +00}, is known to
satisfy Eq. (1) and is thus given by w(y; 14). We conclude
that the auxiliary function w(y; 4) admits a simple inter-
pretation as the probability of reaction on the patch [
with the reactivity parameter jz, when the starting point
is y. Inturn, 1—w(y; 1) is the escape probability without
reaction. We also note that the reaction time 7 is finite
if and only if the limit ¢, is above the threshold @, i.e.,
the reaction event {r < +00} is identical to {l. > 0}.

As a consequence, we get

where we integrated by parts. We conclude that 1 —
w(y; ) is the moment-generating function of the random
variable 0...

In the last step, we consider the situation when the
starting position of the particle is not fixed but randomly
chosen on the patch with the uniform density. The asso-
ciated escape probability reads

dy _ 2rO(u)

oy AMM (an
ry ary

Pou) = f= wey)

where we used the boundary condition (1b), the diver-
gence theorem, and the asymptotic behavior (1d) at in-
finity (the subscript o refers to the uniform distribution
of the starting point on I’). Inverting this relation, one
can express the reactive capacitance C'(j.) in terms of the
escape probability on the patch. In turn, using Eq. (41),
we can relate C(j:) to the moment-generating function:

ty — 2C(H)
E.feM}= acl (43)

where
Bem y= [Byfe} (as)

corresponds to the uniform starting point on the patch.
Comparing this expression with the Taylor expansion
(17), we get an interesting probabilistic interpretation of
the Taylor coefficients c,, as the moments of the boundary
local time ¢..:

E.{@,} = mes (n=0,1,...). (45)

For instance, we retrieve c; = |[|/(27) at n = 0, whereas
cg is proportional to the mean boundary local time.
Moreover, substituting the spectral expansion (14) into
Eq. (43) and performing the inverse Laplace transform
with respect to pz, one gets the probability density of (45:

poo(tle) = > a Fre te’ (46)
k=0

(see [64, 91] for further discussions on such spectral rep-
resentations).
An alternative probabilistic interpretation of C(j:) can
be deduced by multiplying Eq. (1a) by w(y;00), Eq. (la)
with ps = 00 by w(y; 4), subtracting and integrating these
equations over y € Ri, and using the Green’s formula,
boundary conditions and the behavior at infinity:

J etusn)2nulysco)ay = [ evwtwsay = nC (pn).

(47)

Dividing this expression by 21C (oo), we get

C
Pau) = [wlumntady =F, (as)

where
1

Ay) = BaC(o) Or OO) Ir (49)

can be interpreted as the (conditional) harmonic measure
density for a particle arriving from infinity, ie., h(y)dy
is the probability of the first arrival onto the patch T ina
dy vicinity of the point y € T. In other words, h(y) is the
normalized flux density of particles from infinity. In this
light, the integral in Eq. (48) can be interpreted as the
probability of reaction for the process that has managed
to arrive from infinity onto the patch.

F. Domain monotonicity

The electrostatic capacitance C(oo) is known to sat-
isfy the domain monotonicity property (see [70, 78] for
details):

fly Clg. = Cy(co) < Co(co), (50)
ie., the larger patch has the larger trapping ability. This
property is an immediate consequence of the classical
variational formulation of the electrostatic capacitance,
which can be defined for compact sets (including the case
of flat. patches) as

C(oo) = zint{ | |Vul?dy : we OS (R%), ulp > i},

where C§°(R®) is the space of smooth functions in R*
with a compact support, and the factor 47 is included to
ensure our convention that the electrostatic capacitance
of a ball of radius R is R; a similar definition can be
written for the upper half-space. Note that the functional
space C§° can be replaced by the Sobolev space H1(R*)
with appropriate restrictions.

It is intuitively appealing that the same statement
should hold for partially reactive patches, i.e., a larger
patch captures diffusing particles more efficiently. In this
subsection, we establish this domain monotonicity prop-
erty and some other monotonicity relations.

First monotonicity relation

For this purpose, we first derive another representation
of C(y) by setting w(y; 4) = 1—w(y; 1), which satisfies

Aw=0 (ye€R%), (52a)
Ont + po=0 (yeT), (52b)
Ont =0 (y € AR \P), (52c)

Multiplying this equation by w and integrating over R3,
we get

where we used the Green’s formula to integrate by parts,
the Robin boundary condition (52b), and the behavior
(52d) at infinity. As a consequence, we have

CW) = me | [Vul? dy +1 | (way), (63)

where we returned to the original function w(y; 11).
Following the standard arguments, one can recast this
relation in a variational form:

1

Cn) Fe acdtys (| Wuau +o [( u) u}

(54)
The variational formulation immediately implies the do-
main monotonicity property for the reactive capacitance:

IT clg = Ci(u)<Co(u) Vu>o, (55)

where C}(j1) and C2(j) refer to the reactive capacitances
of Ty; and [2, respectively. Indeed, as one searches the
infimum over the same functional space, any reduction
of the patch diminishes the second term in Eq. (54) and
thus the associated Cj(). This is an extension of Eq.
(50) to a finite reactivity yp > 0.

Second monotonicity relation

In the same vein, one can multiply Eq. (1a) by w(y; 1)
and then integrating over R3 to get:

0= ic Aw dy = - f uP ay + [ wanwdy

that

We have thus

and thus yields the second domain monotonicity prop-
erty:

This property could alternatively be obtained from the
probabilistic interpretation. For any fixed y and jp, the
boundary local time on the larger patch I) is greater
than or equal to the boundary local time on the smaller
patch, so that the first-reaction time on [2 is smaller and
thus the particle has more chances to react with 2 before
escaping to infinity. As a consequence, one has

Third monotonicity relation

Next, we establish another monotonicity relation. For
this purpose, let us consider the auxiliary function

where h(y) was defined in Eq. (49). Since w decays
faster than 1/|y|, the divergence theorem implies

from which the boundary condition (64b) yields

have

To evaluate the last term, we multiply Eq. (64a) by
w(y; co), multiply Eq. (la) with pp = oo by w(y; w), sub-
tract them, integrate over R3, use the Green’s formula,
boundary conditions and the decay at infinity to get

Fourth monotonicity relation

From the last inequality, let us deduce a weaker yet
more appealing monotonicity property. Denoting n; =
|Ti|/Ci(u) — 1/Ci(co)), we rewrite Eq. (69) as

mm — 27/H) — n2(n2 — 27/1)
mS Cal i

or, equivalently,

(m= 7/uy? = 7? 0? (ne = 1 / pm) = [ne

(71)

Since |[;| < |[2], multiplication of two inequalities
yields, after few simplifications,

Im —7/p| < |In2— 7/p- (72)

Since 7; > 27/j. due to Eq. (25), we conclude that 1 <
No, Le.,

This inequality allows one to control the large-reactivity
behavior of the reactive capacitance.

G. Large-reactivity limit

When the reactivity parameter jy goes to infinity, the
reactive capacitance C(j:) approaches its limit C(oo).
However, the behavior of the reactive capacitance is not
analytic at infinity. In fact, according to Eq. (2), the
reactive capacitance is the integral of the flux density,
which may diverge at the boundary of the patch in the
Dirichlet setting. This is well-known for an elliptic patch
with semiaxes a < 6, for which the flux density is given
by (see, e.g., [94])

(1 = y/o? — y3/0?) 0?
aK (\/1 — a?/b?)

where K(z) is the complete elliptic integral of the first
kind:

Onw(y; 00) |r (74)

x/2
do
K(z)= / ih (75)
J V1 — 22 sin? 0

The effect of this singular behavior onto the mean first-
reaction time on a circular patch was analyzed in [44] by
using a Wiener-Hopf integral equation. Relying on this
analysis, the large-y asymptotic behavior of the reactive
capacitance for the unit disk was deduced in [68]:

Co(p) & Co(oo) — Binge) yd) (woo), (76)

ied)

where 7 ¥ 0.5772... is the Euler constant, C.(co) = 2/7,
and subscript o refers to the unit disk. The presence of
the logarithm makes this expression non-analytic. Does
this behavior hold for noncircular patches?

While a systematic analysis of this problem for arbi-
trary patches remains an open problem, we argue here
that the non-analytic large-j, behavior is a generic fea-
ture of flat patches. For this purpose, we first rewrite

1 1

_ n(n) +7+1
Co(H)

C.(00) Qu

(u > 00). (77)

This relation can now be used as a bound according to
the monotonicity relation (73). In fact, for any given
patch I, one can inscribe a small disk [9 of radius rp. As
To CT, one has

Tro 1 a. 1 dL.
iy (on - ax) <a ey

where we used the rescaling relation (22). Even though
the asymptotic relation (77) is not a bound, one can add
an additional prefactor to turn it into a bound for large
L, i.e.,

In(2rou) +Y +1 1 il
pee oa toh (79)
with some constant 6 > 0. We conclude that the dif-
ference in the right-hand side cannot vanish faster than
In(u)/p, i.e., the logarithmic singularity is also expected
at infinity, as for the circular patch. A further work is
needed to characterize this behavior more accurately.

The non-analytic behavior of C'(j) is tightly related to
the divergence of the sum of coefficients [V,V(oo)]?. In
fact, the above asymptotic behavior, together with the
spectral expansion (25), implies that

1 1 = HR (00)?
ML - Qn x In(u oo
(aay aa) Darr arena
(80)
as 44 — oo. This divergence suggests that their partial
sum also diverges logarithmically:

Swi (co)P x(k) (K + ox). (81)
k=1

It is instructive to give an alternative insight. For this
purpose, let us multiply Eq. (23a) by w(y;0o), Eq. (la)
by WN (y), subtract them, integrate over R34 and use the
boundary conditions and the asymptotic behavior at in-
finity to get

WN (00) = | h(y) WY (y)dy, (82)
where h(y) is defined by Eq. (49). Since {WN} form a
complete basis of L?([), one can formally write

oo

(wR (oy? = f dyrhtan) [dye h(ys)
» k | 1 1 | 2 ‘2
x 2 WY (Wi) (2) = [es 12(y) = 00.
k=0 r
=d(y1—y2)

In other words, the squared harmonic measure density di-
verges logarithmically due to the edge singularity. This
is exemplified by Eq. (74) that provides an explicit form
of h(y) for elliptic patches. In summary, even though
the coefficients [Wj (oo)]? determine the relative contri-
butions of the Steklov eigenfunctions UY to the reac-
tive capacitance via Eq. (25), in analogy to the coeffi-
cients F, in Eq. (14), the latter are summed to 1 that
facilitates their interpretation as relative weights of the
Steklov eigenfunctions U,.

H. Bounds for the principal eigenvalue

While there were numerous studies on isoperimetric
inequalities for Steklov eigenvalues in the conventional
setting of interior domains (see [74—76] and references
therein), much less is known about the exterior Steklov
problem [73, 92]. Moreover, the assumptions on the reg-
ularity of the boundary that were used in former works,
do not necessarily hold for flat patches. For instance, a
circular patch can be seen as the limit of thinning oblate
spheroids, whose curvature diverges (the edge singular-
ity). To fulfill this gap, we briefly mention some inequal-
ities that follow from our spectral expansions, without
retending for rigorous proofs.

Since 4, and F; are positive, one can use the spectral
expansion (21) to recover the Payne’s upper bound for
he principal eigenvalue jig [93]:

(83)

n a similar way, one can substitute fo < pz, into the
spectral representations (17) of the Taylor coefficients cy,

Moreover, keeping only the first term in the spectral ex-
pansion (17), one gets the lower bound:

FIT) \i/n
10> ( 0 -) ; n=1,2,..., (85)

27 Cn41

n=1,2,.... (84)

which is less explicit as it includes the spectral coefficient
Fo. For instance, one has for n = 1
Fo 1
<HoS :
Ap|C| Ap|T|

(86)

with Ap being defined in Eq. (20). Alternatively, the
inequality (85) can be seen as an upper bound on Fo:

one n

or, equivalently,
[ % < Vf 2ren 41H , n=1,2,... (88)

To illustrate these bounds, let us consider the circu-
lar patch of unit radius, for which the first three Taylor
coefficients were obtained in [68]:

(89)
where E(x) is the complete elliptic integral of the sec-
ond kind. Substituting the values of C(co) = 2/7, c2
and c3 into Eqs. (83, 84), we get three upper bounds:
1.263 (Payne’s bound), 1.178 (n = 1), and 1.170 (n = 2),
whereas the numerical value of the principal eigenvalue
is 1.159. One sees that the bound becomes tighter as n
increases, as expected from the spectral form (21). Using
the numerical value Fo ~ 0.978, we get the lower bounds
1.152 and 1.157, where the last value is very close to the
numerical value of fg. We recall that c2 and c3 for ar-
bitrary patches are expressed via Eq. (18) in terms of
the function wr(a) from Eq. (19). In Appendix B, we
compute Ap for rectangular and elliptic patch
latter case, we also compare the upper bounds (83) and

(86).

I. Relation to the patch shape

To gain further insights onto the relation between the
reactive capacitance of the patch and its geometric shape,
one needs to solve the exterior Steklov problem (3). In
Appendix A, we develop an efficient numerical approach,
which relies on the reformulation (11) of the original
problem. This is a finite-element method, which employs
linear basis functions on a triangular mesh on the patch.
The key step to achieve good accuracy and rapidity of
the method is a semi-analytical representation of the in-
tegral kernel G(y, y’) on these basis functions. The ac-
curacy of the method, which is controlled by the mesh
size, was validated by considering the circular patch, for
which an alternative very accurate approach based on
oblate spheroidal coordinates is available [80].

Using this numerical tool, we aim at answering the
following questions:

(i) How does anisotropy of the patch affect the Steklov
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions?

(ii) Does the principal eigenfunction Vo always provide
the dominant contribution to the reactive capacitance?

(iii) What is the accuracy of the empirical approxima-
tion (27) for different patches?

Ill. NUMERICAL RESULTS
A. Steklov eigenpairs

Since the Steklov eigenfunctions determine the reac-
tive capacitance, it is instructive to first inspect their
behavior for different patches. We start with the circu-
lar patch as a standard benchmark example, and then
explore other patch shapes.

Yircular patch

Figure 2 presents the first 9 Steklov eigenfunctions
W,|r on the circular patch of unit radius. The asso-
ciated eigenvalues ju, and weights F;, are shown in the
panels. As discussed in Appendix A 3 (see also [80]), the
axial symmetry of the problem implies that the eigen-
functions can be written in polar coordinates (r,¢) as
e*'™y,, n(r), with positive integer m and n. For any
m # 0, a linear combination of two non-axially sym-
metric eigenfunctions eu, ,(r) and eum »(r) is
also an eigenfunction, implying that the associated eigen-
value is at least twice degenerate. This is confirmed by
the shape of the shown eigenfunctions (which are cho-
sen to be real-valued), e.g., UY; and WV» correspond to
the same eigenvalue. Our numerical results suggest that
the eigenvalues corresponding to axially symmetric eigen-
functions are simple, whereas the eigenvalues correspond-
ing to non-axially symmetric eigenfunctions are twice de-
generate. We stress that only axially symmetric eigen-

functions (here, with indices k = 0 and k = 5) do con-
tribute to the reactive capacitance C(j.) because the pro-
jection of any non-axially symmetric eigenfunction onto
a constant is zero.

Elliptic patches

The trapping capacity of a perfectly reactive elliptic
patch was studied by Strieder [94]. In particular, the
exact solution of Eq. (1) at 4 = oo, that determines
the concentration profile w(y; oo) in the upper half-space,
was given in ellipsoidal coordinates (see also [95]), from
which the flux density in Eq. (74) follows. Integrating
this density over the patch, one retrieves the electrostatic
capacitance [70]:

b

Unfortunately, these analytical results do not admit ex-
plicit extensions to partially reactive elliptic patches. In
turn, one can express the flux density and the reactive
capacitance in terms of the Steklov eigenfunctions.
Figure 3 presents the first 9 eigenfunctions V;|r and
related eigenvalues jz; for an elliptic patch with semiaxes
1 and 0.5. In contrast to the circular patch, all shown
eigenvalues are simple, i.e., anisotropy generally removes
the degeneracy of eigenvalues. At the same time, the
continuous dependence of the eigenvalues on the aspect
ratio a/b allows one to construct ellipses, for which some
eigenvalues are degenerate (e.g., the shown eigenvalues
2 and pz are close, and they can be made equal by

varying a/b). The symmetry of the elliptic patch implies
hat some eigenfunctions are antisymmetric with respect
o the horizontal or vertical axis, so that their projec-
ion onto a constant is zero. Such antisymmetric eigen-
functions do not contribute to the reactive capacitance.
Among the shown eigenfunctions, only Up, U3, U7 and
Ws do contribute to C(), with their relative weights:
Fo © 0.9741, Fy © 0.0138, Fy = 0.0074 and Fg © 107°.
One sees that, as for the circular patch, the first eigen-
function Vo provides the dominant contribution of 97%.

We complete this discussion by illustrating the differ-
ence between the Steklov problems (3) and (23). Figure
4 presents the first 9 eigenfunctions U}’|p for the ellip-
tic patch of semiaxes 1 and 0.5. Their comparison with
anels of Fig. 3 indicates that, apart from the principal
eigenfunctions Yo and WW, which are substantially dif-
ferent, the other eigenfunctions look quite similar, up to
matching their indices. Moreover, antisymmetric eigen-
functions are actually identical, up to their signs, e.g.
WN = -W,, WN = —Wpy, etc. This is not surprising
(see Appendix A for details): as the kernels G(y, y’) and
GN (y,y’) differ by a function wr(y)/|P| + wr(y’)/|L| -
Ar, which is symmetric on the elliptic patch, the anti-
symmetric eigenfunctions of these kernels should be iden-
tical.

Rectangular patches

Figures 5 and 6 present similar results for a quadratic
patch (—1,1) x (—1,1) and for an elongated rectangular
patch (—1,1) x (—0.2,0.2). As in the case of a circular
patch, symmetries of the square make some eigenvalues

degeneracy is generally removed for rectangular patches,
even though continuous variations of a/b can be used to
obtained some degenerate eigenvalues.
Disconnected patches

To give a broader view onto the spectral properties, we
also discuss the case of disconnected patches. In sharp
contrast to Laplacian eigenfunctions, for which the con-
nectivity of the domain plays the crucial role, it is less rel-
evant for the considered Steklov problem. For instance,
splitting a patch into two disconnected subsets by a curve
has no effect onto the spectrum. Moreover, since the ker-
nel G(y,y’) decays slowly with the distance between y
and y’, even if two subsets are separated by a significant
istance, they still compete with each other for capturing
iffusing particles. This long-range interaction, known as
iffusional screening [96-99] or diffusive interaction [100],
implies that the electrostatic capacitance is not additive,
i.e., the capacitance of the union of two patches is always
smaller than the sum of their individual capacitances.
For perfect reactions, this competition for the case of
wo circular patches on the reflecting plane was charac-
erized analytically in [101, 102], whereas Lindsay and
Bernoff derived asymptotic formulas in the case of mul-
iple small circular patches [29] (see also [36]). A further
extension to partially reactive patches of arbitrary shape
was given in [69]. It is therefore instructive to inspect
he behavior of the Steklov eigenfunctions in the case of
disconnected patches.

Figure 7 shows the first 15 Steklov eigenfunctions Up
for two circular patches of radii 1 and 0.5, separated by
distance 0.5. Interestingly, the presence of the smaller
atch has only a minor effect on the principal eigenvalue
fo and the spectral weight Fo of the associated eigen-
‘unction. We also note that, despite the proximity of two
atches, some eigenfunctions are localized on one patch
(i.e., they almost vanish on the other). The refined struc-
ure of the Steklov eigenpairs gives access to the reactive
capacitance and its dependence on the spatial arrange-
ment of the disconnected patches. Further analysis of
his problem presents an interesting perspective of this
work.

B. Effect of patch anisotropy onto the eigenvalues

To investigate more quantitatively the role of patch
anisotropy, we inspect three families of patches: (i) el-
ipses of semi-axes a and 8, (ii) rectangles (—a, a) x(—b, b),
and (iii) rhombuses with diagonals 2a and 2b. The patch
surface areas are respectively ab, 4ab, and 2ab. We fix
b = 1 and then change the anisotropy by varying a from 0
o 1. In the limit a — 0, all three shapes approach the in-
erval (—1,1), which is inaccessible to three-dimensional
Brownian motion and thus presents a singular limit.

We first inspect the asymptotic behavior of the eigen-
values j1;, for an elliptic patch as a — 0. Since the elliptic
atch shrinks to an interval, the eigenvalues are expected
o diverge as a + 0. The principal eigenvalue jo cannot
diverge faster than the right-hand side of the Payne’s in-

with the coefficients obtained from a linear fit (shown by
dashed line).

To our knowledge, there is no analytic expression for
the capacitance of a rectangular patch. For this reason,
we employ the asymptotic behavior (B8) of the coefficient
Ar for elongated rectangles (see Appendix B). According
to the lower and upper bounds (86), the asymptotic be-
havior of Ap is expected to control that of the principal
eigenvalue jig. Substituting Eq. (B8) into Eq. (86), we
get approximately

or, equivalently,

(95)
Figure 8 presents by squares the left-hand side of this
relation, with jo obtained numerically. A linear fit of
these values is shown by solid line and yields 1/(ajig) *
0.63 In(b/a) + 0.83, in an excellent agreement with our
prediction (95).

A similar asymptotic analysis could be performed for
rhombic patches. However, we skip this analysis and just
present a linear fit of 1/(ayo) versus In(b/a), obtained
from numerical values of jg and shown in Fig. 8 by
dash-dotted line:

1
— ® 0.52 In(b/a) + 0.45

(a<b). (96)

In all three cases, the asymptotic behavior is similar
ut the coefficients are slightly different. We outline that
he numerical results in Fig. 8 are in agreement with the
domain monotonicity property (13), i-e., the curves of
/ (apo) are ordered according to the fact that a rhombus
is inscribed into an ellipse, which in turn is inscribed into
a rectangle (of the same aspect ratio a/b). In particular,
he numerical coefficients in front of In(b/a) are 0.52, 0.59
and 0.64 for these three shapes.

For all three shapes, we also observed the asymp-
otic behavior pu, x 1/(aln(b/a)) for some other eigen-
values (not shown). It is worth noting that a simi-
ar behavior of the principal eigenvalue was obtained
for the exterior Steklov problem for elongated prolate
spheroids with semiaxes a, a, b [80]. The explicit con-
struction of a matrix representation of the associated
Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator allowed one to show that
Hon « 1/(aln(b/a)) as a > O for the eigenvalues jU0,n
corresponding to axially symmetric eigenfunctions.

C. Spectral weights

Next, we look at the coefficient Fy that represents
the relative contribution of the principal eigenmode to
the reactive capacitance. For a circular patch, one has
Fo ® 0.97 [68], i.e., the principal eigenmode provides
the dominant contribution. A similar observation was
reported for the exterior Steklov problem for tori and
two balls [81]. We inspect how the patch anisotropy may
affect the coefficient Fo. Figure 9 shows Fo as a func-
tion of the aspect ratio a/b for three considered shapes.
The first observation is that Fo remains the dominant

contribution for all three shapes on the considered range
0.01 < a/b < 1. Curiously, the behavior is quite differ-
ent between rectangles and elliptic/rhombic patches: the
coefficient Fo is almost constant for rectangles, whereas
it exhibits a very slow decay for ellipses and rhombuses
as a decreases. A clarification of this distinction remains
an interesting open problem.

The empirical observation that Fo remains above 0.78
for the considered domains and aspect ratios raises sev-
eral geometric questions. Even though Fp decreases on
the range 0.01 < a/b < 1, it is yet unclear whether this
decay holds in the limit a + 0. Moreover, even if Fy > 0
as a — 0, such a slow decay requires to consider ex-
tremely thin patches to achieve small Fo. Is it possible
to construct other types of shapes to diminish Fp? While
the actual value of Fp does not look relevant, the close-
ness of Fy to 1 may have important consequences. For
instance, the upper and lower bounds (84, 85) are close
when Fp * 1, yielding thus an accurate estimate for the
rincipal eigenvalue jo. Moreover, we showed in Sec.
IID that the accuracy of the sigmoidal approximation
(27) is higher when Fo is close to 1. For these reasons,
urther analysis and eventual decrease of Fy may provide
a better understanding of the reactive capacitance.

For such an attempt, we consider a rectangular dumb-
ell patch formed by two squares that are connected by a
ong thin rectangular channel. When the channel width
goes to 0, the connection progressively disappears, and
he dumbbell patch reduces to two disconnected squares.
The asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and eigen-
functions of the Laplace operator in dumbbell domains
was thoroughly investigated in the past (see [103] and
references therein). In particular, Laplacian eigenfunc-
ions can be localized in one part of the dumbbell when
hey cannot “squeeze” through a thin channel, and this
ehavior strongly depends on the type of the boundary
condition (Dirichlet vs Neumann). In contrast, the con-
nectivity of a patch is expected to be much less rele-
vant for the exterior Steklov problem. In fact, even in
he disconnected setting, there are long-range interac-
ions between distinct parts of the patch via the kernel
(y.y’) =1/(2n|y — y').
Figure 10 illustrates the first 9 eigenfunctions U;,|p on
such a dumbbell patch. The first and most important
observation is that the weight Fy + 0.56 of the principal
eigenfunction is diminished as compared to that of ellip-
ic, rectangular and rhombic patches. In turn, the con-
tibution of the eigenfunctions Y; and V4 became more

D. Sigmoidal approximation

We inspect the quality of the explicit approximation
C*PP(y) from Eq. (27). For this purpose, we evaluate
the maximal relative error of C#PP(j:) as compared to
C(), over a broad range of yz from 10~? to 107. Since
the approximation (27) reproduces correctly the leading-
order asymptotic behavior of C'(js) in both limits pz + 0
and 4 > oo, this estimate is expected to actually cover
the whole range of 4 from 0 to oo. For the considered

with the maximal relative error of 4.4% corresponding to

tations and various bounds for the reactive capacitance.
Apart from these theoretical achievements, we obtained
several practical results with potential applications in
chemical physics that we summarize below.

The first practical resu!

t is that the principal eigen-

the quadratic patch.
According to Eq. (34), t

he relative error of the sig-
exceed Emax. In the case of

mode provides the dominant contribution to the reactive
capacitance. On one hand, an important role of the prin-
cipal eigenmode could be expected; indeed, as Vo is the
unique eigenfunction that does not change sign on the
patch, its projection onto a constant cannot vanish, ie.,
Fy > 0. In turn, the other eigenfunctions VY; are or-
thogonal to Wo and thus must change sign, so that their
projections onto a constant are expected to be smaller.
On the other hand, our numerical results indicate that
the contribution Fy exceeds 96% for all considered rect-
angular patches, irrespective of their aspect ratio (see
Fig. 9). For elliptic and rhombic patches, the situation
is different: the relative weight Fo is still dominant but
it decreases very slowly as the aspect ratio a/b goes to
0. However, even for the value a/b as small as 0.01, the
principal eigenmode provides 88% for the elliptic patch
and 78% for the rhombic patch. The dominant role of
Fo suggests that the associated principal eigenvalue de-
termines the most relevant lengthscale of the problem as
1/po. Rewriting Eq. (21) as

and neglecting the second sum, one gets a rough approx-
imation pig ® 27C(oo)/|P| (in practice, the right-hand
side is the Payne’s upper bound (83)). For instance, for
he circular patch of unit radius, this approximation gives
fio © 4/m & 1.27, whereas the actual numerical value is
.159, i.e., one gets only 10% relative error. More accu-
rate bounds that involve the constant Ap were discussed
in Sec. ITH. A systematic analysis of the accuracy of
hese approximations presents an interesting perspective.
Another related open question is to characterize the
atches, for which Fo is smaller than a given threshold.
According to our numerical results, one may probably
achieve this condition by taking extremely thin elliptic
or rhombic patches, but are there other ways to dimin-
ish Fy? We provided an example of a dumbbell domain,
for which the relatively low value Fo + 0.56 could result
from the localization phenomenon. However, a rigorous
analysis of this phenomenon via local estimates on the
eigenfunctions seems to be much more challenging than
in the conventional setting of Laplacian eigenfunctions
(see [103]). Moreover, one can inspect the contribution of
other eigenfunctions and ask whether there exist patches,
for which the relative contribution of the principal eigen-
function is not maximal? Even though these questions
sound rather abstract, a better understanding of the re-
ation between the shape of the patch and the geometry
of its Steklov eigenfunctions may help to design more
efficient catalysts with desired reactive properties.
The second practically important result is that the sim-
le sigmoidal approximation C#P? (j:) from Eq. (26) turns
out to be accurate for a variety of patch shapes that we
considered. This numerical observation suggests that, for
many practical purposes, it is sufficient to know the elec-
rostatic capacitance C(oo) and the surface area |I| of
he patch. The additive form of Eq. (26) allows one to
interpret C*PP() as a consecutive connection of a “dif-

16

fusion resistance” 1/C(oo) and a “reaction resistance”
2x/(pI\T|), in the language of electrostatics. In fact, as
a resistance is the ratio between the applied voltage and
ihe induced electric current, 1/C(j1) plays the role of a re-
sistance in diffusion-reaction problems. The above inter-
pretation was proposed as an empirical way to describe
che Laplacian transport, which is decomposed into the
first diffusive step and the second reactive step [96-99].
Its mathematical validation for electrochemical transport
was provided in [82], while our work justifies it for steady-
state diffusion-controlled reactions on partially reactive
flat patches. Moreover, we obtained an upper bound
(34) for the relative error of the sigmoidal approxima-
tion, which is expressed in terms of |I'|, Coco), and the
constant Ap defined in Eq. (20). We derived a useful
representation (B3) for an efficient numerical computa-
ion of Ap for general polygonal patches and provided
he exact explicit formulas for elliptic and rectangular
patches. The versatile roles of this constant in various
contexts were discussed in [81].
Following [81, 90], we introduce the reactive size Lp =
A|P|/(m?C(co)) of a flat patch of arbitrary shape. The
numerical prefactor 4/7? was included for convenience,
o ensure that the reactive size of a circular patch is its
diameter 2a. For instance, the reactive size of a quadratic
patch with edge length L is Lp + 1.11L, where we used
he numerical value C(oo) ~ 0.3667874 for the capaci-
ance of the unit square [104]. For an elliptic patch with
semiaxes a < b, one has

Fe EL (98)

T

For elongated elliptic patches with a < b, one gets Lp ©
4aln(4b/a), i.e., the reactive size vanishes as a — 0, as
expected.

While this paper was focused on flat patches, most re-
sults can be immediately generalized to bounded targets
of arbitrary shape with sufficiently smooth boundary in
R°. In turn, the large- behavior of C(j) that origi-
nated from the edge singularity, as well as the domain
monotonicity of the Steklov eigenvalues, are not valid in
general. The efficient numerical tool that we developed
here is also not applicable for general targets. In some
special cases, the symmetries of the target allow one to
employ orthogonal curvilinear coordinates to represent
Steklov eigenfunctions on the basis of special functions.
This technique was used for prolate and oblate spheroids
in [80], as well as for a pair of balls and a torus in [81].
For instance, the spectral expansion (14), the role of the
principal weight Fo, and the accuracy of the sigmoidal
approximation (27) were discussed for these targets in
[81]. However, the numerical computation of Steklov
eigenmodes for an arbitrarily-shaped target requires the
knowledge of the Green’s function G(y, y’) in the exte-
rior of the target, as well as a suitable boundary integral
method. A further development in this direction presents
an interesting perspective. More generally, the proposed
theoretical description of the reactive capacitance opens

Appendix A: Numerical approach

This Appendix describes the practical implementation
of our numerical approach for solving the spectral prob-
lems (3) and (23).

1. Finite-element method

We employ a finite-element method to solve the in-
tegral eigenvalue problems numerically. The patch I is
covered by a triangular _" composed of N;, triangles
denoted as Tj, j = 1,. We denote three vertices
of the j-th gangle as — = "(Ph Pi): with k = 1, 2,3,
and the total number of vertices is Ne. For convenience
of notations, we allow the index k to take values 4 and 5
by setting Pja = Pj; and Pj5 = Pjz. We also introduce
the unit tangent vector T;, and the unit normal vector
njx to the edge (Pjx, Pj(z41)) (see Fig. 11):

We employ linear basis functions to represent eigen-
functions on the mesh in order to achieve higher accuracy
as compared to piecewise-constant basis functions. For
the sake of clarify, we start with barycentric basis func-
tions {yjx}, i.e., Yjx(y) is a linear function on the j-th
triangle T; (and 0 otherwise) such that yj (Pj) = dk,n
for k,k’ € {1,2,3}. They form so-called discontinuous
Galerkin or “broken P1” space, to be distinguished from
nodal basis (or hat) functions that we will reconstruct at
the end. The barycentric basis functions can be written
explicitly as

pik (y) = 1—(y — Pix, vjx); (A3)
where (-,-) denotes the scalar product, and

patch to obtain a semi-analytical representation of the
matrix elements G'jx,;-y. In fact, we aim to evaluate ez-

The simplest quadrature employs the barycentric rule.
However, one of the major numerical difficulties for solv-
ing the spectral problem (11) is that the matrix G is not
sparse that significantly limits its size and thus requires
using relatively coarse meshing. In order to improve the
accuracy, it is therefore convenient to apply more ac-
curate quadratures when integrating over triangles. We
employ Dunavant 7-point quadrature rule [105]: for a
smooth enough function f(y), we set

[t ) dy = mi om f(M%aP. i + Yi2P. ia + VigPj3),

(A22)

where

wy = 0.225, 41 = 12 = 143 = 1/3,
w2 = 0.132394, vo, = 0.059716, v22 = 123 = 0.470142,
ws = 0.125939, 51 = 0.797427, vs52 = v53 = 0.101287,

whereas w3 = wa = w2 with v3; and 14; being obtained
by permutations from 2;, and wg = w7 = ws with v6;
and v7; being obtained by permutations from v;;. This
quadrature is known to be exact for polynomials up to
degree 5.

Once the matrix elements Gjx,;~7 are found, one can
solve numerically the generalized eigenvalue problem for
square matrices G and M, that allows one to approxi-
mate some Steklov eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. This
final step can be further improved by transforming the
above representation in terms of barycentric basis func-
tions {~~}, associated with triangles, into more con-
venient nodal basis (or hat) functions {¢;}, associated
to the nodes of the mesh. For each node P; (with i =
1,2,...,.Np), ¢:(a) is a linear function on the triangles
that contain P; (and 0 otherwise) such that ¢;(P;) = 1
and 0 at all other nodes. In fact, on the j-th triangle

containing the vertex P;, ¢; is simply the barycentric
function yj, with the index k such that Pj, = P;. As a
consequence, one can regroup the earlier defined matrix
elements Gjx,j7h and Mjx,;-~/ into new matrix elements

In this way, one has to solve numerically the generalized
eigenvalue problem for square matrices G and M:
GV =\MV. (A25)
Let us denote the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this
problem as A, and V;, and enumerate the eigenvalues to
form a decreasing sequence: Ayo > Ai > A2 > --:. One
sees that 1/\, is an approximation of the k-th eigen-
value j1%, whereas the components of the vector V; are
the coefficients of an approximate expansion of the k-th
eigenfunction Y;, on the nodal basis functions:

Moreover, the value of W;, on a node P; is simply [V,]j.

from which the weights follow as Fj, = dz/|I'|. We out-
line that the representation in terms of nodal basis func-
tions has two practical advantages: (i) the matrices G
and M of size N, x Np are much smaller than G and
M (of size 3N;, x 3N;) that allows for their faster nu-
merical diagonalization; and (ii) the continuous nature
of nodal basis functions yields a smoother representation
of eigenfunctions. We employ this method throughout
the manuscript.

2. Solving the alternative Steklov problem

An equivalent reformulation of the spectral problem
(23) was discussed in [66, 83]. To ensure that all eigen-
functions wy with k = 1,2,... are orthogonal to the
constant function &2’ = 1/,/|T], the kernel G(y, y’) can
be replaced by

wr(y) +wr(y’) + Ap

GN x , n
(yy’') iW

Gy, y') (A29)

where wr(y) and Ap were defined in Eqs. (19, 20). In
this way, the integral of GY (y, y’) over y € TI’ vanishes
so that a constant function is an eigenfunction of the
associated integral operator. It was shown in [66] that
the eigenfunctions UY satisfy for k = 1,2,...:

[Suv wo ay' = itu) (yer).
k
r
(A30)

In other words, one can search for the eigenpairs
{uy Vi} (with k > 1) of the spectral problem (23) by
solving the eigenvalue problem (A30). The missing eigen-
pair i’ = 0 and oY = 1/VITl can be added manually.

The numerical technique from Sec. A 1 is applicable for
solving the Steklov problem (23), which is equivalently
described by the kernel G% (y,y’) from Eq. (A29). In
fact, we need to find

Eq. (A23). As previously, one searches for eigenpairs
{A VX} solving the generalized eigenvalue problem
G*vy = AYMVY, enumerated by k = 1,2,... (here
the index starts from 1, given that pj’ = 0).
Once the eigenfunction UV (y) is constructed on the
patch, it can be easily extended into the upper half-space
R3. For this purpose, one can multiply Eq. (23) by the
Green’s function G(y, y’), multiply Eq. (6a) by UN (y’),
subtract them, integrate over y’ € Ri, use the Green’s
formula with boundary conditions and behavior at infin-
ity to get

WN (y) = VE (00) + ut [ Cluy WR ')ay, (834)
T

where G(y,y’) is given by the explicit formula (7). In
turn, the value at infinity, UN (oo), can be determined
by expressing G(y,y’) from Eq. (A29) and using Eq.
(A830):

3. Validation

To check the accuracy of our numerical method, we
compute the Steklov eigenvalues for the circular patch
of unit radius. This geometric setting can be consid-
ered as the limit c — 0 of an oblate spheroid with semi-
axes 1,1,c, for which an efficient numerical method for
solving Steklov problems was developed in [80]. This
method employs the oblate spheroidal coordinates to
achieve an accurate matrix representation of the asso-
ciated Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator. Its numerical di-
agonalization yields very accurate eigenvalues, which will
be referred to as “exact”.

Table I reports the first ten eigenvalues for both ver-
sions of the Steklov problem (see also Fig. 2 for eigen-
functions ©;,). Two different meshes were used to illus-
trate the role of the mesh size on the accuracy. The rel-
ative error of the presented eigenvalues does not exceed
0.1% even for the coarser mesh.

The rotational symmetry of the patch implies that an
eigenfunction on T can be represented in polar coordi-
nates (r,@) as e’""?Umn(r), with integer indices m and
n. Moreover, the structure of radial functions Umn(7)
is inherited from spherical harmonics Yj,» (see [80] for
more details); in particular, one can set n = 0,1,2,-:-
and m = —n,—n+1,--- ,n, as shown in the bottom row
of Table I. Note that the eigenvalues with (+m)n coin-
cide. As discussed in [80], the eigenfunctions satisfying
Neumann boundary condition (3c) correspond to even

m+n. Finally, as the difference G(a, y) — GN (x,y) is

Note also that our approach

does not recover the eigenvalue pi’ = 0 that corresponds

Appendix B: Computation of the constant Ar

The function wp (a) from Eq. (19) and the constant Ap
from Eq. (20) play an important role in the reformulation
of the spectral problem (23); see also [66] for various
applications of these quantities. For a circular patch,
their exact forms were obtained in [66]:

(BL)
where E(z) is the complete elliptic integral of the second
kind. In this Appendix, we discuss an alternative com-
putation of these quantities for other domains, beyond
the basic FEM representation (A32).

1. General patch

For any triangular patch, the function wr(a) is simply
proportional to the function F(a) defined by Eq. (A12),
for which the representation (A16) provides the exact
solution. Moreover, the exact representation (A16) can
be generalized to any polygon. As a consequence, this
representation allows one to compute exactly the function
wr(a) from Eq. (19) for any polygonal patch, without
resorting to triangulations:

¥ (ny, (Pe — 2)

wp(@) (B2)

where P;, are the vertices of the polygon, nx is the unit
normal vector to the k-th edge between vertices P, and
Pri (ng is oriented outward the polygon), I, is given
by Eq. (A17), and the sum is over all edges. In turn, the
constant Ap can be written as follows

1
Ar = sere | tela Ve) [le ule
ar r
1
= sare | tela Ve) | (me Vale — y|?/9)dlx,

where we used that A,.|a — y|?/9 = | — y|. As a conse-
quence, we obtain

Are sare | Bolre Ve) [ir Vele — y|(@ — y))dle
or or
1
=- sae | (menial
orxor
(Mews =e - Del (B3)

This formula opens a purely geometric way to access Ar,
allowing one to skip the computation of wr(a) and its
integration. We recall that the constant Ap determines
via Eq. (20) the coefficient cz of the Taylor expansion
(17) of the reactive capacitance.

and n(y) = y?(—1 + 2In(2/y))/4 + Oly?) as y > 0, to
obtain

In fact, as the rectangular patch shrinks to an interval,
which is inaccessible to reflected Brownian motion, the
constant Ap diverges logarithmically.

3. Elliptic patch

For an elliptic patch with semi-axes a and b, we em-
ploy the parameterization a1(t1) = (acost,,bsint,)' so

that c(t) = lah (t)| = Va? sin? t; +b? cos? t; and

Nz, = (bcosty,asint;)'/c(t1) and similar for a(tz). As
a consequence, Eq. (B3) reads

D(ti, t2)

x D(ti, te) —

where 7 = a/b and

D(ti,t2) = /7?(cos ty — costg)? + (sint, — sin tz)? .

To proceed, one can split the integration domain
(0, 27) x (0,27) into four twice smaller squares and use
the symmetry of sine and cosine functions to reduce the
integration domain to (0,7) x (0,7). By introducing the
new integration variables ty = (t; +t2)/2, these integrals
can be reduced to the complete elliptic functions. Skip-
ping these tedious lengthy computations, we just provide
the final result, which takes a particularly simple form:

K(V/1- @/8),

16
 373b

Ar (B10)
where K(z) is defined by Eq. (75). In the particular case
of a circular patch (a = b), we use K(0) = 7/2 to retrieve
the result (B1). In turn, in the limit a > 0, we use the
asymptotic relation (91) to get

Ar © 8 in(4b/a)

b).
373d (a<d)

(B11)

Substituting Eq. (B10) into our upper bound (86), we
get for any 0<a<b:

30?

16aK (x/1 — a2/b?) | (B12)

Ho S

It is instructive to compare this inequality with the

Payne’s upper bound (83). Substituting Eq. (90) for
the electrostatic capacitance, one has
2
Ho < (B13)

~ aK (\/1 — a/b?)

Remarkably, both bounds have the same functional form
and differ only by the numerical prefactors: 317/16 =
1.85 in Eq. (B12) and 2 in Eq. (B13). One sees that our
upper bound is slightly more accurate for any 0 < a < b.

4. Circular annulus

Finally, we consider a circular annulus of radii Ry <
Ry. As the boundary of the annulus is split into two
circles, the integral in Eq. (B3) has four contributions
when a and a run over the inner/outer circles:

Ar = Alf + Ag? + Ai? + AP,
where superscripts indicate inner and outer circles. Ac-
cording to Eq. (B1), we get

Ri + R3

Te (B14)

F 8

Ap + Ap’ = 5

with || = 1(R3
contributions.

For the outer circle, we employ the parameterization
Ne, = (costi,sinti)', ai(t1) = Rone,, diz, = Redt,

— R?). We now compute the remaining

and similar for a2. For the inner circle, we have ng, =
—(costi,sinti)', vi(t1) = —Rine,, dle, = Ridti, and
similar for a. We get then

where y = 2R) Ro/(R? + R3) < 1. The last integral can
be expressed in terms of the complete elliptic integrals as

io 4B Ro/R3 + BB ;
Ap = Sri (a =) K(/27/1 +7)

= (1+) B(V270¥9))).

By symmetry, one also gets A?’ = A‘? that completes
the computation of Ap.

For a thin annulus, one can set Ry = R and Ro =
R-+a. Using the asymptotic behavior of the complete
elliptic integrals K(z) and E(z) as z + 1, we get after
simplifications the small-a behavior of Ap:

(B15)

Ap 2 BER) + 3/2 (B16)

Comparing this expression with Eq. (B8) for a thin
rectangle, we conjecture the following leading-order de-
pendence for any thin patch, which can be seen as a
“thickening” of a planar curve C by “width” 2a (ie.,

T= {xe OR’ : |x—C| <a}):
Ap = EEE) + of (a0), (B17)

where |OI| is the perimeter of the patch. Combining this
relation with the bounds (86) and assuming that Fo is
close to 1, we get another conjecture that

independently of the actual shape and length of the thin
patch, which affect the constant (subleading) term.
