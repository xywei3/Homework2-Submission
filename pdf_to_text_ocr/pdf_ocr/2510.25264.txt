1. Introduction

Generally, the phase contrast generated by the real part of the refractive index in a hard-X-ray region is significantly
higher than the absorption contrast generated by its imaginary part [1]. In the X-ray region, numerous phase-contrast
methods have been developed and applied to microscopy, such as Zernike phase-contrast microscopy [2, 3], the
Bonse-Hart crystal optics interferometer [4], the propagation-based phase-contrast method (defocusing contrast in
full-field imaging microscopy) [5, 6], and the grating interferometer method (Talbot interferometer) [7]. Additionally,
the possibility of phase map reconstruction from propagation-based phase-contrast images has been demonstrated
[8, 9]. Several types of holographic imaging that are essentially phase-sensitive imaging have also been developed in
the soft- and hard-X-ray regions, including inline holography [10, 11], Fourier transform holography with Fresnel zone
plate optics [12, 13], two-beam interferometers with refractive prisms [14, 15], and total reflection mirrors [16, 17].

The propagation-based method (refraction-enhanced contrast) is the most widely used technique for phase-contrast
imaging in the hard-X-ray region. An advantage of the refraction-enhanced approach is that no additional optical
devices are required, and neither high spatial coherency nor high temporal coherency are necessary.

In the visible-light region, the simple and conventional schlieren imaging method [18] is widely used to visualize
transparent objects with a non-uniform optical thickness. The optical system of the traditional schlieren method is
schematically shown in Fig. 1. When an object is illuminated by a parallel beam, the beam penetrates the object directly
and creates a single spot on the back focal plane of an objective lens. The diffracted waves generate several spots around
the focal point, and their distance from the central spot is proportional to the spatial frequency of the corresponding
structure of the object. The plane of focus is referred to as the Fourier plane. The schlieren contrast is generated by
excluding one side of the diffracted waves by placing a single-blade beam stop (knife-edge filter) at the back focal
plane of the objective lens. Generally, the contrast of an image appears as an edge-enhanced bright-dark structure
known as the schlieren texture. Therefore, the schlieren method is not quantitative, but an easy and robust technique

as the phase-contrast image can be obtained by simply placing a knife-edge filter at the back focal plane. Furthermore,
the spatial resolution of the schlieren image is essentially the same as that of a conventional absorption-contrast image.

Recently, Watanabe and Aoki [19] reported a differential phase-contrast method based on the linear motion of
the knife-edge filter placed at the back focal plane (the Foucault knife-edge scanning filter method). A phase map
was obtained from the line integral of the measured differential phase images. However, capturing an image during
continuous motion or a series of images during step motion of the knife-edge filter poses several challenges. For
example, its application to tomography is difficult owing to the long measurement time taken for tomography scans
due to complicated scanning procedures. In this paper, we propose a new phase-retrieval method from a single schlieren
microscopy image in the hard-X-ray region. The proposed imaging method is simple and fast because the phase map can
be reconstructed from a single image captured without additional scanning. Therefore, the proposed method is expected
to find applications in high-speed live imaging and tomography. Although our method is suitable only for transparent
(negligible absorption) and weak-phase objects, the conditions can be generally satisfied for light element specimens
with thin thicknesses in the hard-X-ray region. Additionally, feasibility studies were conducted with a Fresnel zone
plate (FZP) as the objective lens in the hard-X-ray region (X-ray energy of 10 keV) at the AR-NE1A beamline of the
Photon Factory at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK).

2. Schlieren imaging and phase retrieval theory

2.1. Basic schlieren imaging theory
To consider the simple case of a phase-contrast object, a transparent object with a weak phase contrast is assumed.
The transmission function is expressed as in Eq. 1:

E = exp’? qd)

where x denotes a position of the phase-contrast direction on the input field and (x) denotes a real function that
expresses the phase-shift map. The input field is assumed to be unity and the magnitude of ¢ is assumed to be sufficiently
small compared to unity. Then, ignoring the higher-order terms, the transmission function can be written as follows:

Exl+id(x) (2)

The Fourier transform of the phase-shift map @(x) is defined as follows:

O(k) = / ° id(x) exp777!** dx GB)

co

R. Nishimura, et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 2 of 10
Novel phase-retrieval algorithm from a single-shot image for X-ray schlieren microscopy
where k denotes the wavenumber of the reciprocal space. Therefore, the transmission function can be described using
an inverse Fourier transform, as follows:

Oo)

Ex1+id(x)= i+ / @(k) exp?! dk (4)

00

The phase shift @ is defined as a purely real value. Therefore, the imaginary part of @ must be zero, such that
P(x) — $*(x) = 0 (5)

Here, ¢* denotes the complex conjugate of @. Using the inverse Fourier transform of ®(k), Eq. 6 and Eq. 7 can be
derived.

1 f* i i i

T Joo et
ee " 28 .
o / @(k) exp?! dk + / ®*(—k) exp?” dk =0 (7)
68 =

Taking the Fourier transform of Eq. 7, we have the following:

© oo oo ©
/ exp77"** dx / (Kk) exp™"** dk + / exp? dx / ©*(—k) exp" dk = 0 (8)
2 = ~ -

co = 00

Here, ®(k) must satisfy the following condition [18]:
@(k) + ®*(-k) =0 (9)
The schlieren contrast can be generated by excluding one side of the diffracted waves [18], as follows:

co
E=1+ [ O(k) exp?*"™ dk (10)
0

The intensity observed at the detector can be expressed by the square of the absolute value of the field E as in Eq. 11.

I = |E>P=ExE*
| * | *

By ignoring the higher-order terms, the image intensity J can be approximated as follows:

0 0

= 1+ [/ @(k) exp?"** an| + [/ *(k) exp 77 at] (12)
0 0

Subsequently, using Eq. 9, we obtain Eq. 13.

Finally, the contrast function of the schlieren image, AJ(x), can be written as

ars) =1a)-1 [ sign(k)®(k) exp?" dk (14)

00

where sign(k) is defined as follows:

Hence, schlieren-contrast intensity modulation can be considered as a type of filtered image of the phase-shift map
with a frequency filter of +1 for k > 0 and —1 for k < 0. This frequency filter is similar to the filter used in the Fourier
representation of the Hilbert transform [20]. The spatial resolution limit of the reconstructed phase image is essentially
the same as that of the schlieren- and absorption-contrast images.

2.2. Phase retrieval from a schlieren image
By taking the Fourier transform of Eq. 14 on both the sides, we obtain Eq. 16, as follows:

© © co
‘ AI(x) exp?! dx = / exp 27 dx f sign(k)®(k) exp?" = sign(k)®(k) (16)

co =o co
such that we obtain Eq. 17.
* 2
®(k) = sign(k) / AI (x) exp?" dx (17)
—0o

Using the definition of ®(k), Eq. 17 can be rewritten as

O(k) = / ° ip(x) exp?" dx = sign(k) / ° AI (x) exp?" dx (18)

00

Taking the inverse Fourier transform of Eq. 18, the phase function ig(x) can be written as follows:

0. Ps C0. 4

68 =

0

ip(x)

©o ©
/ exp?”!** dk sign(k) / AI(x) exp?! dx (19)
09 =o
Therefore, the phase-shift map can be obtained by the Fourier transform of the intensity modulation, followed by the
inverse Fourier transform with a simple filter function of +1 for k > 0 and —1 for k < 0.

2.3. Expansion to the partial coherent condition

The theory of schlieren imaging and phase retrieval under parallel-beam illumination conditions are discussed in
this section. Usually, the actual illumination is partially coherent. The expansion of phase retrieval to the partially
coherent illumination condition has been demonstrated. To consider a partially coherent state, an illuminating beam
consisting of an ensemble of independent beams that each have a different inclination with respect to the optical axis is
considered. Thereafter, the signal intensity is obtained by the summation of the intensities of each plane-wave beam.
When the incident wave is parallel and the inclination angle to the optical axis is 6, the schlieren contrast can be
described as follows:

oo ; —ko ;
I(x)=14+ / @(k) exp?!** a + [/ =—(k) exp?" dk (20)
ko oo
Here, kg is defined as follows:
sin 0

where J is the X-ray wavelength and //sin 6 represents the period of the object structure. Therefore, an object structure
with a spatial frequency lesser than kp does not yield contrast in the schlieren image. Conversely, if the object does
not have a structure with a spatial frequency lesser than kg, the schlieren contrast is essentially the same as that in the
normal incidence condition.

When a part of the illuminating beam arrives at the object/objective, the angular distribution of the incident beam
is assumed to be g(ko), as shown in Fig. 2, and the beam stop is placed at @ = 0. The intensity modulation can be
described as follows:

©0
Al(x) = I(x)-1& / G(k)®(k) exp?" dk (22)

where G(k) is defined by the integral of g(k), as in Eqs. 23 and 24.

Thereafter, G(k) is assumed to be normalized as in Eq. 25.
©
G(co) = [ g(k)dk =1 (25)

Then, the phase map can be reconstructed using the integral of the angular distribution function G(k), as follows:

‘2 i 00. i

Hence, if the angular distribution function is exactly known, the phase map can be retrieved from the measured single
image using the schlieren method.
Apparently, when g(k) is a delta function, the intensity modulation can be simply written as

AI(x) ~ / sign(k)®(k) exp?™™™ dk (27)

00

Eq. 27 represents a coherent illumination. Conversely, for a sufficiently low-coherent illumination, where the angular

distribution of the illuminating beam is uniform such that g(k) is constant for k < k,,,,, where k,,,, is the maximum
value of k, the integral G(k) can be written as in Eq. 28.
Gk) =~ (28)

Then, the schlieren contrast can be expressed as follows:

Therefore, for a low-coherent illumination condition, the schlieren contrast is proportional to the differential of the
wavefront. Additionally, an exact phase retrieval is apparently possible using a simple integral of the measured schlieren
image.

2.4. Correction for a finite imaging plane

In the proposed phase-retrieval theory, the field of the imaging plane is assumed to be infinite. However, in an
actual experimental setup, the imaging plane is limited by optics and detectors. In this situation, in the phase retrieval
process, the edge region of the limited imaging plane behaves as a large dummy contrast which has the amplitude from
zero to some finite value (usually non-phase shift background value). Then, without correction, it appears as a striped
pattern or an undulating pattern artifact in the phase-retrieved image. Thus, a padding region filled with a constant value
equivalent to a non-phase shift is added to each edge of the input image (intensity-normalized). This padding region
is to ensure that the dummy contrast does not affect the sample image that phase-retrieved from the original imaging
plane in the phase-retrieved image after phase recovery. The array size of the total image, including the padding region,
should be at least eight times larger than the size of the phase-retrieval direction of the input image.

3. Experimental setup

The experimental setup of the X-ray microscope was installed at the AR-NEIA beamline of the Photon Factory
facility at KEK. The installed experimental setup (Fig. 3) was essentially the same as that used for our previous
experiment [21], and is briefly explained next.

The X-ray beam from a multi-pole wiggler is monochromatized by passing through the Si 111 double-crystal
monochromator, and collimated by the variable-bent double multi-layer mirror optics configured in a crossed-mirror
geometry (Kirkpatrick-Baez optics) to achieve a nearly parallel beam illumination. Then, the X-ray beam is collimated
by the aperture and illuminates the sample. Only the lower half of the FZP is irradiated for diffraction-order-sorting
in the parallel beam illumination. The X-ray beam that passes through the sample is magnified by the FZP, and partly
cut-off by the knife edge placed at the back-focal-plane of the objective FZP to obtain the schlieren phase contrast.
Finally, the X-ray beam passes through the vacuum pipe (approximately 5-m long) and is imaged by the X-ray camera.
The distance between the object and X-ray camera is set to approximately 6.9 m. A complementary metal-oxide-
semiconductor camera (C12849-111U, Hamamatsu Photonics) with a pixel format of 2048 x 2048, a pixel size of
6.5 um, a 10-um-thick gadolinium oxysulfide (P43) scintillator, and 1:1 fiber optics, was used as the X-ray camera.
In the experiment, a single FZP optics was employed. The FZP used in the current experiment was fabricated by
Applied Nanotools (Canada), and has a diameter of 550 um and outermost zone width of 50 nm. The zone material
used was 0.5-um-thick gold. In the experiment, a 10-keV monochromatic X-ray beam was used. Therefore, the focal
length of the FZP is calculated to be 222 mm, and the magnification is calculated to be X29. The actual magnification
was calibrated by measuring the calibration standard (CAL21HEI2, Applied Nanotools), and the magnification of the
X-ray optics is measured to be X28.5, which is consistent with the calculated value. The demonstration sample used
in the proof-of-principle experiment, siemens-star and line-and-space patterns, was also calibration standard made of
600-nm-thick gold.

4. Results and Discussion

Figs. 4-6 present the experimental results of the demonstration. The total exposure time of each images was 50
s (5s x 10 images) for a 15-mA stored current. Fig. 4 (a) shows the absorption image (intensity-normalized) of the
siemens-star and line-and-space patterns following the calibration standard, while Fig. 4 (b) presents the intensity
profile at line A-B in Fig. 4 (a). The absorption image clearly showed that the calibration standard could be regarded
as a practical pure-phase object for the given condition. Fig. 5 (a) shows the schlieren phase-contrast image (intensity-
normalized) of the calibration standard, which was obtained by adding a simple knife-edge filter to the back focal plane;
the contrast direction was vertical to the figures. Fig. 5 (b) presents the intensity profile at line A-B in Fig. 5 (a). Fig. 6

(a) illustrates the phase-retrieval image processed from Fig. 5 (a) using our proposed phase-retrieval algorithm, while
Fig. 6 (b) presents the phase-shift profile at line A-B in Fig. 6 (a). The phase-shift map due to the sample structures
was confirmed to be reconstructed, as shown in Fig. 6, while Fig. 5 shows the typical schlieren texture with the bright
and dark pair contrast at the edge of the object structure.

The reconstructed phase-retrieval image had a reasonable profile; a positive phase shift occurred in the thin metal
region, while other regions showed a negative or no value. Some negative-value regions were possibly caused by optic
incoherence. The phase shift was approximately 0.3 rad (from the negative-value region to the thin-metal region).
Contrarily, the estimated phase shift was 0.909 rad (calculated from the thickness and material of the metal region:
600 nm of gold). The discrepancy could be partially attributable to the structures of the test samples. Although the
absorption was negligible, as shown in Fig. 4, the weak phase-contrast condition was not fully satisfied. A phase shift
lower than the calculated value, with a known optical constant, could also have been caused by insufficient coherence of
the illuminating beam or stray light of the image-forming optics or both. Further exact phase retrieval was possible by
adjusting the filter function and improving the optics. However, these measurements confirmed that our phase-retrieval
method was effective and applicable to phase imaging in hard-X-ray full-field microscopy.

5. Conclusions

In this paper, we propose a new phase-retrieval algorithm for a weak-phase object from a single-shot X-ray schlieren
image. A proof-of-principle experiment was performed in the hard-X-ray region at the AR-NE1A beamline of the
Photon Factory facility at KEK. The conventional schlieren method was found to be applicable for phase-contrast
imaging in the hard-X-ray region, and the phase map was retrieved from the measured single-shot schlieren image using
the proposed phase-retrieval algorithm. The schlieren method was applicable to optical systems with FZP objectives
and optical devices such as compound refractive lenses. The single-shot phase-contrast image required by the proposed
algorithm could be obtained by including a simple knife-edge filter to the back focal plane without step or continuous
motion of the filter. Therefore, the proposed phase-retrieval algorithm is expected to find use in high-resolution phase-
contrast imaging and phase-contrast microtomography.
