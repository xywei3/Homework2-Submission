ABSTRACT

Recent observations suggest that planetary engulfment by a giant star may produce
radiation that resembles subluminous red novae. We present three-dimensional hydro-
dynamical simulations of the interaction between an eccentric 5M; giant planet and its
1 Mz red-giant host star. The planet’s pericenter is initially 60% of the stellar radius
and is fully engulfed after tens of orbits. Once inside the stellar envelope, the planet
generates pressure disturbances that steepen into shocks, ejecting material from the
envelope. We use post-processing to calculate the light curves produced by planetary
engulfment. We find that the hot stellar ejecta enhances the stellar luminosity by sev-
eral orders of magnitude. A prolonged hydrogen recombination plateau appears when
the ejecta cools to about 104K. The late-time rapid dimming of the light curve follows
dust formation, which obscures the radiation. For planets with lower eccentricity, the
orbital decay proceeds more slowly, although the observable properties remain similar.

Keywords: hydrodynamics — methods: numerical — planet-star interactions

1. INTRODUCTION

Planets orbiting stars outside our Solar System have been observed over the past few decades, with
nearly 6,000 confirmed discoveries! to date. As the host star evolves and its envelope expands, the
planets may be “absorbed” by the stars, a phenomenon known as planetary engulfment (Villaver &
Livio 2009; Schlaufman & Winn 2013; Lau et al. 2025b).

Planetary engulfment can produce a variety of observable signatures. The transfer of orbital angular
momentum from the engulfed planet to the stellar envelope may change the star’s rotation (Peterson
et al. 1983; Qureshi et al. 2018; Stephan et al. 2020). The deposition of lithium (7Li) in the stellar
envelope can also increase its observed abundance (Sandquist et al. 1998; Soares-Furtado et al. 2021).

Additionally, the radiation emitted from ejecta gas during engulfment can boost the star’s luminosity,
leading to either transient or secular brightness enhancements (Metzger et al. 2012, 2017; MacLeod
et al. 2018a). A recent observation of an infrared transient, ZTF SLRN-2020, provided evidence for
planetary engulfment (De et al. 2023).

During the evolution of a planetary system, a planet’s orbit can be excited to high eccentricity
through planet—planet scatterings (e.g., see Rasio & Ford (1996); Weidenschilling & Marzari (1996);
Lin & Ida (1997); Ford et al. (2001); Chatterjee et al. (2008); Juri¢é & Tremaine (2008); Petrovich
et al. (2014); Anderson et al. (2020); Li et al. (2021), and references therein) or through perturbations
from external stellar or planetary companions via the Lidov-Kozai mechanism (Wu & Murray 2003;
Fabrycky & Tremaine 2007; Anderson et al. 2016). Highly eccentric planets may experience periodic
tidal dissipation (Vick et al. 2019) and excite stellar mass losses during pericenter passages (Sahai
et al. 2016; Salas et al. 2019). If the eccentricity continues to grow, a planet can directly enter the
stellar envelope before tidal forces circularize its orbit, resulting in engulfment.

A few hydrodynamic simulations of planetary engulfment have been conducted, but none have
considered the case of eccentric orbital planets. Sandquist et al. (1998, 2002) used a nested grid to
simulate a planet spiraling into the stellar envelope on circular orbit. They found that the dissolution
of the planet enhances the surface metallicity. Wind-tunnel simulations (MacLeod & Ramirez-Ruiz
2015; MacLeod et al. 2017; Yarza et al. 2023) focused on the local flow surrounding the planet to
model the gravitational and hydrodynamic drag forces. Global simulations (Staff et al. 2016; Lau
et al. 2022a) followed the evolution of the planet’s orbit and determined the mass distribution around
the planet, as well as the response of the stellar envelope. However, these works did not calculate
the luminosity associated with the engulfment, and were limited by the artificial heating of the
photosphere in SPH codes (Staff et al. 2016) or the lack of resolution of the stellar surface in the
simulations (Lau et al. 2022a).

In this study, we conduct 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the engulfment of eccentricity (e =
0.45, 0.65) giant planets with a mass of 5M; by a 1 Mo evolved red giant star. Note that while
close encounters between eccentric giant planets and main-sequence stars can certainly happen, such
encounters lead to tidal disruption of the planet near the stellar surface. For giant stars, deep planet
engulfment is possible. We adopt the Athena++ code (Stone et al. 2020) for our hydrodynamical
simulations and use the outputs to compute the light curve in post-processing.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe our numerical setup, the
method for calculating the light curve and mass loss, and an analytical model for the planetary
trajectory. Section 3 presents our fiducial 3D simulation results (with the planet eccentricity e =
0.65), including the hydrodynamic response of the stellar envelope (Section 3.1), planetary orbital
migration (Section 3.2), light curve and photospheric temperature and radius (Section 3.3), and mass
loss of the ejected gas (Section 3.4). Section 4 examines the case of a planet with a lower eccentricity
(e = 0.45), holding other parameters fixed. In Section 5, we summarize our main conclusions, and
discuss the implications and uncertainties.

2. NUMERICAL METHOD, SETUP AND ANALYTICAL MODEL

To investigate the response of the stellar envelope following planetary engulfment, we perform
hydrodynamic simulations using the Athena++ code (Stone et al. 2020). Section 2.1 details the
simulation setup for modeling the stellar envelope and the planet. Sections 2.2 and 2.3 describe our
ECCENTRIC ORBITAL PLANETARY ENGULFMENT 3

methods for calculating the light curve and mass loss. In Section 2.4, we present the analytical model
for the planetary trajectory.

2.1. Numerical setup

Our numerical treatment of binary interactions is similar to that described in MacLeod ct al. (2018b,
2019); MacLeod & Loeb (2020a,b, 2023). We model the dynamical response of the star under the
gravitational influence of the planet by solving the Eulerian hydrodynamic equations in spherical
coordinates, excising the stellar core. The planet is represented as a gravitational source using a
spline function with a softening length of R, = 0.05 R,, where R, is the stellar radius. We adopt an
ideal gas equation of state (EoS) with an adiabatic index y = 5/3, so that the pressure is related to
the internal energy density wu via P = 2u/3.

To obtain a realistic stellar profile, we use the 1D stellar evolution code MESA (Paxton et al. 2011,
2013, 2015, 2018, 2019) to evolve a star of initial mass M, = 1 Mo to the red-giant phase, reaching a
radius of R, = 100 Rs. Our model has a luminosity of 1.22 x 10° Lo and an effective temperature of
3406 K. After obtaining the 1D profile, we map the density and pressure to the 3D Athena+-+ grid,
and excise the core within a radius of R, = 0.3 R,. We use P = 2u/3 to compute the internal energy
density from the pressure in each cell. The mapped 3D profile must satisfy hydrostatic equilibrium;

if not, we relax the stellar envelope so that it reaches equilibrium. This step is particularly important
for early red giant stars. For our MESA giant star model, no envelope adjustment (Zingale et al.
2002) is required, resulting in a similar initial stellar luminosity in Athena++, as shown in Section 3.3.
For numerical reason, we embed a low-density, constant sound speed (c, = constant) gas (satisfying
P = pc2/y) outside the star and allow the system to relax for approximately 6tayn to establish a
stable stellar profile, where tay is the star’s dynamical time

R3
tags = Gn = 18.6 days. (1)

The sound speed c, is chosen to be much larger than the actual photosphere value. Tests conducted
with various ambient gas profiles indicate that they have no significant impact on our results.

For our fiducial simulation, we set the planet mass to M, = 5M, and initially place it at the
apocenter of an eccentric orbit with eccentricity e = 0.65 and semi-major axis a = 1.35 R,. After the
star is fully relaxed, the planet is released, and the star-planet system is evolved dynamically. Upon
engulfment, the planet is expected to eventually dissolve deep within the stellar interior, at a radius
smaller than our simulation inner boundary. Therefore, once the planet reaches the inner boundary,
we artificially set its mass to zero. The simulation then continues to capture the response of the
stellar envelope following the planet’s disruption. The total simulation duration exceeds 300 tayn.

Our computational domain employs a spherical-polar mesh with resolution (N,,Ne, Ne) =
(192,96, 192). The radial domain extends from R, = 0.3 R, to 100 R, with logarithmically spaced
zones. The angular domain covers the full 47 steradians, spanning 0 to 7 in polar angle and 0 to 27
in azimuthal angle.

2.2. Light curve calculation

Planetary engulfment produces the shocked ejecta gas. To compute the luminosity, we first find
the position of the photosphere, where the optical depth

/ atone =I, (2)

Tpho

with « the gas opacity and rpno the photosphere radius. Since Athena++ does not allow vacuum, we
put an artificial ambient gas outside the star, as described in Section 2.1. To account for the nonzero
optical depth of the ambient gas, we employ a passive scalar r, (specifying the concentration of the
stellar component in each cell) associated with the stellar material. The optical depth integration
only includes gas with a stellar mass fraction exceeding a specified threshold (r, > 0.9); tests with
other thresholds, such as 0.6, demonstrate negligible differences in the results.

We use two opacity models: analytical formula and lookup tables from MESA. Each model assumes
the hydrogen mass fraction X = 0.7 and solar metallicity Z = 0.02. The analytic opacity expression
ECCENTRIC ORBITAL PLANETARY ENGULFMENT 5
« is from Pejcha et al. (2017):
aay=l
K = Kim + [Ky- + (Ke + KK) ] ; (3)

where Km = 0.1Z is the molecular opacity, Ky- = 1.1 x 1077°Z°°p°5T"” is the H~ opacity, Ke =
0.2(1+-X) is the electron scattering opacity, and kK = 4x 1079(1+X)ZpT-3> is the Kramers opacity,
all in cgs units.

The lookup opacity table is obtained by combining the opacity tables with the file names
9s98_20.02_x0.7.data and lowT_fa05_gs98_20.02_20.7.data (Grevesse & Sauval 1998) from MESA. To
get the opacity, we use a similar strategy as MESA by linearly interpolating in the log space of
density and temperature. Table gs98_z0.02_20.7.data is used for high temperature, logT > 3.88,
lowT_fa05_gs98_z0.02_20.7.data for low temperature, log T < 3.8, and “blending” them in the region
3.8 — 3.88. To avoid discontinuities, quintic smoothing is used for blending. Examples of the two
opacities as a function of temperature for several chosen densities of interest are shown in Figure 1.

The two opacity models give similar results with two main differences. First, the MESA opacity
model shows significant dust formation below 3000K, while the analytical formula gives the same
low molecular opacity of low temperature (T ~ 3000 K) for all densities. Second, the MESA opacity
model shows a decline at T ~ (6 — 8) x 10° K for low densities (the light blue and dark blue lines in
Figure 1), which indicates the onset of the recombination of hydrogen; the analytical formula shows
recombination starts around 104K.

Once we find the radius of photosphere, we use the local gas temperature to calculate the specific
radiation intensity I, = B,(T’), where B,(T) is the Planck function. Since the Athena++ simulation
outputs include only the internal energy density and pressure, we apply the ideal gas EoS in post-
processing to get temperature

P = pkpT/(ump), (4)
where ps ~ 0.625 is the mean molecular weight of solar abundance and m, is proton mass (not to be
confused with planet’s mass M,).

The specific “radial” luminosity Lyaq,, is then obtained by integrating the radiation flux along the
radial direction over all solid angles around the source,

where Tyno is the photospheric temperature. The total “radial” luminosity Lraq = f dvLraa, v is

where ggp is the Boltzmann-Stefan constant.

Then, the spherically averaged photosphere temperature is given by,

Tyne = [Lxsa/ (4038 R 2,0) - (8)
6 MENGQI ET AL.

Since the ejecta produced by planetary engulfment is highly non-spherical, the radial luminosity
only represents a crude total energy output from the event. To compute the observed flux, for example
along the «-direction, fy = L,/(4mD*), where D is the distance to the observer, we determine the
location of the photosphere in the x-direction using

/ ” paee— 1, (9)

on a grid in the yz plane (perpendicular to the line-of-sight). Then the “x-luminosities” are given by

Le, o = 4a / | dydzBy(Tono, x); (10a)
L,=4 | | dydzospT ho: (10b)

where Tyho, x (which depends on y, z) is the z-photosphere temperature. The observed luminosities
from other directions (e.g., y- and z- directions) can be obtained similarly.

2.3. Mass loss calculation

When the planet penetrates the star’s envelope, it drives gas ejection through shock. A fraction of
the ejected gas is unbound. We compute the cumulative runaway gas at different radius r over time
using

AMtot (t) = [oe [owe sin 6déd¢, (11)

where p and v, are the gas density and radial velocity. To determine the amount of unbound gas, we
evaluate the Bernoulli parameter B of the gas and require it to be positive. Thus

AMunp (t) = ful pu,r? sin 6dédd, (12)
B>0
The Bernoulli parameter is defined as
1
B= ght + po tut P, (13)

where v is gas velocity, @ is the gravitational potential, and u = P/ (y — 1) is the gas internal energy
density.

2.4. Analytical model for planet trajectory

To compare with our numerical results, we use a semi-analytic model for the planet’s motion that
includes a simplified gravitational force and dynamical friction:

F=Fo+F,, (14)
with

Fo = —GMyencMpr/r*, (15a)
F, = C,7R2pvvy, (15b)
ECCENTRIC ORBITAL PLANETARY ENGULFMENT ir

where M,enc(r) is the stellar mass enclosed by the planet’s orbit at radius r, p is the local stellar
density and R, = 2GM,/v? is the Bondi-Hoyle radius. The dimensionless coefficient C, is given by

the Coulomb logarithm,
C, = In (==) F (16)

where Snax and Sin correspond to the maximum and minimum impact parameters of the interac-
tion (Ostriker 1999). Following Thun et al. (2016), we use the stand-off distance of the shock R,, for
Smith?

where R, is the planetary radius (or the softening length of the planet), and 7 is a nonlinearity
parameter given by

2 M?—1R,’
We set y = 5/3 and the corresponding factor g(y) = 1, and M = v,/c, is the mach number of planet.
There are some uncertainties in the value of Si,ax for inhomogeneous medium (The Ostriker (1999)
formula applies to homogeneous medium). In general, we can write

n= (18)

vie

Sinax = Lint [M?/(M? — 1)] (19)
where Ling is the effective interaction distance. For nearly circular trajectory, Lin, ~ ./ R2 — 1? could
be adopted. This overestimates the interacting distance in the stratified envelope. O’Connor et al.
(2023) adopted the density scale hight Lint ~ Hp, = p/|dpe/dr|. However, since the bending bow shock
is not aligned with the local density gradient, using Lin, ~ H, underestimates Sax. An improved
estimate for Lint is to use the density gradient in the direction of v, i-e., Lins ~ Hp,o = p/|0- Vol:
For nearly circlar orbit, we have

Using Eq. 14, the planetary trajectory can be integrated using fourth order Runge-Kutta method in
the orbital plane, with same initial conditions and stellar profile (non-evolving) as in the simulation.
Three different choices of Sinax are used for the drag force coefficients. The comparison of the semi-
analytical results with the simulation result is shown in Section 3.2.

the fiducial simulation. The left two columns correspond to the first planet-star encounter, followed by
snapshots during the planet’s spiral-in and after its disruption. The stellar core is marked by a large white
circle, while the planet is indicated by a white (black) circle in the upper (lower) panels. The grid scale
corresponds to 1 R,, as shown by the white scale bar in the first panel. The time unit is tayn, given by Eq. 1.

Figure 2 shows slices of the stellar gas density and temperature through the orbital plane. After
the planet enters the stellar envelope, it drives density disturbances (wakes) via gravity. Due to
the planet’s supersonic motion, the wakes steepen into shocks as they propagate. When the wake
breaks out of the stellar surface, it ejects stellar envelope gas. At the shock front, kinetic energy is
converted into internal energy, producing radiation (Metzger et al. 2012; Stephan et al. 2020). The
typical temperature of the shocked gas is on the order of a few x 104K, generating an ultraviolet (UV)
transient (see below). After several planet-star encounters, the stellar envelope becomes puffed up,
and quasi-periodic spiral-like shocks form once per orbital period (which itself decreases over time).

Figure 3 presents the spherically averaged profiles of density, pressure, temperature, and sound
speed. As the stellar gas is disturbed, the envelope expands (“puffs up” ), resulting in increased density
and pressure beyond the original stellar radius, R,. Following the planetary disruption, fallback of
ejecta occurs, as indicated by the reduced density and pressure outside the star at t = 248.9 tayn (see
the dark blue profile). The gas velocity profiles, shown alongside the sound speed, reveal that the
ejecta flow is subsonic at most radii, although the outermost regions exhibit supersonic flow. The
peaks in the velocity profile correspond to quasi-periodic shocks within the ejecta.

speed profiles. In the bottom right panel, the spherically averaged gas velocity is shown alongside the sound
speed. Different times are indicated by color.

3.2. Orbital decay

The temporal evolution of the planet’s orbital distance from the stellar center is shown in Figure
4 (blue line, top panels). Before the planet fully descends onto the stellar surface, the apocenter
distance decreases quasi-linearly, while the pericenter distance remains nearly constant. We therefore
characterize the orbital decay rate by the rate of decrease of the apocenter distance, |7*ap.|. In the
fiducial model, this rate is ~ 0.012 R,/tayn- Once the planet is entirely submerged beneath the stellar
surface, the pericenter distance begins to decline as the drag force increases sharply at greater depths
within the envelope. After several orbits, the planet reaches the inner edge of the simulation domain
(at 0.3.R,, dashed line in Figure 4). At this point, we artificially set the planet’s mass to zero to halt
its motion, resulting in a constant orbital distance thereafter.

Recall that in our fiducial simulation, we treat the planet as a gravity source with softening length
R, = 0.05 R,. To test the robustness of our result, we have performed additional simulations with
different values of R,, the results are shown in Figure 5 along with the semi-analytic results. Even
though the results from Athena++ simulations display a cut-off when R, matches the smallest grid
size Ar = 0.01 R,, all other orbital decay rates exhibit a linear decrease in relation to the increasing
Ry

As detailed in Section 2.4, we integrate orbital trajectories under varying drag force coefficients.
For a constant coefficient, the orbital decay rate exhibits a linear dependence on the coefficient; for

We show the spherically averaged radial luminosity, photospheric radius, and effective tempera-
ture obtained using both the analytic opacity formula and the MESA opacity tables in Fig.4. The
photospheric properties are calculated at every hydrodynamics output, with a time interval of about
0.3tayn- As a check for our method, we compare the computed bolometric luminosity and pho-
tospheric temperature prior to the planet-star interaction, when the host star is the same as the
1D result from MESA. The luminosity and photospheric temperature are L, = 1.06 x 10° Lo and
Tee = 3319K, respectively, differing slightly from the MESA values (see Section 2.1) due to the
resolution difference between the two grids and the relaxation procedure. After the planet interacts

with the host star, the photospheric properties exhibit similar evolutionary stages: onset”, hot peak,
and plateau. The light curve obtained with the MESA opacity tables additionally shows a late-time
dimming phase due to dust formation.

During the onset stage, the planet penetrates the stellar envelope, driving shocks through gravity.
These shocks eject gas and enhance the stellar luminosity. The shocked ejecta exhibit a character-
istic temperature of approximately 2 x 10‘K (first row of Fig. 6), consistent with the strong-shock
assumption from the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions:

where Up out = GM, (2/R, — 1/a) ~ 4x 108 cms™t is the planet’s velocity upon coming outside the
stellar surface. During this onset phase, as the shock wave propagates through the stellar envelope,
the spherically averaged photospheric temperature gradually increases while the photospheric radius
remains close to the initial stellar radius.

The hot peak stage begins after the planet has encountered the star approximately three to four
times, during which the luminosity rises to a few times 10° L,. As the shocked ejecta expands, the
photospheric temperature decreases due to adiabatic cooling. A notable feature of this stage is the
quasi-periodic hot peaks, originating from shock formation during successive planet-star encounters.

? We do not use the term “plunge-in”, which is commonly adopted in the literature. For circular planetary engulfment
or common envelope evolution with negligible secondary eccentricity, “plunge-in” refers to the initial phase of the
rapid orbital decay. A reasonable indicator of this phase is when the ratio of the orbital period to the orbital decay
timescale lies in the range of 0.01 < Porp/(a/|a|) < 0.1 (Ivanova et al. 2020). In the eccentric case, this occurs only
after the secondary is fully embedded within the stellar envelope.
ECCENTRIC ORBITAL PLANETARY ENGULFMENT 13

The shocked gas is ejected as the planet spirals inward, eventually surpassing the expanding photo-
sphere. As the spiral-arm-shaped shocked ejecta cools and becomes optically thin, the underlying
inner quasi-spherical, adiabatically expanding gas becomes visible, as illustrated in the bottom row
of Figure 6.

The plateau stage begins as a result of hydrogen recombination, a hallmark feature in the light
curves of common-envelope events (CEEs) (Ivanova et al. 2013). In models using the MESA opacity,
the photospheric temperature during the plateau is lower, approximately 6000 K, reflecting the fact
that recombination occurs at lower temperatures in low-density regions (see Section 2.2), whereas
models with analytical opacity show a photospheric temperature around 104K. During this stage,
the photosphere begins to recede. The quasi-periodic hot peaks disappear, when the planet is fully
disrupted at t ¥ 170 tayn.

The dimming stage begins with dust formation in the more distant, cooling gas. Dust forms
below temperatures of approximately 1000 K, increasing the opacity to about 1 cm? g~! and thereby
obscuring thermal emission from the hot ejecta (Hatfull & Ivanova 2025). We propose that shocks
driven by the spiraling-in planet may destroy dust grains in the low-temperature gas, leading to a
more gradual dimming of the light curve.

Since the mass ejection is highly nonspherical, the observed radiation depends on the viewing angle.
Figure 6 presents three-view projections of the photospheric temperature alongside an equirectangular
projection of the radial line-of-sight photosphere temperature. Shortly after the first interaction at
t = 10.9tayn (upper panels), the wake shock appears as a spiral-shaped high-temperature region
propagating along the equatorial plane following the planet. Much later, as the ejecta expands
quasi-spherically at t = 185.1 tayn (lower panels), a faster-propagating shock surpasses the expanded
photosphere. Once this shock becomes optically thin, the spherically expanding photosphere emerges,
giving rise to luminosity modulation.

The light curves from three observing directions are shown in the bottom panels of Figure 4. The
observer lines of sight correspond to the +2, +y, and +z directions, respectively. The luminosities
are normalized by L, to enable direct comparison with the radially averaged luminosities, which
are also plotted in the same panels as red lines. The observed luminosities from different directions
generally agree with the radial luminosity for both opacity models. Three-dimensional effects are most
pronounced during shock propagation, causing peak delays especially in L; and L,. The luminosity
along the +z direction, L,, is lower than the other two for the first few orbits, primarily due to the
smaller projected area of the shocked region.

3.4. Mass loss

The left panels of Figure 7 show the cumulative ejected gas mass, unbound mass, and unbound
fraction at different reference radii. The planet’s orbital energy deposited into the stellar envelope
ejects gas from the gravitational potential well. Gas with a positive Bernoulli parameter tends to
stream freely to infinity if unimpeded by further collisions, while gas with negative Bernoulli gathers
in the circumstellar environment around the star.

The total ejected mass grows exponentially to approximately (2-3) x 10~ Mj before the planet
disrupts, then increases roughly linearly to (4-6) x 107? Mj at a nearly constant mass-loss rate
thereafter. The unbound mass exhibits a similar behavior, with a “step” feature at radii larger than
4 R, shortly after planet disruption. The unbound mass fraction, 7 = AMunp/AMtot, rapidly declines
before settling to an approximately constant value after 50 tayn. The higher unbound mass fraction

observed at larger radii suggests that a portion of the unbound gas decelerates or stalls at smaller
radii.

We note that the mass of the ejected gas continuous to increase at the end of our simulation due
to the computation time constraint. For example, the amount of total ejected mass AM;ot grows at
arate of ~ 1 x 107° Mo/ tayn for all the reference radii. The unbound mass AM,» grows at a rate
of ~ 4x 10-6 Mo/tayn, with decreasing fraction of unbound mass for larger radii. Thus, we can only
place a lower limit on the full amount of the ejected mass in our simulation.

keeping all other parameters fixed. The corresponding apocenter and ballistic pericenter distances are

a weaker dynamical friction. Consequently, the orbital decay deposits energy into the stellar envelope
more gradually.

We show the orbital decay and observable properties in Figure 8. The orbital decay is slower than
in the fiducial case (e = 0.65); the planet takes over 200tayn to fully descend beneath the stellar
surface and more than 280tgy, to be disrupted. The orbital decay rate defined in Section 3.2 is
approximately 0.003 R./tayn, about four times slower.
16 MENGQI ET AL.

The light curve exhibits similar features to the fiducial case. The onset phase lasts roughly three
orbits before reaching the first peak, with an average photospheric temperature near 2 x 104K, com-
parable to the fiducial model. From Eq.(22), the shock temperature associated with the planet’s
velocity coming out from the stellar surface, Upour = \/GM, (2/R, — 1/a), is independent of the ec-
centricity. Another notable difference is that the quasi-periodic peaks in luminosity and photospheric
radius seen in the fiducial case are weaker here, possibly because the lower-energy shocks dissipate
more rapidly. With the MESA opacity tables, we do not observe the rapid dimming of the light
curve, suggesting that dust formation in the hot ejecta is suppressed within our simulation time, as
he planet disruption occurs shortly before our simulation ends.

The mass loss is shown in the right panel of Figure 7. Before the planet fully plunges beneath
che stellar surface, the mass-loss rate is slower than in the fiducial case, reflecting the more gradual
deposition of orbital energy into the stellar envelope. After the planet is completely embedded
within the envelope, the orbital radius decreases rapidly in a manner similar to the plunge-in phase
Ohlmann et al. 2016a; Ivanova et al. 2020), during which mass loss is enhanced. By the end of the
simulation, the cumulative ejected mass is comparable to that of the fiducial case at small reference
radii; however, the fraction of unbound mass is smaller, with the unbound ejecta mass remaining
elow 1.5 x 1078 Mo.

5. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

We have performed three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamics simulations of an eccentric planet in-
teracting with and eventually being engulfed by a red giant host star, using the Athena ++ code.
The light curve and mass loss are computed in post-processing. The local gas temperature at the
photosphere (optical depth 7 = 1) is used to estimate the thermal emission. Mass loss is calculated
by integrating the mass flux through spherical surfaces at various radii outside the star. Our re-
sults suggest that such planetary engulfment can produce transients resembling luminous red novae
(LRNe), one of which has been previously identified as the engulfment of a giant planet in a circular
orbit by its main-sequence host star (De et al. 2023; Lau et al. 2025b).

Our main findings are:

e The direct interaction of planet with its host giant star after a sudden eccentricity excitation
can lead to the engulfment of planet.

e During the multiple planet-star encounters, the disturbances produced by the planet’s gravity
steepen into shocks and eject the gas of the stellar envelope. The thermal emission of the gas
brightens the stellar luminosity by serval orders of magnitudes.

e The light curves exhibit similar characteristics as luminous red novae (LRNe). During the initial
engulfment, the stellar luminosity rapidly increases within a few orbits. During the “hot-peak”
stage, the luminosity gradually decreases as the photosphere expands. A long plateau phase
follows with nearly constant temperature when the hydrogen recombination happens. The
rapid dimming phase occurs as dusts form at temperatures below ~ 1000 K.

e Due to the quasi-periodic planet-star interactions with the planet’s elliptical orbit, wake shocks
eject the stellar envelope in quasi-periodic manner, leading to quasi-periodic peaks in the lu-
minosity and photospheric radius.

e The ejected mass is roughly a few x107* Mz for a5 M, planet engulfed by 1 Mj red-giant star
from our simulation. Some of the gas stay in the circum-stellar environment, and less than 50%
of the ejected mass become unbound.

e By comparing with 3D hydrodynamics simulation, we find a reasonable expression of the coef-
ficient of the gravitational dynamical friction force for the stratified star.

The primary limitation of our simulations is the omission of radiation transport. For a low-mass
red giant, the thermal timescale is many orders of magnitude longer than the orbital decay timescale,
making radiation transport within the stellar interior negligible. Within the ejecta, however, the local
radiation diffusion timescale can be short, especially where the optical depth is less than unity. In
this regime, the thermal energy carried by radiation is non-negligible, and radiation transport could
modify the ejecta temperature, thereby affecting the predicted observational signatures.

During the ejecta expansion, radiative loss can reduce the thermal energy, which in return decreases
he mass-loss rate. Consequently, the sustained mass loss predicted in our calculation—similar to
chat found in previous work (Lau et al. 2025a)—may be suppressed. However, radiation transport is
unlikely to have a significant dynamical impact on the orbital decay (Lau et al. 2025a).

Although hydrogen recombination appears as a long plateau in the light curve, it is not included in
he equation of state (EoS) used in the hydrodynamics simulations or the post-processing temperature
calculations. Chen & Ivanova (2024) studied common-envelope evolution by comparing different EoS
and found that neglecting realistic EoS and radiation forces leads to faster light-curve dimming and
luminosities reduced by up to a factor of a few. Lau et al. (2022b) also found that including hydrogen
and helium recombination in EoS leads to tens of percent more mass loss. Therefore, our simulation
might underestimate the mass loss.

Dust formation plays a key role in shaping the observational signatures of planetary engulfment
events, as it can produce a prolonged infrared emission phase (De et al. 2023; Hatfull & Ivanova
2025). As explored in this work using the MESA opacity tables, dust formation in the cooling ejecta
can obscure the radiation from the hot material, resulting in a rapid late-time decline in the light
curve. These dusts, however, may be destroyed by the quasi-periodic shocked ejecta. More detailed
modeling of dust formation and destruction is required when applying theoretical predictions to
interpret real observations.

In our simulations, we artificially disrupt the planet once it reaches the inner boundary at 0.3 R,.
However, the planet could potentially survive much longer. When the planet’s internal temperature
rises such that the sound speed exceeds its surface escape velocity, dissolution begins (Livio & Soker
1984). However, considering the limited heat transport via conduction and radiation, which leads
to heating timescales much longer than the predicted in-spiral time (Guillot et al. 1996; O’Connor
et al. 2023), the planet is expected to survive within the stellar envelope until it fills its Roche lobe,
at which point it undergoes rapid tidal disruption (Reyes-Ruiz & Lépez 1999).

During engulfment, the planet can drive differential rotation and turbulence in the stellar envelope,
conditions favorable for magnetic field amplification via a dynamo mechanism. A few MHD simu-
lations have investigated magnetic field amplification during the common-envelope phase (Ohlmann
et al. 2016b; Ondratschek et al. 2022; Gagnier & Pejcha 2024), consistently finding strong amplifica-
tion. However, since no simulations have addressed the case of a low-mass companion, the efficiency
of magnetic field amplification during planetary engulfment remains uncertain. If the stellar magnetic
field is indeed amplified, it could drive a magnetically powered stellar wind (Soker 1998). Nonethe-

less, Ohlmann et al. (2016b) found that in the common-envelope phase the dynamical impact of the
magnetic field is modest, with mass loss enhanced by only 5-6% during the first orbit.

The initial motivation of this study is to understand observable features of the ZTF SLRN-2020
event, interpreted as the engulfment of a giant planet by a red giant in circular orbit. Because of
the large eccentricity, our modeled system exhibits a greater luminosity, driven by quasi-periodic
shocks and mass ejections. In a circular orbit scenario, envelope ejection is expected during surface
interactions—provided the thermal timescale is sufficiently short and the interaction is dynamically
significant. In contrast, an eccentric orbit facilitates enhanced mass loss, and yields brighter emission
and prolonged UV-optical radiation.
