Abstract

We establish the existence of a single-parameter family of the concave kite
central configurations in the 4-body problem with two pairs of equal masses. In
such configurations, one pair of the masses must lie on the base of an isosceles
triangle, and the other pair on its symmetric axis with one mass positioned
inside the triangle formed by the other three. Using a rigorous computer-
assisted analytical approach, we prove that for any non-negative mass ratio,
the number of such configurations is either zero, one, or two, which can be
viewed as a complete classification of this particular family. Furthermore, we
show that the unique configuration corresponding to a specific mass ratio is a
fold-type bifurcation point within the reduced subspace. We also give a clear
and complete bifurcation picture for both symmetric and asymmetric cases of
this concave type in the whole planar 4-body configuration space.

1 Introduction

is the Newtonian potential and r;; = |g; — qj| is the mutual distance between the bodies
m, and m,;.

This set of equations possesses a kind of special solutions called homographic solutions,
namely, each body moves on a similar Keplerian orbit, and the configuration remains the
same up to symmetries. This particular shape is called a central configuration

equations (2) are invariant under translation, dilation, and rotation, and we say two
central configurations are equivalent if they can be transformed from one to another by
combining the above three operations.

The first two central configurations are found by Euler and Lagrange, who respectively
constructed two classes of homographic solutions for the 3-body problem. These two
central configurations are now named after them. In fact, according to Wintner [42], they
are the only two types of central configurations of the 3-body problem. Similar questions
are raised for the general case, which is known as the finiteness conjecture [8,39, 42]: For
any given n positive masses, the number of equivalent classes of central configurations of
the n-body problem is finite. The conjecture holds for n = 4 [16], and for n = 5,6, only
generic results have been derived [3,7, 15]. Less is known for n > 7. It also holds for
some very particular shapes, such as the Moulton collinear central configurations [28] for
n bodies, and some equal mass cases [1, 20, 25].

In the 4-body problem, despite a rich body of research, a complete and precise clas-
sification of central configurations remains unavailable. The convex case, however, is
comparatively better understood. MacMillan and Bartky established the existence of a
convex central configuration for any four ordered masses [23], with an alternative proof
provided later by Xia [43]. Regarding the uniqueness aspect, while Sim6 and Yoccoz ad-
dressed the problem, a rigorous mathematical proof is still lacking, with support limited
to numerical evidence. The existence and the uniqueness conjecture has been confirmed
for several specific convex shapes [11,34,35,44]. Sun, Xie, and You [40] recently made a
closed step forward, giving a proof for masses sufficiently bounded away from zero. The
characterization of the convex case with partial equal masses has been thoroughly estab-
lished [2, 13,31], and Corbera, Cors, and Roberts have achieved a complete classification
of the convex 4-body central configurations [9].

For the concave 4-body central configurations, the classification remains unresolved,
despite the proof of their existence [14]. The solutions for the concave shapes with some

partial equal masses were mentioned or discussed in [5, 21,37]. In addition, a simple
degenerate concave central configuration in the 4-body problem was discovered by Palmore
[30], which facilitated studies on the bifurcation problems of central configurations [6, 19,
24, 38].

A non-collinear central configuration is called a kite shape if it has a symmetry axis
passing through two of the four masses. It is strictly convex if each body lies in the
exterior of the convex hull formed by the other three; otherwise, it is strictly concave.
There is no such central configuration satisfying only three of the four bodies are collinear,
according to the Perpendicular Bisector Theorem (i.e., Lemma 1 in this paper). If a
convex central configuration has two opposite equal masses, it must be a kite [2, 22].
Furthermore, it is actually a rhombus according to the study by Bernat, Llibre, and
Pérez-Chavela. For the kite shape with three equal masses, Bernat et al. [6] gave a
full classification. Corbera and Llibre [10] gave a complete description of the families of
central configurations with two pairs of equal masses and two equal masses sufficiently
small. Santoprete [36] characterized the kite shape in terms of mutual distances. Roberts
[32] showed the existence and uniqueness of the convex kite shape, and discussed the
corresponding bifurcation and linear stability.

In this paper, we focus on the concave central configurations of the 4-body problem.
We present a nice characterization of the kite shape with two pairs of equal masses. We
establish analytically in Theorem 1 that such concave kite central configurations constitute
a single-parameter family. Then we employ interval arithmetic and the Krawczyk operator
to establish a rigorous, computer-assisted proof for the complete classification of this
concave kite configuration, as presented in Theorem 2.

Theorem 1. Suppose that the planar 4-body central configuration is a concave kite shape
with two pairs of equal masses. Then, one pair of the two must lie on the base of an
isosceles triangle, and the other pair lies along the symmetry axis, with one body inside
the triangle formed by the other three. Together, these concave kite central configurations
constitute a single-parameter family.

Remark 1. Geometrically, this family of central configurations is fully parameterized
by the small blue triangle Ajo3 in Figure 1. Specifically, this small triangle deforms
continuously from a degenerate triangle position with m,,m2 and m3 collinear, to an
equilateral triangle. Correspondingly, the angle 7312 = 2321 increases from 0 to 7/3.

Theorem 2. Suppose that the concave kite central configurations possess two pairs of
equal masses, with my = mz = 1 on the base and mg = m4 = m > 0 on the symmetry
axis. Then

1. there are precisely two types of concave kite central configurations if m € (0, mo);
2. there is only one if m= mo;
3. there is no such kite central configuration if m > mo,

where mo & 1.002713329037083.

Furthermore, if m = 0 is admissible, there are exactly two types of central configura-
tions. In both, m1,m2 and m4 form an equilateral triangle convex hull, and m3 is located
either on the midpoint of m, and mg, or it coincides with m4.
Figure 1: A symmetric planar central configu-
ration in the concave 4-body problem with two
pairs of equal masses, where m, = mz are lo-
cated on the base and m3 = mz, on its symmet-
ric axis with m3 inside the triangle formed by
the other three.

Our results improve and extend those of Martha and Llibre [5] for the same concave
kite shape. While their study assumed the mass ratio 0 < m < 1, we demonstrate that
the configuration can be continued tom = mo > 1 and m = 0. Similar discussion can
be found in [41,44] for the convex cases with two pairs of equal masses, i.e., the isosceles
trapezoid and the rhombus central configurations, and in both cases, the mass ratio ranges
in [0,1] by normalizing the larger pair of masses to be 1.

Our study further examines the bifurcations of the concave configurations with two
pairs of equal masses. In contrast to the analysis in [33], Theorem 2 establishes the
critical threshold mp beyond which the bifurcation branch ceases to continue. We also
demonstrate that the unique solution at m = mp represents the only fold bifurcation
point in this symmetric subspace, differing from the bifurcation structure in the entire
planar configuration space of the 4-body problem. Building on the results from [10,33],
as well as our study, we can establish a complete bifurcation picture for concave central
configurations with two pairs of equal masses when the symmetry axis is fixed. The
complete picture is illustrated in Figure 3.8, with the corresponding numerical examples in
Table 3.1. As the mass parameter m increases from 0 to oo, symmetric solutions emerge in
pairs. When m passes through a pitchfork bifurcation point at m, + 0.992299447752385,
pairs of asymmetric solutions appear. Finally, when m reaches mo, the two symmetric
solutions coalesce and then vanish for m > mo, leaving the asymmetric solutions as the
only remaining ones.

The whole paper is constructed as follows. In the next section, we introduce some
necessary results used in this paper, including the Perpendicular Bisector Theorem, basic
theories and settings for the interval arithmetic and the Krawczyk operator, as well as
the related bifurcation theory. In Section 3 we prove Theorem 1 and 2. At the end of
Section 3, we discuss the bifurcations of this concave central configurations with two pairs
of equal masses.

2 Preparations

The following result is widely used in determining the possible positions of the bodies in
a planar central configuration.

Lemma 1 (Perpendicular Bisector Theorem, [26]). Let q be a planar central configu-
ration and let q, and q; be any two of its points. Then, if one of the two open cones
determined by the line through q and q; and its perpendicular bisector contains points of
the configuration, so does the other one.

2.1 The interval arithmetic method and the Krawczyk operator

Suppose that F(x): D Cc RY > R* is a C' function with « € RY. We aim to solve the
equation
F(x) =0. (3)

We use interval analysis to find zeros of (3). The basic theory, including the interval arith-
metic and the Krawezyk operator, can be found in [4,17, 27,29], as well as its applications
in central configurations [25, 33, 40].

Let [2] C R* be a closed interval. We denote by R(F;[z]) = {F(x) : x € [x]} the
range of F over [a] and F({x]) the final interval under the interval computation. A simple
but essential property of the interval arithmetic is

R(F; [2]) € F([2]). (4)

The Krawczyk operator is based on the modified Newton operator and the Brouwer fixed-
point theorem. The derivative, namely, the Jacobian matrix of F' at x, is denoted by
DF (x). If DF() is non-singular, we define the Krawczyk operator of F as the following:

K (to, [e]) =e» — C- F(a) + Id — C - DF((a)([2] — 20), (5)

where C € R%* jis a linear isomorphism. The properties of this operator are listed as
follows

Lemma 2. 1. Jf x* € [x] and F(x*) = 0, then x* € K(2o, [a])-

2. If K (xo, [x]) C int|z], then there exists exactly one solution of equation F(x) = 0 in
[x]. This solution is non-degenerate with DF(«) an isomorphism.

3. If K(x, [x]) 9 [x] = 2, then for all x € [x] we have F(x) £0.

We can write a program in SageMath [12] to find zeros of (3). The main idea of
the program is to cut the N—dimensional interval into small enough pieces and find
zero on these pieces one by one. The property (4) and the definition (5), together with
Lemma 2, guarantee that this computer-assisted interval approach is rigid in mathematics.
This approach has been successfully applied in [40] to partially solve the existence and
uniqueness conjecture for the planar convex 4-body central configurations, in which we can
find very explicit and detailed information for the arithmetic. In contrast, our program
is similar, but simpler and efficient, since in this paper, N equals 1 or 2, which makes it
easy to iterate and calculate. We apply the program in Section 3 in the proofs of Lemma
4 and Theorem 2 to analyze the zeros of the corresponding equations respectively. Then
we use it again to discuss the bifurcations.

Suppose that

is a smooth map and p is a parameter. We follow the notation in Subsection 2.1, that
DF(c) is the Jacobian of F' with respect to x. We use F,, to denote the vector of partial
derivatives of the components of F' with respect to jz. Consider the system F(x, js) = 0.
When yp varies, the number of its solutions may change, implying bifurcations in the
system. The following theorem can be seen as the definition of different bifurcations for
simple eigenvalues. One can refer to [18] for more information, as well as to [33] for a
particular application in central configurations.

Theorem 3. Suppose that F(xo, lo) = 0, and the Jacobian matrix Jp = DF (29, Wo) has
a simple eigenvalue Ao = 0 with eigenvector v. Denote by w the adjoint eigenvector, 1.e.,
JfPw =0, where JF is the transpose of Jr.

3 The symmetric central configurations in the con-
cave 4-body problem with two pairs of equal masses

We show in the following that the only position of a concave kite central configuration
with two pairs of equal masses is the one shown in Figure 1. In other words, one pair
of the equal masses must lie on the base of an isosceles triangle, and the other pair lies
on the symmetry axis of the base, with one mass inside the triangle formed by the other
three. Let

T13 = @,T14 = b
and rj2 = 2. The central configuration equations can be written under the position
coordinates as

Proposition 1. Suppose that a concave kite central configuration for the 4-body problem
with two pairs of equal masses possesses mass values 1 and m. Then one pair of the
equal masses must lie on the base of an isosceles triangle, and the other pair lies on the
symmetry axis of the base, with one mass inside the triangle formed by the other three.

Proof. The proposition holds for m = 1 according to the two concave equal mass central
configurations in [1], ie., one possesses an equilateral triangle convex hull, and the other
one possesses an isosceles triangle shape.

If m ¥ 1, we suppose that my = m4 = 1 and my = m3 = m. Substituting the masses
and (8) into (7) and after some simplification we obtain six equations

From the sum of the first two equations, we have
(m— 1)(—4A +m +1)
4(m + 1)

which implies A = (m+ 1)/4. Substituting it into the third and the fourth equations we
have

=0,

_ (a = 8) (m=)

v= 8a
— (b? — 8) (m—1)
7 8b?
which implies a = b = 2 since m # 1, contradicting to the assumption. Almost in the
same way, we derive the same contradiction when m; = m3 = 1 and mg = m4 = m.
Therefore, the only way to deposite the masses is m, = m2 and m3 = m4, as shown in
Figure 1.

Substituting the masses and positions in (8) into (7) and with some simplification we

Noticing that the fourth equation is equivalent to the sum of the second and third equa-

tions, we can substitute \ derived from the first equation into the second and third ones
and reduce them, then get the following three equations:

92 <a Ve— 1)? 7 a 4b3

From (10b) we obtain

a? — 1(a3 — 8)b?(Va? — 1 — Ve? — 1)?

From (10b) and (10c) we obtain a mass-free equation
ab — 1(b8 — 8) (68 + (Va2 — 1 — VP — 1)3)+
D8 Va? — 1(a3 — 8)(a3 + (Va? = 1 — VP? =1)) = 0.

First, we characterize a and b from Lemma 1.

(11)

Corollary 1. Suppose that (a,b) is a solution for (10a)-(10c), satisfying a < b. Then we
have a € I4 = (1,2) and b € Ip = (V2, V2(V3 +1)) form > 0. More precisely, we have
the following:

L. If V2 <b <2, then1 <a<rgq < 2/V3 and m > 0.
2. Ifb =2, thena=2/V3 andm =1.
3. If2<b< V2(V3 +1), then 2/V3 < 134 <a <2 andm>0.
In addition, if m= 0 is admissible, then b = 2, anda =1 or 2.

Proof. Firstly, by substituting 6 = 2 into (10c), we obtain m = 0 or a = 2/3. Then,
substituting m = 0 into (10b), we get a = 1 or a = 2; substituting a = 2/3 into (10b),
we get m= 1.

Secondly, we claim that a < 2 holds. Otherwise, suppose that a > 2. As shown in
Figure 3.2, the red dashed line characterizes the equilateral triangle, and A; is the apex.
Then ms is directly above A; and mz, is directly above m3. The blue dashed line is the
perpendicular bisector of r13. The region in blue denotes one of the cones divided by the
two blue lines. We can clearly see that m4 and mz will always lie in the blue region, which
implies that it cannot be a central configuration when a > 2.

Thirdly, as shown in Figure 3.3, we assume that the center of the equilateral triangle
is A. The intersection of r;4 and its perpendicular bisector is Ag, and the intersection of
this perpendicular bisector and the symmetry axis is A3. The right triangle Am,A2A3 is
similar to AA;m,O. Then we have

ma Ag miA3

m4O mam

which implies m4A3 = 0?/(2Vb? — 1).

e When b < 2, As is directly below A. Then mg lies in the grey cone shown in Figure
3.3. This implies mg is directly below A3, namely, i.e., m3O0 < A30 < AO. From
the first and the third terms, we have rj3 = a < Am, = 2 J/3. From the former
inequality, we have Va?—1 < Vb? —1— b?/(2Vb? —1), ie, Va? -1V0?-1 <
(b? — 2)/2, which implies b > V/2.

e Similarly, when b > 2, mo is not in the grey cone, and m30 > A30 > AO, ie.,
Va—1 > Ve 1 - 0?/(2Ve—1) > 1/V3. From the first and the third term,
we have a > 2/./3. The first inequality implies that rj3 > rga, ie., Vb? -—1 <
a+ Va? —1<2+4+¥3. Then b < /2(V/3 +1) with a < 2.

Now let
Va? — 1(a? — 8)
=
a® ,
a, =(Va? — 1 — Vb? — 1)? +03, (12)
_VP—1(83 — 8)
~ bs ,
yr =(Va? — 1 — Vb? — 1)? +0.
Then m in (11) can be written as
m=", (13)
a

where w, = a3b4(/a? — 1 — V/b? — 1)?/4 > 0. The mass-free equation can be written as
rr, + yy, = 0. (14)

We claim that the following inequalities hold.

p(z) = —22° + 32° + 402? — 48 = 0. (17)

Proof. For (15), It is easy to see that  < 0 when 1 < a < 2. Ifa < b, then from the
obtuse triangle Am,m m3 shown in Figure 1, we find that rj4 is the longest side, which
implies ry4 > ga, ie., yr > 0. If a > b, y: > 0 holds obviously.

For (16), by direct computation, we have

It is easy to see that Ox, /0b < 0. For the second inequality, we have

A(y- y1) Oy Oy

We consider three cases.

Firstly, when a < 2 < b < V2(V34 1), we have y > 0. We aim to show that
Oy/Ob, Oy, /Ob are both positive, and this implies O(yy,)/0b > 0. The parenthesis in the
numerator of Oy,/Ob satisfies bb? — 1 — (Va? — 1 — Vb? — 1)? > Vb? — i (Ja? —1-
Vb = 1)? = Va? — 1(2\V/0? — 1 — Va? — 1) > 0. Meanwhile, for the numerator of dy/db,

10
without much difficulty, we compute the derivatives of p(b) till the third order. p'”(b) =
18 — 1200? < 0 in (2, V2(V3 + 1)), and this implies p’(b) = 80 + 18b — 400? is decreasing
in (2,V2(V3 + 1)). We compute p”(2) = —204, which implies p’(b) is decreasing in
(2, V2(V3 + 1)). In addition, p'(2.14) > 0 and p/(2.15) < 0 implies p(b) has a unique
maximum in (2.14,2.15). From p(2.75) > 0 and p(2.76) < 0 we find that p(b) has a
unique zero by € (2.75, 2.76). So, for 2 <b < by, we have Oy/Ob > 0.

Secondly, for the case 2 < b < 2, we claim

oie . (b' VB —1) (2h, ty: Oh VP 1) = ky thy + ks + ha > 0,
D

where

ky =y1 - (3 — 2b°)(b? — 8),

ky =y, « (30° — 3)b?,

ky =y1 - (3 — 3b°)(b* — 8),

ky =(b(b? — 1) — Vb? — (Vb? —1 — Va? — 1)?) - 3b°(0? — 8).

It is obvious that k, and ky» are positive. Furthermore we have

keg + ky =3(b — 8)[(—(0 — 1))(0? — (Ve = 1 — Va? 19) +
BVP —1(bVP—1- (VP —1- Ve -1)”)]

=3(0° — 8)Ve2— 1(VeR —1- Ve? — 1)? (VR -1 — BP -— VR Vv? — 1)
=3(b° — 8) Vb? — 1(Vb? — 1 — Va? — 1)?(-1 — Va? — 1 Vb? — 1) > 0.

For the case b = 2, by direct computation we have y = 0 and Oy/0b > 0, which implies
O(yy1)/Ob > 0. Together with the above two cases, we complete the proof.

We denote by g(a, b) = xv, + yy.
Lemma 4. For any a € I, there exists a unique b = b(a) such that
1. g(a,b) <0 for V2 <b < dla),
2. g(a, b(a)) =0, and
3. g(a,b) > 0 for b(a) <b < 5/2.
Proof. On the one hand, g(a, V2) =

since the two parentheses in each term, i-e., ((Va2 — 1-1)? +2V2) > 0 and a3+(Va? — 1-

We apply the computer-assisted interval arithmetic introduced in Section 2.1 to

F = g(a,5/2) =0

11
to show rigorously that this single variable equation has no zero when a belongs to the
closure of I,, i.e., [4 = [1,2]. In addition, by direct computation, g(3/2,5/2) =

—15609375V/5 + 5558625./21 + 23836392,/105 — 230181064
22781250 0

which implies g(a,5/2) > 0 for all a € I4. Hence, by the Intermediate Value Theorem,
there exists at least one b € (V2,5/2) such that g(a, b) = 0.
On the other hand, from Lemma 3, for any a € I4 and b € (V2, 5/2) we have

Og 2 Oe _ y+ y1)
db Ob

> 0,

since 5/2 < b;. Hence, from the Implicit Function Theorem, b = b(a) is a differential
function for a € I4. The set

T = {(a,b)|9(a,6(a)) = 0,4 € La}

is a smooth curve on the (a, b)-plane; see the black dotted-dashed curve in Figure 3.4.
Lemma 5. g(a,b) = 0 has no zero in Ta x [5/2, V2(V3 + 1)].

Proof. We split each one-dimensional interval into 100 equal parts and obtain 104 subin-
tervals. We check whether possible zeros exist in each subinterval. For example, for one
of the subintervals 6 = [1,1.01] x [2.5,2.5 + (/2(V3 + 1) — 2.5)/100], we compute the
interval value of g(a, b) on this subinterval and obtain

g((L, 1.01], [2.5, 2.5 + (/2(V3 + 1) — 2.5)/100]) € [0.232, 11.623] 3 0.

Then, from the property (4) we know that 0 ¢ R(g(a,b);), which implies g(a, b) has no
zero on @. In a similar way, we deal with the other subintervals. Finally, we derive the
result.

The proof of Theorem 1. From Proposition 1 we know that the only position for a concave
kite shape with two pairs of equal masses is the one shown in Figure 1. From Lemma 4
we know that b = b(a) is uniquely determined by a € I4. By substituting b = 6(a) into
the expression of m in (11) we obtain

a8 in Ve? = 1(a — 8)6%(Va?—1 — VP? - 1)
4a3((Va? —1— Vb? — 1)3 + b)

which implies that 7m(a) is a positive differentiable function with respect to the only
variable a € I.

In conclusion, for any a € Ia, b = b(a) and m = m(a) are uniquely determined
successively. Hence, the concave kite central configurations in the planar 4-body problem
with two pairs of equal masses, as shown in Figure 3.5, form a single-parameter family
with the parameter a € I4.

maximum point of 6(a) is (a, 6(a)) = (1.5397067078739939865, 2.4488397355312008965). The maximum
point of 7n(a) is (a, 7(a)) = (1.1733802447932032924, 1.00271332903708271708).

3.2. The mass ratio m = m(a)

In this section, we prove Theorem 2. Using the computer-assisted interval arithmetic
introduced in Section 2.1, we show rigorously that the smooth function 7(a) possesses a
unique maximum m = mo when a € I4. We use Ig = (V2, 5/2) instead of Tg according
to Lemma 5. We denote by D = I, x Ig. Noticing that

dn(a) Om Om oa

da das Ob Z ,

We consider the equation F = (f1,g) = 0, where

0 om Og Om Og
Oa Ob Ob Oa
0 =g(a,b).

We aim to show F(a,b) = 0 has a unique solution in the interior of D. In fact, after
excluding most of the interval pieces, we lock a small interval Do = [1.1,1.2] x [2, 2.1]
containing possible zeros. The domain Dp is first partitioned by dividing each dimen-
sional interval into 100 equal parts. Each resulting subinterval is then evaluated with the
Krawczyk operator from the interval arithmetic program, and all subintervals found to
contain no zeros are excluded. Finally, we find the only solution (ao, bo) of (18) in

‘i €1.17338024479320329242 12633685? (19)

bo €2.036986393189520563373721634?

and the corresponding mass is m = mp = 1.00271332903708271708084572?. The question
mark in the end denotes a standard floating-point number with accuracy in SageMath. In
addition, from Lemma 4 we know that 0g/0b > 0 for (a,b) € D, which implies that din/da

13
has the same sign as f;. From Corollary 1 we know that the point (2/3, 2) is a solution
of g(a,b) = 0. Then by direct computation, we have f,(2/V3,2) = 6(2V3 — 3) > 0,
and this implies that 7(a) increases in (1, a9) and decreases in (ag, 2), since 2/V/3 < ao.
Hence, ag is the unique maximum of 7(a) in 14. One can see the green curve in Figure
3.4 for illustration.

Furthermore, we consider the limitations of 7n(a) when a approaches the two endpoints
of I4. Since dim b(a) = 2, and from the expression of m in (13), we find Jim, x=

1-—3V3 4 0. Similarly we have him b(a) = 2 and him a, = 8 #0. Then by direct
a+2- a>2-

computation we have

lim m(a)=0, lim m(a) =0,

alt a2-
and this implies that r(a) can be continued to 0 at a = 1 and a = 2 respectively,
coinciding with the result in Corollary 1. In other words, 7(a) continues on T4 = [1, 2].
Then the following claims hold directly

1. When m € (0, mo), the equation (a) = m has two solutions, and there are exactly
two concave kite central configurations with two pairs of equal masses.

2. When m = mo, the equation (a) = m has a unique solution, corresponding to a
unique concave kite central configuration.

3. When m > mo, no such central configurations exists at all.
4. Furthermore, if 7m = 0 is admissible, the equation m(a) = 0 has two solutions.

Figure 3.5 is provided for the solutions with different m. For example, the black lines
(both solid and dashed) describe the two central configurations with four equal masses,
where the solid lines denote the equilateral triangle shape and the dashed lines the isosceles
triangle shape. The blue lines (both solid and dashed-dotted) represent the two cases with
a mass ratio of m = 0.7. The solid red lines describe the unique solution when m = mo.

3.3 Bifurcations in different spaces
3.3.1 Bifurcations in the reduced subspace

In this section, we first discuss the bifurcation with the symmetric condition in our set-
tings. We wonder about the possible bifurcations of the reduced equations (10b) and
(10c) with respect to r = (a,b) as the variable and m as the parameter, i.e.,

G(r,m) = (91,92) = 90.

Now we rewrite g, = 0 and go = 0 as g3 = m— hi(a,b) = 0 and gg = m — ho(a,b) = 0,

where
h (a b) b3/ a2 (a3 8)(va2 —1 Ve —1)?
_ 40°(68 + (Ve —1—- VPI)
foley EEE 8)(vP=1— va? 1)?

4b3(a3 + (Ve? — 1 — Va? — 1)3)

We turn to consider the equation
G(r,m) = (93, ga) = 0.

Figure 3.5: Some examples of the concave kite central configurations with two pairs of equal masses. The
left and right figures show the positions of masses m3 and ma, respectively. In the left figure, different
colors represent different mass values for m3, and the dashed line and the solid line with the same color
denote the two distinct solutions, respectively. The right figure uses the same color and line scheme to
denote the corresponding positions of m4 for each mass value. For example, the red lines correspond to
the unique solution where m = mo. The black dashed and solid lines denote the two distinct solutions
for the equal mass case, respectively.

Noticing that * = (2/V3,2) is a singularity, or a discontinuity point of gq, ie., the two
iterated limits at 7 are m and m — 1/(2V3) respectively. This implies 7 is not a solution
for G =0. We say the equations G = 0 and G = 0 are equivalent on D = D\{7}. Hence,
the bifurcations of the two equations are the same. The Jacobian of G(r, m) with respect

Then the determinant of Jg is det Jg = fo. To find all the possible bifurcation points, we
consider the equation

We denote by

A(r) = (f2,9) =0. (20
Firstly, we claim that the unique solution of the equation (18), i.e., ro = (do, bo) € D
in (19) is also a solution for (20). In fact, from F'(ro, mo) = 0, we have

&

dhy

since h,(a,b) is just the expression of m in (11), satisfying hy(a,b(a)) = m(a). This

implies

dhy

qa }t=a0

15
since from (13) and (14) we have hy = w, - y/x1 = —w- x/y) = ha. Hence

Or Og Oh

Oa_ __ Oa _ Oa

holds for r = ro, which leads to det Je(ro) = fe(ro) = 0.

Secondly, we apply the interval arithmetic program to (20) to find zeros on the domain
D. We point out that to avoid the singularity during the calculation, we need to remove
the denominator of f2. In other words, we use

A(r) = (f2,9) = 0 (21)
in the program on the closed interval D to instead, where fy is the numerator of fy. After
excluding most of the interval pieces on D, we lock on a small piece near each zero. In
the same way, we split each small interval into smaller enough pieces, with the long side
of each rectangle no more than 107*. Finally, we get the only two solutions for (21), and
they are exactly ro and 7. One can see Figure 3.6 for illustration. One of the solutions,
namely, 7, can be excluded directly, since it is not a solution for G = 0. Therefore, ro is
the only zero for (20).

Figure 3.6: The curves of f2(a,b) = 0 and g(a,b) = 0 on the (a,b)-plane with a € [1.15, 1.18]. The only
two intersections are ro = (ao, bo) and 7 = (2/3, 2).

With Theorem 3 in Section 2.2, we do the computations with interval arithmetic to
determine the bifurcation type of ro. The eigenvectors of the eigenvalue 0 corresponding

to Jqg and JE can be chosen as
v = [-he, jul’ and w = [—jo1, ju)”

respectively, since Jcv = 0 and J@w = 0. The partial derivatives of G(r,m) with respect
to m is Gm = [1,1]”. Substituting the value of (r9, mo) into Jg we have

Falregttie = 4.5172058916474534136160228? —2.3231832749879904304948019?

Then, by direct computation, we obtain

16
This implies that (ro,™mo) is a bifurcation point of a fold type. When we perturb from
the two equal mass points €; and € in Figure 3.7 by increasing m from 1, two symmetric
central configurations may coalesce into one. This solution cannot be continued further
since there is no such symmetric central configuration when m > mo according to Theorem

The bifurcation occurs at F when m reaches mo. It is the only bifurcation point of the equation G = 0.

It is a fold type.

Figure 3.8: We always set m, = mz = 1, m3 = m4 =m and q, = (1,0), qo = (1,0). This figure shows
the bifurcations of the concave 4-body central configurations with two pairs of equal masses, including
both symmetric and asymmetric cases with respect to the y-axis. With m increasing from 0 to +00, two
bifurcation points are identified: at P; when m = m.,, asymmetric configurations emerge, while at F
when m = mo, symmetric configurations cease to exist.

3.3.2 Bifurcations in the whole planar 4-body configuration space

The bifurcations of the concave central configurations with two pairs of equal masses in the
whole planar 4-body configuration space have already been studied in [33]. The limiting

17
cases, namely, when one pair goes to 0 or +00, have already been discussed in [10]. To
better characterize the bifurcations, we fix the symmetry axis along the y-axis and set
my, = m2 = 1, m3 = my = mM, and q = (—1,0), gq = (1,0). This framework provides a
clear and complete picture of the bifurcations for both symmetric and asymmetric cases,
as shown in Figure 3.8 and Table 3.1. We need to point out in advance that the equal mass
cases E9,€3 and €, share the same convex hull, i.e., an isosceles triangle, but €3 and €, are
not symmetric with respect to the fixed symmetry axis under our previous settings. That
is the reason we put them in the asymmetric part. With m increasing from 0 to +00, two
bifurcation points are identified: at P, when m = mh, * 0.992299447752385347449845,
asymmetric configurations emerge, while at F when m = mo, symmetric configurations
cease to exist. These two bifurcation points have been found in [33]. The limiting cases,
including A; and Ay when m = 0, as well as H3 and H4 when m = ov, or equivalently
m3 = m4 = 1 and m; = m2 = 0, have been found in [10].

Remark 2. The above analysis reveals that a degenerate critical point (such as P, in Fig-
ure 3.8) may become non-degenerate within a reduced subspace, causing the bifurcation
to disappear when symmetry is taken into account. In contrast, the point F continues to
act as a bifurcation point in this specific subspace.
