Pauli exchange-repulsion is the dominant short-range intermolecular interaction and it is an es-
sential component of molecular force fields. Current approaches to modeling Pauli repulsion in
molecular force fields often rely on over 20 atom types to achieve chemical accuracy. The number
of parameters in these approaches hampers the development of force fields with quantum-chemical
accuracy that are transferable across many chemical systems. We present the anisotropic valence
density overlap (AVDO) model for exchange-repulsion. The model produces sub-kcal/mol accuracy
for dimers of organic molecules from the $101x7 dataset, a representative set of the most common
biologically relevant intermolecular interactions, and for acene dimers of increasing size. It uses
a single universal parameter, related to an atomic cross-sectional area, that is transferable across
chemical systems. Given recent progress in machine learning the electronic density, this model offers
a promising path toward high-accuracy, next-generation machine-learned force fields.

Classical force fields (FFs) of organic molecules have
een indispensable in molecular biology, drug design,
crystal structure prediction, and many other fields [1, 2].
n order to make FFs more accurate, better models for
intermolecular interactions such as Pauli repulsion, elec-
rostatics, induction, and dispersion are being explored
2-4]. This has led to an increase in the number of model
arameters [5, 6] such that overfitting becomes a chal-
lenge that can limit the transferability of these models
eyond the conformations and systems represented in the
raining data set. FFs fit solely on total energies or bulk
roperties are particularly ceptible, as the fitted pa-
rameters often adopt unphysical values that rely on error
cancellations with limited transferability.

One strategy for improving the transferability of FFs
is to fit individual FF terms to the corresponding compo-
nents of symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT)
[6-9], a method that calculates dimer interaction ener-
gies as the sum of exchange-repulsion, electrostatic, in-
duction, and dispersion interactions [4, 10]. Although
most SAPT variants are not applicable to predict macro-
scopic properties, studies have demonstrated that model
parameters fitted on SAPT can be used as Bayesian pri-
ors in a subsequent global fit to higher-level reference
data [9, 11, 12]. Thus, we adopt the perspective of eval-
uating a component of an FF by how well it reproduces
its corresponding SAPT component.

SAPT analysis indicates that Pauli repulsion is no
only a critical component of an FF [4], but also the larges
source of error in modern FFs [6, 8, 9, 11]. Hence, there
has been a renewed interest in approximating it accu-
rately (13, 14]. In benchmark dimer datasets exchange-
repulsion is often the single largest energy component and
has the largest variance [6, 15-17]. Macroscopic proper-
ies of condensed molecular systems, such as the density,
are determined by the balance between Pauli repulsion
and attractive intermolecular interactions. It is also a
key factor in determining the stacking conformation o:
m — interactions in proteins [18] and the preference o:
inear conformations of halogen sigma bonds [19], which

are prevalent in drug design because they increase drug
specificity [20]. Additionally, developing more accurate
exchange-repulsion models is also relevant for machine-
learned force fields [21], which often incorporate short-
range exchange-repulsion models [9, 22, 23], and may
benefit from more transferable and accurate models of
exchange repulsion.

Approximating Pauli repulsion in an accurate and
transferable way is a longstanding challenge [4, 13]. The
most common Pauli repulsion models used in FFs are
simple Lennard-Jones models [24] and Born-Mayer mod-
els, which use an exponential term for each atom [25, 26].
The fact that these models are isotropic, whereas an
atom centered model of exchange repulsion should be
anisotropic [4, 13, 27-33], and the fact that these models
have the wrong distance dependence [8] means that they
must be fit per molecule and often rely on error cancela-
tion with other terms in the FF to achieve accuracy [8].

The density overlap model [34, 35], an empirical model,
calculates the exchange-repulsion energy between two
molecules as

Eexch = K / papa ®r, (1)

where K is a fitted parameter and py and pz are the den-
sities of molecules A and B. It captures the anisotropy
of the exchange-repulsion energy [13, 28-31, 36, 37] and
has a better description of the distance dependence than
Lennard-Jones and Born-Mayer models [8]. However, like
the Lennard-Jones and Born-Mayer models, it is chal-
lenging to find transferable parameters for density over-
lap models. There is no single universal A’ parameter
that works for all molecules [38, 39] and instead K must
be fit per dimer pair to reach sub-kcal/mol accuracy for
small molecules, [11, 31, 40, 41], with values varying by
20-30% [31, 35, 40, 42, 43]. The density can be separated
into atom-centered partial densities [44, 45] so that differ-
ent atom type parameters (typically 20-30 atom types)
can be used with simple combination rules [8, 13, 46].
However, the fact that the parameter for a single element

can vary by as much as a factor of 2 suggests that trans-
ferability is limited to similar molecules, or even that
every molecule must be fit individually [8, 14]. The large
number of parameters in these density overlap models
hinders their transferability and the ability to fit them
on high-accuracy ab initio methods.

In this Letter, we show that removing the density from
core/semicore molecular orbitals reduces the variation in
he K parameter of the density overlap model. This
enables us to use a model with a single universal pa-
rameter to achieve sub-kcal/mol accuracy on a bench-
mark dataset of small organic molecules. We then show
hat the model extends to elements and atom types not
resent in the training dataset and to larger acene dimers.

Here v4 and vg are the electrostatic potentials gener-
ated by molecules A and B. Given that molecular or-
itals decay as ~ e~2V2" [53, 54], where € is the eigen-
value of the orbital, the top-most valence orbitals of both
molecules will contribute the most to S$,» and therefore to
Pa, Ps, and pp. Similarly, these orbitals also contribute
he most to the density overlap. This raises the ques-
ion of whether the low-energy molecular orbitals can be
neglected in density overlap models. It has been noted
hat removing core electrons does not significantly change
he exchange-repulsion potential energy surface (PES)
for water [37] and recent models implicitly neglect core
electrons [8, 11, 13].

Therefore, we investigate density overlap models that
use partial densities that systematically exclude contribu-
ions from low-energy orbitals. One spin-channel partial

To motivate this approximation, we first introduce the
change in the electron density of two molecules, A and
B, in close proximity due to the antisymmetrization of
their individual wavefunctions, V4 and Vp, without re-
laxation [47-49]:

Ap(r) = (Ua¥p| p(r)A|Va¥p) — (Vaal A(r) |Vas)

Here Einstein notation is used and a and b are indices
for all the molecular orbitals, ~, of the corresponding
molecule. A is the antisymmetrizer, which is then ap-
proximated by keeping only the permutations of one elec-
tron from molecule A and one electron from molecule B,
resulting in Ap containing terms only up to 2. pp is
the depletion in the electron density in the overlap region
induced by antisymmetrization. Electrons move from the
depletion region onto molecule A or B and cause a sur-
plus electron density 64 and pp, see Fig. 1.

Using f4, Pp, and pp, we express the first-order SAPT

where Nx is the number atoms of element X in the
molecule; and mx are the number of molecular orbitals
to neglect per atom of element X (see Table I for more de-
tails). This heuristic method removes low-energy molec-
ular orbitals associated with the 1s and 2s orbitals of
second row p-block elements.

* valence density

For each of these partial densities, we compute den-
sity overlaps analytically using the two monomer densi-
ties calculated using DFT with the PBE functional. We
then fit the K parameter of the density overlap model
by minimizing the mean absolute error with respect to
reference exchange-repulsion energies, which we compute
using SAPT(DFT)|[55, 56] with the PBE functional. See
Appendix A for more details.

First, we illustrate the general behavior of partial den-
sity overlap models by examining F2 and uracil homod-
imers. We fit K separately for each dimer and partial
density. For each fit, we use two dimer configurations
sampled at several intermolecular distances. The results
are presented in Fig. 2.

We observe that the exchange-repulsion PES changes
only slightly for density overlap models using different
artial densities. The mean relative difference between
he all-electron model and the valence model is 6%. How-
ever, removing the contribution of the low-energy orbitals
o the density overlap lowers the total overlap by 30%
for the valence model, as demonstrated by the commen-
surate increase in the value of K for the valence model.
Since the distance dependence of the density overlap be-
ween the low-energy molecular orbitals of one molecule
and the highest occupied orbitals of the other (the largest
art of the overlap that is neglected) is similar to the dis-
ance dependence of the valence density overlap, a con-
stant prefactor can effectively account for the missing
contributions within this restricted distance regime. Im-
ortantly, while the PES remains largely unaltered, we
observe that the difference between the fitted K param-
eters of the two dimers decreases by using the valence
density. This illustrates the possibility that using a par-
ial density can increase the transferability of the density
overlap model.
Second, we test the accuracy of partial density overlap
models that use a single universal K parameter. Each

bon dimers in $101x7, form a test set used to evaluate
whether the model is transferable to new molecules. We
neglect the configurations which have a distance of 0.7

dimers as these configurations have interaction energies
that are 30 kcal/mol above the minima and are thus not
accessible at room temperature.

The results are presented in Table II and Fig. 3. We
see that the models which remove the core electrons, the
2s electrons of oxygen, or the 2s electrons of oxygen and

led at 7 intermolecular distances along a dissociation
curve. For the fitting procedure, we use the S66 subset

interactions in biomolecules. The remaining five neutral

and oxygen, together with the five fluorinated hydrocar-

curate as the all-electron model and has a relative RMSE
of 7% for equilibrium geometries with respect to the stan-
dard deviation of the SAPT(DFT) reference. When ap-

plied to the test set, we see that the model maintains its
accuracy, with a relative RMSE of 9%. This central result
demonstrates that AVDO is not only accurate, but also
transferable to molecules containing atom types, such as
fluorine, that are not included in the training data set.

SAPT Exchange-Repulsion Energy

FIG. 3. Exchange repulsion energies (kcal/mol) on the train-
ing/test dataset for models using one universal K parameter
with either the all electron density or the valence density.

Further analyzing the results, we see in Table II that
he error for all the density overlap models increases as
he intermolecular distance decreases. Although density
overlap models have the same exponential dependence as
he exchange repulsion energy, they have the wrong poly-
nomial prefactor [13, 53] and thus will not be accurate on
he entire domain of intermolecular distances (see the SM
for tests using Boltzmann weighting in the fitting proce-
dure to compensate for this). As to whether certain types
of molecules give larger errors, we note that dimers with
‘wo hydrogen bonds have large relative errors and have
he largest absolute errors. The dimers with two hydro-
gen bonds have smaller intermolecular distances than the
other dimers and thus have large errors due to the afore-
mentioned distance dependence error of density overlap
models. In particular, the acetic acid dimer has a relative
RMSE of 12% when the intermolecular distance is 0.8Req
(this is the point that is farthest to the upper right corner
in Fig. 3). The relative RMSE for this dimer decreases
10 2% at Reg.

To put these results in the context of other exchange-
repulsion models, the overlap repulsion model in the
AMOEBA force field [13, 14] yields an RMSE of 0.4
kcal/mol for equilibrium configurations of the full s101x7
dataset using 26 atom types, for a total of 78 fitted pa-
rameters. The isotropic Slater-ISA density overlap model
8] used a dataset of smaller organic molecules than the
ones in the $101x7 dataset and has an RMSE of 0.2
kcal/mol in the attractive region using 36 atom type

arameters. Thus, our model drastically reduces the
number of fitted parameters and is transferable to new
molecules at the cost of being slightly less accurate near
equilibrium and about 1 kcal/mol worse for highly repul-
sive configurations [59].

Finally, we check the accuracy of AVDO as a func-

tion of system size by computing the exchange repulsion
for acene homodimers using the experimental nearest-
neighbor configuration taken from the most stable molec-
ular crystal polymorph [60, 61] (the herring-bone config-
uration, see the SM ). As seen in Table IT, the accuracy
of the AVDO model does not degrade with system size,
despite the pi-pi conjugation present in these molecules.
We also note that the performance is significantly better
chan the all-electron model.
Having shown that the AVDO model is transferable
across a broad range of organic molecules, we now discuss
she reason for this transferability. As shown in the SM,
che distribution of optimal K parameters for each dimer
is narrower for the AVDO model than for the all-electron
model. A simple explanation for the transferability is
hat removing low-energy orbitals based on the elements
in the molecule acts as an implicit atom type which mod-
ifies the overlap density for each pair of atoms. However,
his simple explanation does not explain why the number
of orbitals removed for each atom type matches chemi-
cal intuition. To gain more insight about errors in the
density overlap model, we first consider noble gas homod-
imers starting from the orbital overlap model [13, 48],

Leach = — “I Va be),

where rp is the interatomic distance and Ko is a unitless
parameter that is nearly equal to one [48]. This approxi-
mation is motivated by the form of the SAPT exchange-
repulsion energy, Eq. 4. Using the mean-geometric in-
equality (assuming that the wavefunctions are real),

([ teva’ ry < v [vi upd (5)

where V is the volume of the integral, we find that

The more orbital pairs with zero overlap due to nodes in
the wavefunction, the more the density overlap overesti-
mates the orbital overlap approximation [39, 62]. Since
heavier atoms have more orbitals, the density overlap
will overestimate the orbital overlap approximation more.
For this reason, we speculate that removing the overlaps
of the core orbitals lowers the density overlap in a way
that systematically cancels with this overestimation.

Eq. 6 also provides an explanation for the magnitude
of the value of the K parameter, which is 32.4 Bohr?
for the all-electron density overlap model. We approx-
imate the volume V as a cylinder between two atoms
with a radius defined by the atom’s van der Waals ra-
dius, V = mr2qyrap. Since K © K2V/rap and Ky © 1,
K is approximately the cross-sectional area of an atom.
Using a van der Waals radius of 2.8 Bohr yields K = 25
Bohr?. This explanation can be extended to molecules
by starting with localized Boys orbitals [63] rather than

on

the same as Eq. 6, where V can still be approximated as

the overlap region between the two molecules.

As to the computational expense and possible appli-
cations of the AVDO model, in principle, the AVDO
model provides the exchange-repulsion PES at the cost
of a single DFT calculation for the electron density for
each monomer, though here a DFT calculation is done
for every configuration because we use dimer basis sets
(see the SM for results of similar accuracy using lighter,
monomer basis sets). Recently, machine learning meth-
ods have been developed that can predict the electron
density [64-67], with state-of-the-art models achieving
an integrated absolute error in the density of 0.002 per
an electron on molecules from the QM9 dataset [68, 69
which were not present in the training dataset [69-72]. In
a future publication, we will show that the AVDO mode
can take advantage of these recent developments so that
no DFT calculation is needed. An added benefit of using
a machine-learned model is that it can represent the den-
sity using a density-fitting basis [64, 66, 70, 72-74] and
this enables the efficient calculation of the density over-
lap. We estimate that with a density-fit basis, the AVDO
model would be on par with the cost of machine-learned
potentials (about 3 orders of magnitude slower than a
Born-Mayer model). Given this cost, we think that this
model will be useful for molecular docking, geometry op-
timization, and the generation of datasets for machine-
learning. As to whether this model can be fit on higher
accuracy reference methods, we find that the parameter
XX is relatively insensitive to changes in the density tail

due to different levels of theory (see Fig. 3 in the SM). It
is also known that MP2 exchange-repulsion energies are
proportional to Hartree-Fock exchange-repulsion energies
[75] and, additionally, it has been shown that CCSD den-
sities can be predicted by machine-learned models [74].
This indicates that the model has the potential to be
used/fitted on higher accuracy ab-initio methods.

In conclusion, we show that using the valence den-
sity instead of the all-electron density enables us to cre-
ate a model for Pauli exchange-repulsion using a single
universal fitted parameter: the anisotropic valence den-
sity overlap (AVDO) model. The AVDO model achieves
sub-kcal/mol accuracy for near equilibrium dimers, even
for molecules containing “atom types” that are absent
from its training dataset and evidence suggests that the
AVDO model is applicable to larger molecules as well.
These advantages come at the cost of being more ex-
pensive than simpler models of exchange-repulsion. The
AVDO model provides insight into how to improve the
transferability of these other models and, more impor-
antly, the model can be integrated in a machine-learned
(ML) force field framework, where the additional cost is
relatively moderate and is far outweighed by the bene-
fit of having a model with excellent transferability. In-
‘egrating the AVDO model with an ML model for the
density would make the AVDO model fully predictive.
This approach has the advantage that it replaces ma-
chine learning dimer interaction energies with monomer
densities, resulting in a significant reduction in the size of
he dataset needed. This work brings us one step closer
o transferable, high-accuracy force fields for biological
applications such as drug discovery and for generating
high-accuracy, synthetic data for ML force fields.

ANTISYMMETRIZATION INDUCED REDISTRIBUTION OF THE DENSITY

In Fig. 1 we show the redistribution of the density due to antisymmetrization. fp, and fg have an S-orbital
character for the He and Hz dimer, but have a predominantly P-orbital character for the Ne and F2 dimers, as seen
by the nodes in the density. This is what prompted our investigation into neglecting semicore states. As an aside, we
also tried using fractional occupations of orbitals in defining the partial densities, but doing so can break molecular
orbital symmetries and produced significantly worse results.

the positions of the atoms. Solid lines indicate positive values and dotted lines indicate negative values.

DISTRIBUTION OF OPTIMAL kK PARAMETERS FOR EACH DIMER

We fit AK for each dimer pair individually from the training dataset and plot the spread of optimal K values, see
Fig. 2a. The standard deviation for K for the all-electron model is 3.5 Bohr?, which is 11% of the value of K, while
the standard deviation for the valence model is 2.4 Bohr?, which is 6% of the value of K. This demonstrates how
removing low-energy orbitals from the density improves the transferability of the K parameter.

In Fig. 2be we investigate if molecules with different elements have different K values. We show that there is a
slight difference in K values for molecules that contain oxygen and nitrogen for the all-electron model that is removed
in the valence model and that hydrocarbons such as pentane, cyclopentane, etc. have K values that are distinct in
both groups, but closer to the other dimer A’ values for the valence model. The ethyne-ethyne dimer is the outlier
with the largest K value for both the all electron and valence model, and dimers containing ethyne have the largest
K values in general. Ref. [1] removed all the dimers with ethyne when constructing the new Pauli repulsion model
for AMOEBA. We keep the dimers with ethyne in the dataset because the valence model performs reasonably well
on the other dimers with ethyne.

BOLTZMAN WEIGHTING

It is expected that density overlap models will not be able to cover the entire range of distances accurately because
even though the overlap density has the same exponential dependence as the exchange repulsion energy it has the
wrong polynomial prefactor [1, 2]. Here, we investigate how much equilibrium configurations can be improved by
using Boltzmann weighting, i.e. we minimize the sum of the absolute errors of each calculation weighted by

w; = e(- Bi Emin)/RE

where E; is the CCSD(T) energy of configuration i, Ey, is the CCSD(T) energy of the equilibrium distance for
that configuration, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T = 300K. Note that this is not exactly Boltzmann weighting
because each configuration uses it’s own minimum as the reference, but doing this ensures that all dimer configurations
are treated equally. The results are shown in Table I. Boltzmann weighting reduces the mean error for both the all-
electron and valence models, however the error due to using a single universal K keeps the RMSE at equilibrium
distances from decreasing significantly. Thus, one can tradeoff between having slightly better accuracy at equilibrium
at the expense of worse errors for the repulsive wall. The K for the valence model using Boltzmann weighting is 42.7
Bohr?.

FITTING DIFFERENT REFERENCE METHODS

Here we investigate whether the results of the valence overlap method hold for other reference methods. The density
overlap strongly depends on the tails of the density. Since the density decays as e72V2T [3] and approximate DFT
functionals give a large spread in I [4], the density overlap will change when using different reference methods. There
are ways to correct DFT to get correct ionization potentials and thus have a better decay of the density such as using
optimally tuned range-separated hybrids [4] or the GRAC correction [5]. However, in order to test if our results are
accurate for a broad range of functionals we calculate the density overlap model for PBEO and Hartree-Fock and fit
it to the corresponding SAPTO exchange repulsion energies based on these methods. We present these results in Fig.

also changes commensurately, such that the valence model remains accurate and the fitted AK parameter changes by
a modest 5% between methods. These results suggest that the transferability results presented above for the valence
method are applicable when using other reference methods and densities.

configurations shown in Fig. 2 of the main text). The valence density is used for each case. The exchange-repulsion potential
energy surface can vary significantly between methods, while the fitted parameter K experiences a modest change

USING A SMALL MONOMER BASIS SET FOR THE DENSITY

The density overlap for dimers farther apart than their equilibrium distances is highly dependent on the tails of
the density. In Table II we quantify the effect of the basis set convergence on density overlap models by comparing
models using the converged aug-ccpVTZ dimer basis set to calculate the density overlap and models that use a
small aug-ccpVDZ monomer basis set. Each model is fit to reproduce the same S66 training dataset computed with
SAPT(DFT) on an aug-ccpVDZ dimer basis set. We see a small, but notable, increase in error for the equilibrium
and the medium-range dimers by using these under converged densities. The K parameter only slightly changes, due

to needing to fit dimers at all the distances present in the dataset. This shows that the model is not very sensitive to
the basis set, though performance does improve with larger basis sets.
