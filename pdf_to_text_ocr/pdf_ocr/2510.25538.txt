ABSTRACT

Context. Filamentary accretion-flows as gas-funneling mechanisms are a key aspect in high-mass star formation research. The kine-

matic properties along these structures are of particular intere:
Aims. The scope of this paper is focused on the question if ga

transported to dense clumps inside high-mass star-forming regions

through filamentary structures on a scale of several parsecs to the sub-parsec scale.

Methods. We quantify the gas flows from a scale of up to several parsecs down to the sub-parsec scale along filamentary struc-
tures. In this work the accretion flow mechanisms based on gas kinematic data in the three high-mass star-forming regions G75.78,
IRAS21078+5211 and NGC7538 are studied with data obtained from the IRAM 30 m telescope. The analysis is carried out using the
surface density derived from 1.2 mm continuum emission and velocity differences estimated from HCO* (1 — 0) and H'°CO* (1 — 0)

molecular line data.

Results. The mass flow-behavior of the gas in the vicinity of high-mass star-forming clumps shows characteristic dynamical patterns,
such as an increased mass flow rate towards the clumps. We assume the velocity differences to originate from filamentary-gas infall
onto the high-mass star-forming clumps; the inclination of the filament-structures along the line of sight is however unknown. Nev-

ertheless, using the velocity differences and mass surface densities,
with respect to the line of sight and towards clumps. We quantify the flow rates towards the clumps in a range from about 1073 Mo yr

we can estimate mean flow rates along the filamentary structures
-1

to 10° Mg yr“, inferred from clump-centered polar plots. Slight variations of the flow rates along the filamentary structures may be

caused by overdensities and velocity gradients along the filaments.

Conclusions. While the initial studies presented here already reveal interesting results such as an increasing mass flow rate towards
clumps, the properties of filamentary gas flows from large to small spatial scales, as well as potential variations over the evolutionary

sequence, are subject to future studies.

1. Introduction

Understanding filamentary accretion-flows as a central mecha-
nism in high-mass star formation is still an open field of re-
search with many aspects yet unknown (e.g. Hacar et al. 2023,
Pineda et al. 2023). Theory provides us with models of cloud-
collapse, fragmentation and other processes that lead to fila-
mentary accretion-flows in giant molecular clouds (GMC) and
molecular clouds (MC) (e.g. Smith et al. 2012, Smith et al.
2014, Smith et al. 2016, Vazquez-Semadeni et al. 2019, Padoan
et al. 2020, Zhao et al. 2024). The difference between GMCs
and MCs is their mass: GMCs are larger and much more mas-
sive, exceeding 10° Mo. In this study, we focus on parsec-scale
accretion-flows from the cloud environment onto the dense high-
mass clumps prone to massive cluster formation.

The three star-forming regions studied in this paper are
G75.78 with the main clump G75.78+0.34 (hereafter G75),

IRAS21078+5211 (hereafter IRAS21078) and NGC7538, con-
sisting of NGC7538 IRS1, NGC7538 S and NGC7538 IRS9.
The sources are part of the CORE program (Beuther et al. 2018,
Beuther et al. 2020, Gieser et al. 2021, Ahmadi et al. 2023,
Beuther et al. 2024). We summarize their main parameters in Ta-
ble 1. According to their estimated masses and equivalent radii
of about 1 pc, we refer to them as clumps throughout this work.
They have been subject to studies in the past; young stellar ob-
jects (YSOs) and Hil-regions have been observed in all regions
(see e.g. Riffel & Liidke 2014, Moscadelli et al. 2021, Beuther
et al. 2022). While the initial aim was to include all CORE-
regions into this survey, we only obtained data for three of them
due to weather conditions during the observing window. All re-
gions would have represented a broader range of mass regimes;
this is why IRAS21078 is included in this work despite its lower
mass compared to the other two sources.

Fig. 1. Top row: NIKA2 1.2mm dust continuum maps (see Beuther et al. 2024) of the star-forming regions showing the clump and filament
designations. The red and magenta markers indicate the data points used for the flow rate estimation in Section 3.2. Triangular magenta markers
indicate a separate section along a structure. Black contours outline the 1.2 mm continuum, ranging from 3a to 39o in steps of 3a (the RMS-
values are presented in Table 5). The red contours in the upper panels mark the peak-positions of the continuum emission from 20% to 100% in
steps of 20%. Designations used in the following refer to clumps and filament-structures, filaments are marked by an “F” in the designation; “CF”
in G75 stands for “central filament’, “CC” in IRAS21078 refers to “central clump” while the clumps in NGC7538 are the known objects IRS9,
IRS and S (e.g. Beuther et al. 2020). G75 S1 is the object G75.78+0.34. We present the clump-designations together with their coordinates in
Table 3. Bottom row: The same dust-maps with red contour lines outlining the Hil-regions at 1.4 GHz (21 cm) (Condon et al. 1998); the contours
range from 10% to 100% of the peak emission in steps of 10% (see Table 5 for reference). The positions of the two main exciting sources of the
Hil-region in NGC7538, NGC7538 IRS5 and NGC7538 IRS6, are marked in the lower right panel (Puga et al. 2010).

Filament-structures and hubs have been studied in other star-
forming regions in the past, and velocity gradients along fila-
ments have been identified (e.g. Peretto et al. 2013, Peretto et al.
2014, Kim et al. 2022, Ma et al. 2023). Whether observed ve-
locity differences traced by molecules are signatures from flows
inside filament-structures however is still not entirely clear. In
this work we will investigate such structures in all three regions
in detail and apply a simple mass flow estimation model. The
mass flow approach to quantify accretion-flows in high-mass
star-forming regions has already been outlined and used in pre-
vious studies (e.g. Beuther et al. 2020, Wells et al. 2024). On
the theoretical side, processes from large to small scales have

been, for example, modeled and categorized into inertial in-
fall and subsequent inflow, followed by accretion onto prestellar
clumps (e.g. Smith et al. 2012, Smith et al. 2014, Smith et al.
2016, Padoan et al. 2020, Zhao et al. 2024). On the other hand,
the formation of filamentary structures inside GMCs and MCs
is assumed to be a direct consequence of enhanced anisotropy
during cloud collapse and fragmentation, after which the fila-
ments act as channels were gas is funneled onto the prestel-
lar clumps (e.g. Vazquez-Semadeni et al. 2019, Padoan et al.
2020). Most simulations show also that the formation of fila-
ments is a consequence of crossing shocks (Vazquez-Semadeni
et al. 2003, Mac Low & Klessen 2004, Krumholz et al. 2005,

Hennebelle & Chabrier 2011, Padoan & Nordlund 2011, Feder-
rath & Klessen 2012, Pudritz & Kevlahan 2013). The analysis of
the high-mass star-forming MCs in this work generally takes into
account scales of several parsecs down to the sub-parsec scale.

The structure of the paper is as follows: We will start by in-
troducing the data in Sect. 2, also giving a brief overview of the
reduction process and archival data. We then focus on the mass
flow-analysis in Sect. 3. We conclude this analysis with a sum-
mary and outlook in Section 4.

2. Observation

We present the NIKA2 1.2 mm dust continuum emission maps
for all three sources in Fig. 1. The first moment maps (intensity

marize the RMS-values for the molecular data in Table 4. Data
reduction and analysis have been conducted using the GILDAS!
framework with the subprograms CLASS and GREG.

2.1. IRAM 30m EMIR observation

We use three different sets of data in this analysis: The IRAM
30m spectral line data were observed in 2021 (project-id 121-
20) as part of the CORE program (Beuther et al. 2018) with
a beam size of 27” in the 3mm band. The raw data was cali-
brated to the main-beam temperature T;,, with a beam efficiency
of 76%. The spectral resolution is 0.9km s~!. We identified

band as the J=1-0 transition, with a E,,/k-value of 4.3 K and the
HCO* emission as J=1-0 at 86.754 GHz with E,/k = 4.2K.
We list the molecular properties in Table 2. The moment maps
were produced with a lower intensity threshold of 4a (cf. Table
4). Because we noted some absorption features in the optically
thick HCO* compared to the optically thin H'CO* (Fig. 5), we
also included the latter molecular data into the analysis (Fig. 3).

We derived dust temperature maps by applying the itera-
tive spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting procedure outlined
by Lin et al. (2016), using both Herschel data and the NIKA2
1.2mm maps. Prior to SED fitting, the NIKA2 1.2mm map
was corrected for missing large-scale flux and free-free emis-
sion. Large-scale structures were recovered by combining the
NIKA2 map with Herschel data in the Fourier domain using
the J-comb algorithm (Jiao et al. 2022). The combined map was
then convolved to 27” to match the angular resolution of the
free—free emission map, which is derived based on H41a obser-
vations (for a detailed explanation, see Gieser et al. 2023, Sec-
tion 4.2). Finally, the free—free corrected NIKA2 1.2mm map
was obtained by subtracting the free—free contribution from the
combined map. Single-component modified blackbody fits were
performed pixel by pixel after convolving all maps to a common
beam size and regridding to the same pixel scale. In the iterative
fitting process (Lin et al. 2016), the final dust temperature maps
were obtained at 27” resolution.

2.2. Archival continuum data

We use 1.4GHz Very Large Array (VLA) data and tempera-
ture data from the Herschel infrared Galactic Plane Survey (Hi-
GAL; Molinari et al. 2016, Marsh et al. 2017) and the IRAM
30m NIKA2 1.2 mm dust continuum data (see e.g. Beuther et al.
2024, Sect. 2.1). The underlying dust continuum maps that we
use to identify filament-like structures originate from NIKA2
1.2mm continuum data from the CORE sample, observed with
the IRAM 30 m telescope (Beuther et al. 2024) with a beam size
of 12”.

Radio continuum-data to probe the Hll-regions were taken
from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) 1.4 GHz VLA survey
(see e.g. Condon et al. 1998), the peak and o;ms-values of both
the dust continuum-data and the Hil-data are presented in Table
Sn

3. Results

In Fig. 2 we show the intensity-weighted peak velocities (1st
moment) for HCO* (1 —0) in the three sources, while we present
the same for H!7CO* (1 —0) in Fig. 3. The lower threshold when
creating the maps was set to 3c. We note interesting patterns:
HCO* (1 — 0) and H'CO* (1 — 0) display strong velocity dif-
ferences of up to a few kms"! in the vicinity of N1 and promi-
nently between S1 and S2 in G75. We also note gradients next to
G75 CF and north of G75 S1. Inside IRAS21078, velocity dif-
ferences of about 1 kms~! cover the extent of the cloud, with a
sharp cutoff close to the eastern/south-eastern edge (except for
H'COt (1 — 0), which is spatially confined to the denser re-
gions of the source). In NGC7538, the velocity differences of
~1 kms"! can be seen around IRS1 and S (cf. Fig. 1). What else
besides gravitational infall could produce these velocity differ-
ences? Rotation of clumps appears an unlikely candidate since
rotation of clouds on parsec scales has not convincingly been
observed. The Hil-regions may impact the velocity structure,
and one sees that in the bar-like structure in the north-west of
NGC7538 (Fig. 2). In G75, the southern Hi-region is located ex-
actly in the middle of the clumps S1 and S2 (Fig. 1), it can hence
even increase the gas flow towards the clump. Similar scenar-
ios could happen in IRAS 21078. Hence, while the Hil-regions

may have some influence, in the framework of this analysis, we
assume that the velocity gradients are dominated by gas flows
towards the clumps.

We also note the lack of HCO*-data in the northern part
of NGC7538, but HCO* (1 — 0)-emission towards the peak of
the Hil-region (cf. Figs. 1, 2 and 3). The Hi-region is excited
by the two sources IRSS and IRS6 with spectral types of O9
and O3 respectively (Puga et al. 2010) and already has photo-
dissociated the molecular gas to a large extent (the other two
sources have HII-regions as well, but no lack of molecular emis-
sion from the HCO* (1 — 0)-line). The strong and sharp velocity
differences of up to about 4 kms"! along the north-western fil-
amentary structure in NGC7538 are therefore likely expected to
stem from feedback from the Hil-region, and not from gas-infall.
This assertion is important for the later interpretation of mass
flow-behavior inside this source.

As shown in Figs. 5, C.5 and C.6, the main isotopologue
can be optically thick towards the main emission peaks and may
hence show multiple peaked spectra, whereas the rarer H!7CO*
spectra always have Gaussian profiles, typical of optically thin
lines. We do not estimate absolute optical depths because that is
not needed for our analysis. Since we are interested in the peak
velocities, we use the H'3CO* Ist moment maps to study the
velocity field. Where H'3CO* is not detected, the optical depth
of HCO* is probably low because it shows single Gaussian pro-
files. Therefore, at these positions the HCO* Ist moment maps
can represent the velocity structure well.

3.1. Methods: flow rate estimates

The estimation of the mass flow rate follows the approach used
in Beuther et al. 2020 and discussed in more detail by Wells
et al. 2024. The filamentary structures are identified in the dust
continuum emission and inclination i relative to the observer is
considered within the uncertainties discussed further below. We
can estimate a mass flow rate as

M(i) =%,- Av, fan Ar,, qd)

where &, is the beam-averaged mass surface density along the
filamentary structures, Av, is the velocity difference between a
point and the center of measurement (a high-mass star-forming
clump) and Ar, a projected distance along the structures and
points of measurement. The mass flow rate estimate is a function
of i, where tan(i) has to be non-vanishing; the subscript r indi-
cates the “real” values for the inclined filament-structure (for a
detailed derivation, see Wells et al. 2024). The surface density
can be estimated from the 1.2 mm dust continuum assuming op-
tically thin emission as (Hildebrand 1983, Schuller et al. 2009):

where F,, is the flux-density, R the gas-to-dust ratio (150, Draine
2011), B, the Planck function at the dust temperature Tp, kK,
the dust absorption coefficient, which was set to 0.9cm? g™! (as
given in Table 1 col. 5 in Ossenkopf & Henning 1994), yu the
mean molecular weight of the interstellar medium; assumed to
equal 2.8, my the mass of the hydrogen atom and Q. the solid
angle. We measure the flux-density F, from the 1.2mm dust
continuum at 250 GHz and consider the dust temperature ob-
tained for G75 and NGC7538 from the Hi-GAL Galactic Plane
Survey (Molinari et al. 2016) as mentioned in Sect. 2. As for
IRAS21078, the temperature values were set constant to charac-
teristic values of 20 K, which has to be considered within the er-
ror margins. We checked the impact of the constant temperature
with a comparison for G75 and NGC7538, where we averaged
over the mass flow rates for each section of measurement and
took the ratio of the variable temperature data and the constant
temperature data. We estimated an average increase of the mass
flow rate for the fixed values of about 75%. We note that the dif-
ference in temperature close to peak-emission near the clumps
is higher and therefore affects the overall mass flow rate to a
larger degree. The systematic errors for the measured quantities
in Eqs. (1) and (2) have been estimated. We assume a velocity
uncertainty of 0.5 km s~!, slightly larger than half the velocity
resolution. From the SED fitting, each data point was weighted
by its measured noise, yielding an average dust temperature un-
certainty of 1K. We furthermore estimated 5% uncertainty for
the flux-density (typical calibration uncertainty, see Perotto et al.
2020). Regarding the uncertainties of the projected distances to
the center, since these are always relative distances within the
maps, we assume an uncertainty of | pixel or 5’. All errors have
been estimated by applying Gaussian error propagation to Eqs.
(1) and (2).

3.2. Flows along filaments

For this part of the analysis we conducted the flux-density and
velocity difference measurements along filamentary structures
identified in the dust continuum maps. We plotted the mass flow
rate as a function of the distance along the structure (see Figs. 6,
7, 8). The mass flow rate was estimated with the separation Ar as
the half beam size of 13.5” from the kinematic data and the sur-
face density calculated from the flux-value taken at one marker-
position, whereas the velocity difference was always taken rela-
tive to the center of the starting point (a clump, see also Section
3.1). All velocity-values were taken preferably from H'3CO*
emission, and only from HCO* emission if the former was un-
detected at the respective position in the map (Fig. 1).

We chose the main connecting filament in G75 (CF) and
the northern and southern halves of the cloud. In IRAS21078,
we focused on the three structures that stretch away from the
central clump (CC) in north-eastern, north-western and south-
western direction respectively (Fig. 1). In NGC7538, we picked
the northern strip of the cloud, the eastern and the south-western
structures (Fig. 1). As outlined in the previous section, the data
do not directly yield information about the flow-direction. Fol-
lowing the picture of dynamical, filamentary clouds that collapse
and feed star-forming gas clumps (e.g. Myers 2009, Smith et al.
2014, Smith et al. 2016, Vazquez-Semadeni et al. 2019, Padoan
et al. 2020) we assume that the flow is always directed towards
the clumps. While outflows or expanding Hil-regions might in

some region invert the flow direction, for our analysis we as-
sume always that the flows are dominated by accretion flows to-
wards the clumps. Because of this assumption, measurements
along structures connecting two clumps were split, where the
velocity differences where taken relative to one clump for one
half, and relative to the other clump for the other half. This was
conducted for CF in G75 and along F-E between IRS9 and S
in NGC7538. In order to emphasize this separation, the relevant

parts are marked by triangular magenta markers, as seen in Fig.
1. We note that all marker-positions were identified by eye. The
same holds for the splitting of filaments.

In Fig. 6 we show the mass flow rates along the two halves
of the central filament (CF) structure in G75 (Fig. 1). We can see
a characteristic shape of the curve along the structure. While in
general the estimated flow rates in this filament decrease with in-
creasing distance to the clump, we note a “bump” at approximate
2.25 to 2.75 pe in the plot for the lower part. The same holds for
the mass flow rate plot eastwards of N2 in G75 (Fig. A.1), where
we also observe similar maxima. As for the southern part, the
flow rate values from S2 southwards show a comparable irregu-
lar behavior with increasing distance. As for N2 and S2, we note
nearby density-enhancements which stand out in the 1.2 mm dust
continuum (Fig. 1) and cause a large increase in surface density.

In Fig. 7, we present the estimated mass flow rate along the
largest filament structure in IRAS21078, which shows an overall
decline in magnitude with increasing distance from the central
clump. The mass flow rate does, however, show intriguing peaks
at about 0.7, 0.8 and 1.4 pe respectively. We also can see strong
depressions at about 0.6 pe and 1.4 pc in Fig. 7.

In Fig. 8 we present the same for the F-SW filament in
NGC7538 (cf. Fig. 1), with again declining and peaking mass
flow rate estimates along the structure with prominent depres-
sions at about 0.5 to 1.2 pc. All mentioned flow rate increases fall

onto the position of overdense sections or minor clumps along
filament-structures (in comparison of the flow rate graphs with
Fig. 1), but at the same time we also can observe velocity gra-
dients in the vicinity of these clumps (see Figs. 2 and 3). The
trend of an increasing mass flow rate towards the denser clump-
sections may therefore be partially associated with an increase
in surface density. These sharp maxima along the mass flow rate
curve are likely the result of steep velocity differences along the
filament.

The mass flow rate estimation along filamentary structures
was carried out for all three structures in IRAS21078 (Figs. 7
and A.2) and for the north-western, eastern and south-western
structures in NGC7538 (Figs. 8, A.4, A.3). Most of the mass
flow plots along filamentary structures show no clear decline in
mass flow rate with increasing distance.

To separate important factors contributing to the mass flow
rate, the mass surface density & and the velocity difference Av
have been plotted versus the distance in Figs. 9 and 10 to give a
clearer distinction and indicate the more dominant contributor to
M. We can see that the overall shape of the curve is dominated by
the surface density for the northern half of the filament and inter-
estingly by the velocity differences for the southern half. Sharp
features (i.e. maxima) along the curves stem from strong veloc-
ity differences. The possible cause for these velocity differences
and the different impact of the two factors in the top and bottom
part of G75 CF will be assessed in Sect. 4.

To be able to compare the correlation of velocity difference
and surface density and their impact onto the mass flow rate gen-
erally, we plotted the separated factors of Eq. (1) for all major
filament-structures that we analyzed in this sections and present
them in Appendix A. Many of the plots show spikes along the
curve that either are caused by locally confined overdensities
along filaments or steep variations of velocity differences. Most
of the curves show a decline in surface density with increasing
distance and spikes being caused by Av (see e.g. Figs. A.7, A.8,
A.9, A.10, A.11). In the case of the structure eastwards from
N2 in G75, the surface density shows two maxima for two local
overdensities (Fig. A.5 and Fig. | for reference) but the overall
mass flow rate only exhibits a maximum at about 1.7 pe and not

and 0.3kms™! at 0.7 pc compared to about 1 kms! at 1.7 pc).

As for NGC7538 F-E, the mass flow rate is described by the
velocity difference to a large degree (Fig. A.13), whereas a sharp
drop in surface density between 0.1 and 0.3 pe does not visibly
affect the course of the curve. In the case of the F-NW struc-
ture in NGC7538 (Fig. A.11) the Hi-region affects the velocity-
distribution of the molecular gas (e.g. Beuther et al. 2022) and
thus causing the spikes in the velocity differences, excluding this
graph for the accretion-analysis towards IRS1. The same holds
for G75 S2 (A.6), where the Hil-region is located nearby be-
tween S2 and SI (see Fig. 1 lower panels). A similar feature
appears in the graph for the velocity difference for IRAS21078
F-NE (Fig. A.7), where the sharp maximum at 0.4 pc is located
close to the center of the Hil-region (see Fig. | bottom panels).

3.3. Flows onto clumps

In order to characterize the gas flow onto the clumps from all
directions, the mass flow rates estimated with Eq. (1) are de-
picted in the form of polar plots for the central massive clumps
and star-forming regions to give an intuitive picture of the two-
dimensional spatial distribution of mass flow magnitudes. In ev-
ery polar diagram we included a red dot as an indicator for
the adjacent filament structure. These dots have been set by
eye. The velocity differences have been evaluated by taking the
value from one position around the center and subtract the given
velocity-value for the center of the clump, similar to our ap-
proach along filaments (Section 3.2). The distance Ar in Eq. (1)
was set to the half beam size of 13.5’ and the flux-values were
taken for the same data point as the velocity, in order to be con-
sistent with the previous flow rate-approach along the filaments.

In this way, the plots show mass flow rate-estimates al-
ways relative to the center, were 16 individual measurements
were conducted (one data point every 22.5 degrees). The ra-

dial distances for the measurements were chosen to 20 and 40
arcseconds, resulting in a maximum distance to one clump of
about 0.7 pe for G75, 0.52 pe for NGC7538 and 0.29 pe for
IRAS21078. Distances further out exhibit no significant surface
density from the dust and are therefore not usable for this polar
mass flow rate estimation (cf. Fig. 1).

For this study we investigated prominent clumps of star for-
mation hosted inside the three clouds. All clumps have been
identified by eye from the dust continuum maps. Their coordi-
nates are given in Table 3. These coordinates have been taken
from the marker positions towards the clumps (see Fig. 1), which
correspond to the peak positions of the dust continuum. for G75,
we chose two regions in the northern part of the cloud (N1 and
N2, see Fig. 1) and two in the southern part (S1 and S2, see Fig.
1). The two southern clumps are of particular interest, since there
is a Hil-region between them (see. Fig. 1). In IRAS21078, we
evaluated the mass flow-behavior at the central part of the cloud
(CC, see Fig. 1) and in NGC7538 for IRS1, S and IRS9 (see Fig.
1). The flow rate estimation around prominent clumps provides
further insight into the nature of mass accretion on sub-parsec
scales.

In Fig. 11 we show the flow magnitudes in G75 between 20
and 40 arcseconds spacing for N1 and N2 respectively (cf. Fig.
1). The N1-panel shows only little orientation towards the fila-
ment for both distances, but seems to be more influenced by the
eastern direction, towards N2 (Fig. 11). The N2-plot depicts a
dominating mass flow rate in N1-direction for close proximity,
and an increasing contribution from the east for increasing dis-
tance. The southern clumps are shown in Fig. 12 without a clear
orientation towards CF. S1 interestingly shows a strong orienta-
tion in mass flow rate magnitude towards S2, and none in direc-
tion of CF. S2 on the other hand seems to be primarily influenced

proximity. We assume that both S1 and S2 are influenced by the
Hil-region in between them (Fig. 1).

The diagram for IRAS21078 presents itself relatively fea-
tureless for 0.14 pe distance (Fig. 13), but one can identify an
increased magnitude of the mass flow rate to the north-west -
in the direction of the largest filamentary structure. For increas-
ing distance, an influence from the south-eastern edge becomes
dominant however. The cloud has already been analyzed within
the CORE-sample and the analysis has shown that it hosts con-
verging flows of material towards its center (Moscadelli et al.
2021). The here presented mass flow direction does imply a po-
tential gas-infall, but the channeling through the filaments has to
be looked at in more detail. Comparing the two-dimensional spa-
tial direction from the mass flow magnitudes in Fig. 13 to the first

moment maps in Figs. 2 and 3 shows velocity differences along
the structure of HCO* and H'°CO* prominently in the north-
western direction, towards the elongated filament-structure. We
also note strong HCO* velocity differences at the southern edge
of the cloud (none for H'CO* because of missing data). This
possibly indicates infalling material, which is transported later-
ally onto the structure. The seemingly increasing velocity gra-
dient towards blue-shifted gas at more densely packed contour
lines of the dust continuum may indicate increasing dynamics
due to channeling of the material closer to the center. This is
however speculative as this assessment largely rests upon the
HCO* and H'CO* first moment maps alone. One always has
to consider the presence of the Hil-regions, which likely cause
alterations in potential gravitationally-driven infall via feedback-
processes. This has to be noted especially for IRAS21078, where

the extent of the Hil-region covers almost the whole source (Fig.
1 lower panel).

As for NGC7538, we can see the diagrams for IRS1, S and
IRS9 clumps in Fig. 14 (for reference, see Fig. 1). IRS1 shows
more extended flow magnitudes towards the west, into the di-
rection of the F-NW filament that declines for increasing dis-
tance (about 0.52 pc), but remains the dominant value. This
probably can be explained by a strong velocity difference in
the H'CO*-data (Fig. 3). S indicates a more prominent flow-
direction towards the northern IRS1, especially for 0.52 pe dis-
tance. It is interesting to note that S seems to be influenced by
IRS1 but not vice versa. Assuming that the northern Hil-region
may have triggered the formation of IRS1, this region should be
slightly older than S. Hence influence of IRS1 on S but not the

other way round appears plausible. The mass flow-magnitude to-
wards S also yields no visible influence from the F-SW filament-
structure. For IRS9, both distances depict almost the same pat-
tern: the flow rate direction is concentrated to the southern half
of the circle with a more obvious contribution from the eastern
section than towards the filament connecting IRS9 with S (Fig.
1).

In order to obtain a more precise overview of the contributors
to the mass flow rate (Eq. (1)), we conducted the same separation
for X and Av as in section 3.2. We present the comparison-panels
for G75 N1 in Fig. 15, for IRAS21078 CC in Fig. 16 and for
NGC7538 IRS1 in Fig. 17. The diagrams for all other clumps
are shown in Appendix B.

For the most part, the velocity differences appear to have a
more dominant impact onto the “shape” of the polar magnitude-
distribution. For clump G75 N1 (Fig. 15) however, the surface
density seems to be the strongest contributor. We can for exam-
ple see that the strong flow rates in G75 S1 are dominated by
the velocity difference towards S2 (Fig. B.2), while the surface
density shows orientation towards the east and does not align
at all with the expected filament direction (red dot) and only to
a small degree with the velocity differences. The same holds for
$2 towards S1 (Fig. B.3). IRAS21078 CC exhibits one spike into
F-NW direction that clearly stems from the velocity difference
for close distance (Fig. 16). The same holds for the outer annu-
lus, where the surface density now points into F-NW direction,
but the velocity difference towards the south-east is stronger and
thus affects the overall mass flow to a larger degree. This also is
visible for NGC7538S (Fig. B.4).

As we summarize in Fig. 18, the peak-values for all of the
mass flow rates occur in the outer annulus of 40”. This indicates
a larger fraction of mass being transported towards the clumps
on the larger scale.

4. Discussion, conclusions and summary

In this paper, we analyzed the kinematics of molecular gas in
three high-mass star-forming molecular clouds. In order to do

this, we estimated the mass flow rates and divided the analy-
sis into mass flows along filamentary structures and flows onto
clumps. Both approaches indicate that mass is transported along
these structures. Along filamentary cloud-structures, we notice
increasing mass flow magnitudes close to denser regions. The
peak values are in the order of 10-3 M, for G75 and 107° Mz and
10-4 Mg for IRAS21078 and NGC7538 respectively. As given in
Table 3, we note that IRAS21078 is a lower mass clump which
therefore exhibits the lowest overall mass flow rate.

The analysis of the flows onto clumps focused on the in-
terpretation of polar diagrams, that show the orientation of the
mass flow rate magnitude towards a clump. In G75, the direc-
tion of strongest mass flow rate indicates a potential feeding of
the northern half of the cloud through the central connecting
filament-structure. Similar patterns appear in NGC7538 for the
two clumps IRS1 and S. As for IRAS21078, the distribution of
the flow rates indicates infall from the north-western filament-
structure, but one has to bear in mind the comparably large er-
rors; it however appears possible that infall of material through
these channels occurs, as it already has been subjected to studies
with similar findings on smaller spatial scales.

The separation of the two main contributors to the mass flow
rates into velocity difference and surface density showed inter-
esting patterns for both methods: as for the flows along the G75
CF-structure, the surface density dictates the overall shape of the
curve; spikes are on the other hand contributed by steep veloc-
ity differences. Sharp increases in velocity differences often af-
fect the mass flow curve to a large degree, and the data indicate
that they often stem from feedback from the Hll-regions. In the
case of the polar diagrams, the orientation of the surface den-
sity towards filament-structures was sometimes not visible due
to a strong velocity difference into a different direction. There
are cases however, where the two factors of the mass flow rate
equation are more aligned. This is overall very interesting, since
an orientated distribution of dust for close proximity might hint
at channel- or filament-structures that serve as a gas-funnel. The
fact that the larger velocity differences sometimes do not point
toward adjacent clump- or filament direction might be caused
by expanding shells from nearby Hll-regions; this very likely
is the case for G75 S1 and S2. As for the clumps were we
also spot velocity differences into filament-directions, we can
assume that it potentially is accretionally-driven through the fil-
aments. For the regions were this behavior does not occur, we
can tentatively infer that the Hil-regions are responsible due to
feedback-processes: this assessment is supported by the fact that
all clumps that show flow rate magnitudes in unexpected direc-
tions in the polar plots are located close to a Hil-region.

Similar to the assertion of a dominant contributor in the mass
flow rate, large flow-magnitude values close to the edge of a
cloud (cf. Fig. 14) do not necessarily imply increasing dynam-
ics in the gas flow, but could just be a consequence of the steep
gradient in the surface density profile (cf. Eq. (1) and Fig. 1, es-
pecially in the vicinity of IRS1 and IRS9 in NGC7538 that are
located close to the edge of the 1.2 mm dust emission).

If we assume that the accretion is mainly gravitationally-
driven close to denser regions (e.g. clumps), the material should
fall onto the clumps; driving mechanisms like turbulence on
larger scales have been numerically studied by e.g. Padoan et al.
2020. Large-scale infall would predecess fragmentation of the
cloud and further collapse of proto-stars that exceed their indi-
vidual Jeans mass (Vazquez-Semadeni et al. 2019). In the case
of the here presented regions, we found strong indications for
feedback processes to be the driving force behind gas dynam-
ics in the clouds. The regions with Hil-regions can differ in their

behavior, and the plots indicate that they certainly do. Their in-
fluence is strongly noticeable in disrupted flow-behavior and the
lack of molecular line data (Fig. 1). For this reason, especially
the north-western part of NGC7538 has to be excluded from the
accreting-flow assessment in general due to the Hil-region (e.g.
Beuther et al. 2022) (see also Sect. 3 and Fig. 1). Filaments ap-
pear at the boundaries of HlI-regions in all presented sources
with strong indications for enhanced mass flow. This supports
the simulations predicting filament formation at the crossing of
shocks (e.g. Pudritz & Kevlahan 2013). We did only include the
analysis for the HCO* and H'?CO*-molecules in the main sec-
tion, since the other molecules that exhibit a similar spatial dis-
tribution (e.g. HCN and H,CO) did not yield additional informa-
tion in their apparent kinematics.

Fig. C.2. Moment zero maps of the H41a@ recombination line, tracing free-free contribution. Black contours outline the free-free corrected 1.2 mm
dust continuum (except for IRAS21078) on log-scale starting from So (except for IRAS21078 starting from 30°) to peak value for reference.
While for G75 (left panel) and NGC7538 (right panel) the strongest emission fits the contours in the lower panels of Fig. 1, the middle panel for
TRAS21078 shows only noise and no significant contribution from the Hil-region outlined in NVSS. The edges have been set to values of zero in
order to get rid of stripe artifacts from the OTF scanning process. All blank spots represent zero values due to the log-scaling.
