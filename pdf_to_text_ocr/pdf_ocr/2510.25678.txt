ABSTRACT
Powerful, large-scale relativistic jets are usually associated with massive, old elliptical galaxies. This
aradigm has recently been challenged by the identification of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies,
thought to be young active galactic nuclei with low-mass black holes, harboring relativistic jets. Among
hem, sources hosting >100 kpc radio jets are extremely rare. Here, we report the discovery of large-
scale, double-lobed radio structures in 33 NLSyls with the projected linear size of at least 100 kpc
from a recently published catalog of 22656 NLSy1 galaxies. These 33 include 29 confirmed double-
lobed sources and 4 candidates whose radio structure require further study. We suggest that their low
lack hole masses are unlikely to be due to their small angles of inclination to the line of sight. These
enigmatic sources were identified by examining the radio observations taken with the Faint Images
of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters, Very Large Array Sky Survey, Low Frequency Array, and
Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey. Among them, the NLSy1 source J1318+2626 (z = 0.62) is found
o host a radio jet with the projected linear size of 4.3 Mpc, making it the only NLSy1 galaxy hosting
a Mpc-scale radio jet known as of today. We conclude that future observations of NLSy1 sources
with the next-generation of sensitive telescopes may reveal a much larger population harboring large-
scale jets, thus providing crucial clues on their origin, propagation, and interaction with the ambient

environment.

1. INTRODUCTION

Active galactic nuclei (AGN), whose luminosity can
range up to ~ 1048 erg s~! (e.g. Padovani et al. 2017),
are believed to be powered by accretion of matter onto
supermassive black holes (SMBHs, 10° — 10!° Mo; e.g.,
Woo & Urry 2002). The observed emission over a wide
range of wavelengths from AGN is mainly driven by the
mass and spin of the SMBHs, and the mass accretion
rate along with the orientation of the source axes to the
line of sight (Antonucci 1993).

Among the AGN are the narrow-line Seyfert 1
(NLSy1) galaxies, identified as a separate class about

four decades ago. They are characterized by the rela-
tive narrowness of their broad emission lines with full
width at half maximum of the broad Hf emission line
less than 2000 km s~!, weak [OIII] lines relative to H8
with [OII]/H8 < 3 and strong Fell multiplet emission
(Osterbrock & Pogge 1985; Goodrich 1989). However,
it has been suggested that the narrow H@ lines in their
spectra could be because of their orientation, with their
broad line regions seen pole-on (cf. Decarli et al. 2008).

NLSy1 galaxies are believed to be powered by low
mass black holes (10°-§ Mg), having higher accretion
rates, and predominantly hosted by spiral/disk galaxies
undergoing rapid star-formation activity (e.g., Mathur
2000; Boroson & Green 1992; Jarvela et al. 2018; Var-
glund et al. 2022, 2023; Sani et al. 2010; Caccianiga et al.
2015). Mathur (2000) suggested that NLSy1 galaxies
could be young, rejuvenated AGN in the galaxy evolu-

tion scheme. However, some studies do point to NLSyl
galaxies having SMBH masses no different from their
broad line counterparts, namely the broad-line Seyfert
1 (BLSy1) galaxies (Calderone et al. 2013; Baldi et al.
2016; Liu et al. 2016; Rakshit & Stalin 2017; Viswanath
al. 2019).

In X-rays, NLSy1 sources exhibit a steep 2-10 keV
power-law spectrum with strong excess at energies below
2 keV (e.g., Boller et al. 1996; Griinwald et al. 2023) and
show large amplitude X-ray flux variability (cf. Boller
| al. 1996; Leighly 1999; Rani et al. 2017). The hosts
of NLSy1 galaxies are believed to be spiral/disks (see,
e.g., Crenshaw et al. 2003; Jarvela et al. 2018; Varglund
et al. 2022, 2023). However, elliptical hosts are also
known, as for example in a few y-ray emitting NLSy1
galaxies (see, e.g., D’Ammando et al. 2017, 2018).

A small fraction of about 5% of the known NLSy1 pop-
ulation are found to emit radio emission (Zhou et al.
2006; Rakshit et al. 2017). Among the radio-detected
NLSyls, about two-thirds are found to be radio loud
(Komossa et al. 2006; Zhou et al. 2006; Singh & Chand
2018). Interestingly, some NLSy1 galaxies exhibit strong
radio emission, with compact cores of high brightness
temperature, strong radio variability, as well as flat or
inverted radio spectra, pointing to these having rela-
tivistic jets similar to those of blazars (Yuan et al. 2008;
Gu et al. 2015; Lahteenmaki et al. 2017). Furthermore,
only a few NLSy1 galaxies are known to have extended
radio structures ranging from few tens of kpc to around
100 kpe (Doi et al. 2012; Rakshit et al. 2018; Doi et al.
2019; Vietri et al. 2022).
Interestingly, about two dozen radio-emitting NLSy1
galaxies are detected in the GeV band by the Large
Area Telescope onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space
Telescope (e.g., Abdo et al. 2009; Paliya et al. 2018,
2024b). The broad band spectral energy distribution
(SED) of these GeV emitting NLSy1 galaxies is similar
to that of the flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) cate-
gory of blazars, with the low-energy hump attributed
to the synchrotron emission process and the inverse-
Compton process contributing to the high energy hump
(cf. Paliya et al. 2019). The broad-band SED as well as
the parsec-scale radio polarimetric properties of the y-
emitting NLSy1 galaxies are similar to those of FSRQs
(Takamura et al. 2023), in accordance with the scenario
of GeV emitting NLSy1 galaxies being the low black hole
mass counterparts to FSRQs (Foschini et al. 2015; Paliya
et al. 2018, 2019). In a detailed study of two y—ray emit-
ting NLSy1 galaxies, Paliya et al. (2013) found these to
be of lower luminosity than FSRQs, and suggested that
their low-luminosity—low-frequency behavior could be
due to their low black hole masses. These observations

point to the unambiguous presence of relativistic jets in
a minority of NLSy1 galaxies. They also challenge the
notion that only AGN harboring massive black holes
and residing in elliptical hosts can launch large-scale
relativistic jets, contrary to AGN hosted by spiral/disk
galaxies and powered by low mass black holes (cf. Laor
2000). Even though GeV 4-rays are detected in a hand-
ful of NLSy1 galaxies pointing to the presence of rela-
tivistic jets, such jets in NLSyl galaxies are generally
rare, and even if present, they are usually less than a
few tens of kpc (Berton et al. 2018). However, large-
scale, collimated Faranoff Riley type II (FRU; Fanaroff
& Riley 1974) sources with sizes larger than 100 kpc
have been reported in two NLSy1 galaxies namely SDSS
J103024.95+551622.7 (116 kpc,Rakshit et al. 2018) an
6dFGS gJ035432.8—134008 (240 kpc, Vietri et al. 2022).
The rarity of large double-lobed radio sources in NLSy
galaxies, points to either the failure of these objects to
aunch large-scale radio jets or/and an underestimation
of the numbers due to limitations of the radio surveys.
With the availability of the largest sample of NLSy
galaxies (Paliya et al. 2024b) and a number of sensi-
ive, high-resolution radio surveys including at low fre-
quencies, we examine the occurrence and properties o!
arge, double-lobed radio sources greater than about 100
pe associated with NLSyl galaxies in this paper. In
Section 2 we briefly describe the sample selection. The
details of the radio surveys used and the methodology
adopted to estimate their physical parameters are ex-
plained in Section 3. The results and discussion are
presented in Section 4, and the concluding remarks are
in Section 5. Throughout, we used a flat cosmology with
Ho = 70 km s~! Mpe7! and Qy, = 0.3.

2. SAMPLE SELECTION

We have used the recently released catalog of NLSy1
galaxies by Paliya et al. (2024b). This contains a total
of 22656 NLSyl galaxies with redshifts <0.9, selected
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release
17. This new catalog has more than twice the number of
previously identified NLSy1 galaxies and supersedes the
earlier catalogs published by Zhou et al. (2006) and Rak-
shit et al. (2017). We cross-matched these NLSy1 galax-
ies with the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty
Centimeters survey (FIRST; Becker et al. (1995)) cata-
log within a search radius of 5 arcsec. This led us to a
sample of 730 NLSy1 galaxies that are detected in radio
by FIRST survey. Details on the radio properties of all
these sources will be published elsewhere (Umayal et al.,
in preparation).

In this work, we attempt to identify double-lobed ra-
dio structures with projected linear sizes of at least 100
kpe in the radio-detected NLSyl1 galaxies, and study
their properties. To achieve these objectives, we ex-
amined each of the 730 FIRST-detected NLSy1 galax-
ies, by overlaying their optical r-band images from the
Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response Sys-
tem (Pan-STARRS; Chambers et al. (2016)), with the
radio images covering a 10x10 arcmin? region from
FIRST, the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS; Lacy
et al. (2020)), the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey
(RACS; McConnell et al. (2020)) at 887 MHz, the LOw
Frequency ARray (LOFAR; van Haarlem et al. (2013))
survey with both 6-arcsec and 20-arcsec resolutions, and
NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS; Condon et al. 1998).
In order to explore the possibility of diffuse extended
emission which may be missed at higher frequencies
with limited sensitivity, we also examined the sensitive,
low-frequency LOFAR images over a region of 30x30
arcmin?. The details of the radio surveys are given in
Table 1.

To identify NLSyls with projected linear sizes of at
least 100 kpc, the radio contours of each of the 730
sources from the considered radio surveys were super-
posed on the r-band image from Pan-STARRS. The con-
tours were plotted starting from the 30 level in powers
of two, where o is the rms noise estimated locally. In
addition, for an initial screening, circles of diameter 100

kpc were drawn around the target sources, which were
derived from their respective redshifts. Sources with ev-
idence of bipolar radio emission on opposite sides of the
radio core or nucleus of the host galaxy, including sig-
nificantly misaligned sources such as those reminiscent
of Wide Angle Tailed (WAT) sources, were considered.
Intrinsic misalignments may also appear amplified when
sources are inclined at small angles to the line of sight
(e.g. Kapahi & Saikia 1982).

For each candidate source whose size is likely to be at
least 100 kpc, the largest angular sizes (LAS, in”) were
accurately measured. For a radio lobe with a prominent
hotspot at the outer edge, the angular separation was
measured from the brightest pixel in the hotspot to the
radio core or nucleus of the host galaxy. For a source
with a diffuse outer lobe, the separation was measured
from the farthest 30 brightness contour to the radio core.
The separations of the two outer lobes from the radio
core or nucleus of the host galaxy, estimated from an
image where the overall structure is best represented,
were added to derive the LAS for each source, and then
converted to a projected linear size, Dpro}-

4, RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A careful inspection of the cutout images taken from
different radio surveys (Table 1) has resulted in a sam-
ple of 34 NLSy1s with projected linear sizes of at least
100 kpe. Among them, J1030+5516 was reported ear-
lier (Rakshit et al. 2018), while the remaining 33 are
new identifications. For four of these, J1018+2821,
J1048+2856, J1110+3653 and J1127+3620, radio im-
ages of higher sensitivity and/or resolution would be
helpful to image the detailed structure. We have marked
these as ‘candidates’ in Table 2 with a superscript © af-
ter the source name. All 34 objects are listed in Table 2,
together with their physical parameters. The absolute
B-band magnitudes (column 5, Mg) and the masses of
the SMBHs (column 6, Mgu) are from Paliya et al.
(2024b). The radio morphological classification (column
9) is based on images that best represent the structure
from which the LAS were estimated; the respective sur-
veys used are listed in column 14.

Table 2 also lists the degree of core prominence, Cp,
defined as the ratio of core to extended flux density
Feore/Fext at a rest frame frequency of 3 GHz, in column
10. For each of the sources, we measured the radio core
flux density (Feore) from the high-resolution VLASS, else
rom FIRST images, bounded by their corresponding
radio beams centered at the core. Similarly, the total
flux density (Ftotai) was from the low-resolution images,
which was NVSS in most of the sources. Fyotal was es-
imated within the 30 level, which includes weak and
iffuse radio emission from the radio lobes and excludes
any possible unrelated sources in the vicinity. The Ftotai
and Fext = Ftotat — Feore were extrapolated to the rest
rame frequency at 3 GHz with spectral indices Qcore =
0 and ext = —0.8, where the spectral index a is defined
as F, x v®, where F,, is the flux density at frequency v.
Cp is given by the expression (Paliya et al. 2024a)

LARGE-SCALE RADIO SOURCES IN NLSy1 GALAXIES 7

The k-corrected extended luminosities in column 11
were calculated using the relation

Lext = 40D? Foxe (1 + z)7 tee), (2)

Then the extended kinetic jet power (column 12) of
the sources was calculated using the following relation
(Hardcastle (2018))

Qiet

L330 = 3 x 10° 5 ESI (3)

The integrated radio spectral indices (a) of the sources
(column 13) are from Stein et al. (2021), when available.
Otherwise, they have been evaluated from a linear least-
squares fit to the available data (indicated by a single
asterisk) or in three cases without adequate data the
two-point spectral index values have been listed and in-
dicated by double asterisks.

The FIRST, VLASS, LOFAR and RACS contours of
all these 34 sources, wherever available, superposed on
the r—band images from Pan—STARRS are shown in
Fig. 1.

The detection of extended radio emission on the >
100-kpe scale in NLSyl galaxies has been relatively
rare. Until now, only two such sources, J1030+5516
and J0354—1340 have been reported with projected sizes
exceeding 100 kpe (Rakshit et al. 2018; Vietri et al.
2022). Through a careful study of 730 NLSy1 sources
detected in the FIRST survey from the largest com-
pilation of 22,656 NLSyl galaxies, we have identified
34 NLSy1 galaxies (including J1030+5516 reported by
Rakshit et al. 2018) with Dp:oj > 100 kpe. J0354—1340
(Vietri et al. 2022) does not appear in our list as it
is outside SDSS coverage area, hence absent from the
NLSy1 catalog used in this work. High-resolution obser-
vations may resolve out the diffuse, extended emission,
but could be useful for detecting extended emission on
small scales. For example, of the 34 sources in our sam-
ple, three (J0146—0040, J1110+3653 and J1634+4809)
have been observed by Berton et al. (2018) with sub-
arcsec resolution with the VLA A-configuration at 5
GHz. In all three cases, the extended emission has been
resolved out.

The large increase is likely due to the following rea-
sons.

1. The use of a number of sensitive radio surveys, es-
pecially at low frequencies have facilitated the de-
tection of diffuse extended emission. For example,
the LOFAR observations were critical in detect-
ing the diffuse extended emission and determining
their projected linear sizes reliably in over 50% of
the sources in our sample. In many of these, the

extended emission would have been missed with-
out LOFAR observations (e.g., J0959+4600).

2. In the recent catalog of NLSyls by Paliya et al.
(2024b) the redshift range has been extended to
0.9 by using the results from the Baryon Oscilla-
tion Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) spectrographs.
The BOSS spectrographs have a larger wavelength
coverage than SDSS. Six of our sources have a red-
shift >0.8, the limit used for samples based on
the SDSS spectrographs (c.f. Rakshit et al. 2017;
Paliya et al. 2024b).

4.1. Radio structure and sizes

The Fanaroff-Riley classes of these sources are listed
in Column 9 of Table 2. Among these, 10 (~30%) are
FR II doubles, 21 (~60%) are FR Is, and 3 (~10%)
have been classified as FR I-IIs. A ‘?’ has been put
against those where better images would help confirm
heir classification. J0038—0207 exhibits an X-shaped
structure while 8 have structures reminiscent of wide-
angle tailed sources.

Doi et al. (2012) noted that the majority of NLSyls
nown to have kpc-scale structure at that time were
FR Ils, unlike what we find for our sample. The detec-
ion of a large number of FR I sources has been possible
argely due to the use of sensitive low-frequency radio
surveys, such as LOFAR.

Their projected linear sizes Dproj range from 100 kpc
o 4345 kpc, with a median value of 285 kpc. The largest
one J1318+2626 has been listed as a giant radio galaxy
(GRG) by Andernach & Briiggen (2025), and is the only
NLSy1 hosting Mpc-scale jet known to date. A GRG is
defined to be one with a projected linear size Dpyoj > 700
kpe (see Dabhade et al. 2023, for a review). Our sample
contains three other GRGs, J0731+3204, J0733+4211,
and J1447+0806 with Dproj of 704.5, 867.3 and 791.3 kpe
respectively. The log of mass of the SMBHs in units of
Mo of these three GRGs are 6.23, 6.70 and 6.91 respec-
tively, while that of J1318+2626 is 7.46. The presence of
such gigantic structures originating from relatively low
mass SMBHs hosted in NLSy1 galaxies poses interesting
challenges in understanding the formation and launch-
ing of such large-scale jets.

4.2. Comparison with radio-detected NLSy1s

Here we briefly compare some of the properties of
the NLSy1 sources >100 kpc, with other radio-detected
NLSy1 sources, referred to as the radio-detected NLSy1
sample. We wish to explore any characteristics of the
NLSy1l >100 kpe sources that enable them to launch
these large-scale jets.

The redshift distributions of the two samples are
shown in the top left panel of Fig. 2. The median values
are 0.42 and 0.64 for the radio-detected NLSy1 and the
NLSy1 >100 kpe sources respectively, suggesting that
the latter are seen at higher redshifts. A Kolmogorov-
Smirnov test shows the two distributions to be signif-
icantly different with a p-value < 0.01. This is likely
due to the latest radio surveys being able to capture the
faint, diffuse emission originating from these more dis-
tant objects. The bolometric luminosity distributions
of the two samples (Fig. 2, top middle panel) show that
these are similar. The logarithmic median values, in
Watt, are 38.02 and 37.95 for the radio-detected and the
NLSy1 >100 kpc samples respectively. A Kolmogoroy-
Smirnov test yields a p-value of 0.43 showing that the
two distributions are similar. A comparison of the radio-
loudness parameter Ry, shows that the NLSy1 >100 kpe
have significantly higher values with a median at 525,
compared with 15 for radio-detected sources (Fig. 2,
top right panel). A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test shows
the two distributions to be significantly different with
a p-value < 0.01. In fact, a majority of the >100 kpc
NLSy1 sources (28/34, ~80%) have a high Ry > 100,
and all the sources are radio loud with the exception
of J0146—0040, which has a value (Ry = 7.1) slightly
lower than the threshold of Ry = 10 (Kellermann et al.

00 kpe NLSy1s.

1989), primarily because of it being extremely faint in
he FIRST survey data.

The median values of the absolute B-band magni-
ude Mg values (Fig. 2, bottom left panel) are —22.17
and —22.75 for the radio-detected and >100 kpc NLSy1
sources respectively. The >100 kpc sources tend to be
only marginally more luminous. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov
est yields a p-value of 0.08, consistent with only a

marginal difference.

The Mgy distributions (Fig. 2, bottom middle panel)
show that the median values of logarithmic Mpu are 6.99
and 7.24 for the radio-detected and >100 kpc NLSyls
respectively. The ones hosting >100 kpc radio structure
appear to be more massive. In this case, a Kolmogorov-
Smirnov test yields a p-value of 0.027, suggesting that
he two distributions are different. The logarithmic Mpu
distribution for the radio undetected NLSy1s is similar
o that of the radio-detected ones, with a median value of
6.98, both being smaller than for the >100 kpc NLSy1s.

The Eddington ratio Rgpp distributions (Fig. 2, bot-
om right panel) show that the median values are —0.07
and —0.31 for the radio-detected and the >100 kpc
NLSy1s respectively. A Kolmogorov-Smirnoy test shows
he two distributions to be significantly different with a
p-value of <0.01. The lower value for the >100 kpc

LARGE-SCALE RADIO SOURCES IN NLSy1 GALAXIES 9

NLSy1s could be largely due to their higher black hole
masses.

To summarize, the >100 kpc NLSyls in our sample
tend to be at higher redshifts compared with the radio-
detected ones. The >100 kpc NLSyls are nearly all ra-
dio loud, with over 80 per cent having a value Ry, > 100.
Therefore, choosing the NLSy1s with Ry, > 100 increases
the probability of selecting those with large-scale jets.
Although the >100 kpc NLSy1s tend to have a slightly
higher black hole mass, this alone does not seem to be
the sole requirement as there are GRGs among the least:
massive ones. In addition, spin of the black hole and
availability of fuel for accretion over a long time scale
may also possibly be playing a role.

4.3. Orientation and core dominance

The core dominance parameter (Cp) has been used as
a statistical measure of the orientation of a source or jet
axis since the early days of the unification scheme for
AGN (e.g. Orr & Browne 1982; Kapahi & Saikia 1982).
As the viewing angle decreases, beamed emission from
the core dominates due to Doppler boosting, while the

extended lobe emission is largely isotropic. Attempts
have also been made to infer the orientation angle from
their symmetry parameters, such as the separation ra-
tio of the oppositely directed hotspots, and then esti-
mate their deprojected sizes (e.g. Rakshit et al. 2018).
If one assumes that the jets and the external environ-
ment are both symmetric, the receding hotspot is seen
at an earlier time due to light travel time across the
source, and appears closer to the core, while the ap-
proaching one appears farther. Also the approaching
one is expected to be brighter due to mild relativistic
beaming of the hotspots. However, there is increas-

ing evidence from symmetry parameters (Saikia et al.
2003; Saikia 2022, for a review) as well as distributions
of line-emitting gas (McCarthy et al. 1991) in power-

‘ul radio galaxies that sources are not intrinsically sym-
metric, making it difficult to infer orientation angles
from symmetry parameters. In our sample of >100
kpc NLSy1 sources too, there are several examples, such
as J0731+3204, J0733+4211, JO908+0450, J1439+4213
and J1617+1435, all of which are FRII sources, where
he nearer component is significantly brighter, under-

ining the importance of intrinsic asymmetries in the
environment.

Traditionally the arm-length ratio distribution for
a sample of high-luminosity FRII sources, where the
hotspots are well defined, has been used to estimate
he velocity of advancement of the hotspots, assuming
sources to be intrinsically symmetric and randomly ori-

ented in the sky. Such an exercise is not very meaningful

in a rich, complex cluster environment. Scheuer (1995)

arm-length ratios for luminous ra
gested that the maximum velocity

locity estimate from
io sources and sug-
of advancement for

the high-luminosity radio galaxies is likely to be <0.15c.

The median velocity of advancement
pact steep-spectrum radio sources
milli-arscsec scale observations of

of hotspots in com-
rom high-resolution
its motion is also

~0.1c¢ (cf. O'Dea & Saikia 2021). The NLSy1s are un-
likely to have a larger velocity of advancement than
these luminous radio galaxies and quasars with power-
ful jets. In order to explore whether reliable estimates
of orientation angles for our sample of NLSyl galax-
ies are possible, we consider the ten sources with an
FRII structure. Of these, for five of the sources listed
above, the nearer component is significantly brighter
showing that an asymmetric environment is playing a
dominant role. For the remaining five, adopting a ve-
locity of 0.15c as suggested by Scheuer (1995), only one
source, J1318+2626, yields a consistent angle of orien-
tation of about 32°. Before inferring orientation angles
from symmetry parameters, one needs a study of the
environments of these sources from optical and X-ray
observations.

We estimated Cp using Equation 1, obtaining values
ranging from —1.6 to 1.2, with a median value of —0.1
(Fig. 3). The FR I sources tend to have higher values of
Cp, with a median value of about 0.1, compared with
the FR II sources which have a median value of about
10 UMAYAL ET AL.

~ —0.6. These results are consistent with earlier stud-
ies. In a study of B2 radio galaxies, most of which were
lower-luminosity FR I sources, along with the more lu-
minous 3CR sources, de Ruiter et al. (1990) showed that
the core dominance decreased systematically with lumi-
nosity over about five decades. More recently, a similar
trend was also seen in the sample of y-ray emitting mis-
aligned AGN (Paliya et al. 2024a).

A small fraction of NLSy1 galaxies are known to ex-
hibit blazar-like characteristics (e.g. Yuan et al. 2008;
Gu et al. 2015; Lahteenmaki et al. 2017), and about
two dozen NLSy1 galaxies are known to be y—ray emit-
ters (Paliya 2019; Paliya et al. 2024b). From our sam-
ple, there are four sources (J0836+2728, J0949+1752,
J1127+3620 and J1520+4211) which appear in the sys-
tematically compiled catalog of blazars by Massaro et al.
(2015). These all have prominent cores with values of
Cp ranging from ~ —0.1 to 0.6, and flat radio spectral
indices with three of these having an inverted spectrum.
Of these, J0949+1752, J1127+3620 and J1520+4211 ap-
pear in the most recent list of y—ray emitting NLSyls
(Paliya et al. 2024b). The only other y—ray emitting
NLSy1 listed by Paliya et al. (2024b) is the X-shaped
source J0O038—0207, which has a relatively weak core
with Cp = —1.1 and asteep radio spectral index of —0.7.
More recently, Gabdnyi et al. (2025) have suggested
J0959+4600 to be associated with a y—ray source. It has
a dominant core with Cp=0.6 and a flat radio spectral
index of —0.1. Their core dominance and flat spectral
indices are consistent with these sources being inclined
at small angles to the line of sight.

There have been suggestions that the small black hole
masses estimated for NLSyls could be due to a geo-
metrical effect. If the broad-line region has a disk-like
geometry, and its axis is inclined at a small angle to the
line of sight, the velocity estimate and hence the black
hole mass would be lower (e.g. Decarli et al. 2008). One
can examine this further using Cp as an indicator of the
orientation of the source. In this case one would expect
sources inclined at small angles to the line of sight to
have higher values of Cp and smaller black masses. In
the lower panel of Fig. 3, we plot Cp against the black
hole mass for our sample of sources and find no signifi-
cant trend. The median value of log of black hole mass
in units of solar mass for the blazars listed earlier, which
are expected to be inclined at small angles to the line
of sight, is ~7.6. Including the y—ray emitting NLSy1s,
the value is ~7.3. All of these but one (J0959+4600
with a value of 6.96) have a value >7. The GRGs, on
the other hand, are generally expected to be at large an-
gles to the line of sight. All the four GRGs in our sample
have an FR II structure and relatively weak cores with

values of Cp ranging from —1.2 to —0.2. The mass of the
black holes for three of the GRGs is less than 10’Mo,
with the largest one J1318+2626 having a logarithmic
value of 7.46 (in Me). These results suggest that orien-
tation may not be playing a dominant role in determina-
tion of black hole mass of the NLSy1s. In this context it
is also relevant to note that Berton et al. (2021) summa-
rized several arguments to rule out the possibility that
NLSyls are powered by black holes of high mass.

4.4. Radio luminosity-Projected size diagram

The radio luminosity-projected size (P-D) diagram
has been traditionally used to study the evolution of ra-
dio galaxies of different jet powers (Baldwin 1982; Kaiser
et al. 1997). In Fig. 4 we show our sample of >100 kpc
NLSy1s along with LOFAR-detected objects from Hard-
castle et al. (2023). For this analysis, the extended flux
densities were calculated as Fext = Ftotal — Feore and ex-
trapolated to the rest frame at 178 MHz, assuming a
spectral index of dex, = —0.8. Almost all these sources
have a luminosity > 107° W/Hz, and span the en-
tire range of sizes from 100 kpc to about a Mpc, with
J1318+2626 being an outlier with a projected size of
about 4.3 Mpc. They lie in the upper region of the
P-—D diagram of the LOFAR sources, suggesting that
these follow a similar evolutionary path as other radio
galaxies of similar jet power.

5. CONCLUSIONS
LARGE-SCALE RADIO SOURCES IN NLSyl GALAXIES il

In this paper we report the discovery of 33 NLSyl
galaxies, with a projected linear size of at least 100 kpc.
These large-sized radio-emitting NLSyl galaxies were
found by cross-correlating the largest sample of 22,656
NLSy1 galaxies with the FIRST survey and then by ex-
amining their VLASS, LOFAR and RACS cutout im-
ages. In addition, J1030+5516 which is also in our sam-
ple was reported earlier (Rakshit et al. 2018), giving us
a sample of 34 sources. The NLSy1 galaxy J0354—1340
with a size >100 kpc (Vietri et al. 2022) is outside the
footprint of the SDSS survey, and hence did not appear
in our sample. We briefly summarize and comment on
the main results here.

1. This work has increased the number of known
galaxies with a projected linear size of at least
00 kpc. This has been possible due to the use
of a number of sensitive radio surveys, especially
LOFAR and RACS.

2. Earlier studies of NLSyl1 galaxies with extended
structure suggested that they may occur more fre-
quently in FR II sources. However, we find that
he majority of our sources belong to the FR I
category. This is also due to the use of the LO-
FAR survey data which is more sensitive to diffuse

extended emission.

3. The radio loudness parameter of the >100 kpc
LSyls is >100 for ~80 percent of the sources,
suggesting that selecting very radio-loud objects
could help identify more NLSyls hosting large-
scale jets.

4. Four of the NLSyls are GRGs, with J1318+2626
eing the largest with Dproj=4345 kpc.

5. The radio core dominance parameter of the sam-
les ranged from —1.6 to 1.2 with a median at
—0.1, and Cp is observed to be relatively higher
in FR I objects, consistent with earlier studies.

6. A small number of NLSy1s were also classified as
lazars, and some of them have also been detected
in the y—ray band. We find that these sources
end to have more dominant cores and flat radio
spectral indices, as expected due to their smaller
angles of inclination. However these do not tend
o have smaller black hole masses. On the other
1and, the GRGs which are expected to be inclined
at large angles of inclination, have smaller mass
lack holes. This suggests that orientation is not

laying a dominant role in the estimation of black

10le mass, contrary to an earlier suggestion.

7. The >100 kpc NLSy1s lie on a similar region as
other luminous radio galaxies in the luminosity-
size (P — D) diagram, suggesting that these may
also have a similar evolutionary history.

Upcoming sensitive surveys, especially at low radio
frequencies are likely to further increase significantly the
number of large >100 kpc NLSy1s. This would be useful
for detailed multi-wavelength studies of their properties
and for understanding the nature, formation, and evo-
lution of this interesting class of AGN.
