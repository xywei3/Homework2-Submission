Abstract

We present a fast method for obtaining fully analytical approximations for gravitational
waveforms produced by merging of neutron stars and/or black holes for the earliest stages of
the merger process. The obtained analytical formula is compared with numerical calculations,
its accuracy and limits of applicability are evaluted. Our results may be useful not only for the
earliest evalution of properties of the nature of binary system in gravitational-wave detectors
but also will give early alerts for gamma-ray, optical and neutrino observatories.

Introduction

The gravitational-wave signal from a pair of merging black holes was first detected in 2015 by
LIGO observatory detectors (Abbott et al., 2016). Gravitational waves (GW) are of considerable
interest, as they carry rich information about the parameters of merging black holes (BH) and
neutron stars (NS)—their masses, spins, and orbital dynamics. The GW analysis makes it
vossible to test various relativistic theories of gravity, as well as to study the formation of
binary systems in the early universe.

One of the most significant events was GW170817 gravitational-wave signal—the sixth
recorded gravitational-wave event and the first merger of the NS, accompanied by a short
gamma-ray burst GRB170817A (Abbott et al., 2017). This event brilliantly confirmed the
predictions of a short gamma-ray burst made in the papers of Blinnikov et al. (1984, 1990),
1owever, it is still unclear what happened within about two seconds after the loss of the gravi-
ational wave signal and before the registration of the gamma-ray burst.

Most GW detections are carried out using the matched filtering method (see, for example,
Weinstein and Zubakov, 1960; Dhurandhar and Satyaprakash, 1994). A weak gravitational
signal is detected in the noise by comparing it with one of the pre-modeled signals—a tem-
plate. Based on this, template banks are created (Owen, 1996; Ajith, et al., 2014; Allen, 2021;
Coogan et al., 2022; Vadekar et al., 2024; Sharma et al., 2024). The multidimensional space
of parameters on which the waveform depends should be optimally covered by such patterns,
minimizing computational costs while maintaining a high probability of detection. In the book
Dhurandhar, Mitra (2022), in section 9.7.1, the difficulties of covering the parameter space with
templates are described in detail.

The template banks used by LIGO are based either on the post-Newtonian (PN) formalism
for the convergence phase, or on the results of numerical calculations in GR—Numerical Relativ-
ity (NR) for the merger and ringdown phases. LIGO does not directly use numerical patterns in
real time, but uses analytical approximations interpolated from numerical data (Coakler, 2007;
Sakon et al., 2024).

However, in a number of cases, for example, at the initial search stage or in scenarios with
a large number of variables and parameters, there is a need for faster analytical templates that
would effectively identify GW signals from binary systems. GW analytical templates provide
1igh computing speed with low computational costs.

The purpose of this work is to obtain an analytical template for a close binary system at

he earliest stages of convergence using the computer algebra systems MAXIMA and WOLFRAM
IATHEMATICA. The motivation for us was the paper by Buskirk and Babiuc-Hamilton (2019),
which claimed to provide an entirely analytical solution, but actually used numerical solutions
of differential equations in WOLFRAM language, which, of course, does not allow one to calculate
he GW-forms quickly.
In this note, we give only a brief description of the idea of our approach to a simplified
problem for spinless relativistic stars in a binary system with circular orbits in the point mass
approximation. This approach is easily developed for the more general case of stars with spins
and nonzero orbital eccentricities. Unlike Buskirk and Babiuc-Hamilton (2019), we managed to
obtain a fully analytical expression.

1 Postnewtonian and other formalisms

According to the general theory of relativity, the evolution of a two-body system is described
by nonlinear Einstein equations that relate the curvature of space-time and the distribution of
energy and momentum (Landau and Lifshitz, 1988). There are three stages in the evolution of
a binary system: inspiral, merger, and ringdown. The equations in the first and third stages
can be reduced to a linear form and calculated analytically, whereas for the pre-merger stage it
is necessary to use NR methods.

At the inspiral stage, the binary system loses energy due to GW radiation. Denote by E(t)
the dependence of the total energy of the binary system on time t, F radiation loss power
(Peters, 1964):
dE
— = FE, 1
dt (1)
For example, in Tichy et al. (2000), the following expression is proposed for F as a function of
the velocity of circulation of v:

32 yvl? ok vy v®
F(v) = 51 a0 14 is. { Yogemn(2) E+...
k=2 k=6

where 7 = M,M»/M? is the symmetric mass ratio in a binary system—see the definitions of
these quantities below, after (4). cis the speed of light. The ellipsis in indicate possible terms
proportional to the logarithms (v/c)* to various powers for k > 2, which may occur in higher
orders of post-Newtonian corrections. Tichy et al. (2000) work in natural units of Gy =c=1.
Alternatively, an equation can be written for the loss of angular momentum by the system, but
in the point mass approximation these two approaches are equivalent.

At the inspiral stage, the dynamics of the system is well described by the PN theory (Buo-
nanno et al., 2009; Hannam et al., 2014; Taracchini et al., 2014). The various orders of the
post-Newtonian approximation are characterized by powers of a small parameter 2, called the
post-Newtonian parameter (PN parameter):

(2)

A correction of the order of (v/c)” to the Newtonian equation of motion is accounted for as
an order of n/2 in the PN approximation. Thus, the equation of motion for two bodies in the
PN expansion is written symbolically as follows:

GyM [, Aap

n=2

where r is the distance between the stars (in this paper we consider them point-like), Gy is the
Newtonian constant, M = M, + Mo is the total mass of the system of stars with masses of 4,
and M2, An/2 — expressions that depend on the physical parameters of the system (velocities,
coordinates, masses, spins, etc.) and correspond to the n/2 order of PN approximation.

Below we use the coefficients from the formulas of the paper by Huerta et al. (2017), which
is called the “Complete waveform model for compact binaries on eccentric orbits”. However, the
full form here is not completely analytical, since, for example, the phase ®(t) requires numerical
integration of equations for the evolution of the orbit. Recently, even more long analytical ex-
pressions for the GW form have appeared, for example, the multipolar Postminkovsky (MPM)
formalism developed by Blanchet, Damour and Ayer (Blanchet, 2024). This set of approxi-
mation methods (called MPM-PN) has been successfully applied to compact binary systems,
which made it possible to obtain equations of motion up to the fourth post-Newtonian order
4PN), and the shape of the GW and flow up to 4.5PN order, which surpasses the degree of
approximation of the quadrupole Einstein formula (see also Dlapa et al., 2022; Dlapa et al.,
2023).

The method proposed in this paper makes it possible to obtain a fully analytical expression
for the evolution of the orbit in the various above-mentioned formalisms for the earliest stages
of convergence, which are important for the rapid discovery of new sources of GW.

2 Transformation of expressions to analytical form

Formula is rewritten in the form (Buskirk, Babiuc-Hamilton, 2019) in terms of «x (see. [3):

dz F _
dt dE/dx’ (5)
Approximants from Ajith and Fotopoulos (2014) are used to find x, as a result of which the
following equation can be obtained (Huerta et al., 2017):

dx _ 64 na” k
ae a (1+ Sat), (6)

where 7 = /M, p = M,M2/M is the reduced mass, a; is the coefficients from the paper by
Huerta et al. (2017), depending on 77 and log(a). Formally, the expression (6 looks like an
approximation of 6PN. In fact, the evolution at the convergence stage is strictly described by
the equations for the energy flux up to 3PN order, and for slightly non-circular orbits up to
3.5PN order with corrections including 6PN order.

The right-hand-side in (6) is a function which looks as a polynomial in powers of x, A(x) =
asx” + agx® +... + ayal, but the coefficients a; may contain some powers of log(x). The
equation will then look like

Here is the crucial difference between our work and that of Buskirk and Babiuc-
Hamilton (2019). They use numerical integration of the equation (7). which contradicts the
title of their article “fully analytical form” of the equation. The main idea of our work is basec

on the following observation. Instead of directly solving the equation we note that it can be

rewritten as
dx

Ala) = dt, (8

using the method of separating variables.

Let us define 2 ac
I4(x) = / Se . 9

where is the lower limit of integration the value of the lower bound PN of the parameter,
iow see below, the expression (15).

This integral cannot be solved analytically, however, it is possible to carry out transforma-
tions that will allow us to obtain an analytical result in good approximation.

To do this, we pull out the term asx° = ax°, writing down A(x) = ax® + (x), and rewrite

the expression as ;
IA(x) =| or (10)
Low adb(1 “fh ace)

Now, noting that ¢ < 1, we apply the taylor procedure of the MAXIMA package to the following
expression at ¢ = 0:

+ oe
As is known, the taylor procedure for non-analytic functions at zero, especially radicals
and logarithms, uses other approximations, which is not a pure Taylor expansion. Our function
b(¢) has many logarithms and fractional powers. As an example, we present the expansion up
to the 2nd order to show the MAXIMA output:

Ia(x) = See | 1+ (2.211342. —12.566¢1°+(3.0103+5.38599+4.284777)C? | dc.
A(®) [- 3.599 - 105703 | +(2.2113+2.757)¢—12.566¢!°+(3.0103-+5.38597-+4.284717)C? | d¢

(12)
The WOLFRAM procedure Series outputs an equivalent expression. Both taylor and Series
can construct standard Taylor series, as well as certain expansions involving negative powers,
fractional powers, and logarithms.

Having expansions like (12), we easily obtain an analytical expression of the integration
result, the full form of which is given in the Appendix In our calculations, we used
expansions up to the 4th and 6th orders and compared their accuracy (see the tables below).

The equation will then have the form

Ia(z) =t4+C. (13)

4
As can be seen from the equation above, the resulting dependence x(t) is implicit. The
constant C can be found as follows:

Ta(a | =,
a(z)} =e,
and, considering that 7 = Xjow at t = 0, we get

C= La(tow)-

By similar reasoning, we obtain that [a(xnign) = ter + La(@iow), where Thigh is the upper
bound of the PN parameter, t.,—the time at which the PN parameter grows significantly and
the resulting formula is not valid anymore. This time approximately coincides with the time
of merger obtained by other methods (note that our formulae are correct only at the early
stages of inspiral). The result of the analytical calculation for ¢ = I4(x) — I4(ajow) is given in
Appendix

The lower limit of the PN parameter is determined by the detectable range of LIGO detectors.
The physical limitations of the detector result from seismic, quantum and thermal noise, which
limit detection at frequencies below the threshold value of fiow = 10 Hz (LIGO Collaboration,
2015), as well as from technical limitations, due to which the sensitivity of the detector is reduced
at low frequencies. Thus, signals from supermassive BH mergers are not recorded, since the
frequency of such events is below 10~4 Hz.

The orbital rotation velocity corresponding to fiow is (Blanchet, 2002)

U9 = Wow? = (Gy Murrow)" , (14)

where Wiow/7 = flow is the orbital angular frequency of the binary system. The frequency of
the gravitational wave is equal to twice the orbital frequency of the binary system (see, for
example, Zasov, Postnov, 2011, section A.4; Maggiore, 2008, vol. 1, section 4.1; Poisson, Will,
2014, section 11.4.6). Thus, the lower bound of the PN parameter is (Taney et al., 2016; Buskirk,

Babiuc-Hamilton, 2019)
ve GyM\?8
Tow = 2 = (ntiow = J : (15)

The upper bound PN of the parameter xpigh in the Schwarzschild field is determined by
the radius of the last stable orbit of the binary system (innermost stable circular orbit, ISCO):
risco = 3Rscn = 6GyM/ c?. In the Newtonian approximation, this radius corresponds to the
orbital velocity: visco = /GnM/risco = c/V6. Therefore, in the zero order, oe = 1/6. For
the second order PN approximation, an amendment can be introduced that takes into account
the dependence on the symmetric mass ratio 7 (Blanchet, 2024):

1 Oo
2PN
Lhich = ZIgGo = = (1 n). 16
high ISCO 6 ( + 18 ' ( )

Expressions for the angular phase and frequency in terms of the PN parameter are given as
follows:

The dependency w(t) (presented in the Appendix|A.2.1), again, as in the expression (13), is

implicit. To find the phase ®(t), we take the derivative of x on both parts of the expression (13):

Nie

(17)

dI,4(a) — dt

dx dx
and substitute this into the integral:

92) = fomat= [ Po(aar= | BO ear, (18)

dx da

which gives an implicit dependence of the phase on time. The result can be seen in the Ap-

pendix
Next, we can determine the evolution of the distance r(t) between rotating relativistic objects
over time. The distance between objects can be set in various PN approximation orders as
follows:

r(t) = Mr Na (ft er PN 42 PN ae) Hr PN (67), (19)

where r’PN are coefficients of the corresponding order of PN approximation. Following Buskirk

and Babiuc-Hamilton (2019), we take these coefficients from the paper by Hinder (2010). Ana-
lytical formulas for r and 7 are given in the Appendix [A.2.3]

In a linear approximation, gravitational waves can be represented as transverse waves with
two independent polarization modes, h, and hx.

Formulae for polarizations of GW (Hinder, 2010):

M : M .
hy (i) = 2G Ret ( ig Ga™ ) cos 28 + 2rrb sin20|, (20
Cc r
Mi be M ‘
hx (t) = 2G'n Ge 722 _ ON ) sino ari cos20 |, (21
LC ¥

The GW form is expressed in terms of polarization modes as follows (Apostolatos et al.
1994):

,

h(t) = h(t) — ih, (ft). (22

Following Buskirk and Babiuc-Hamilton (2019), we take the angle of inclination of the orbi
u (the angle between the vector of the orbital angular momentum and the observation line) to
be zero. The GW radiation is maximal along the axis of the orbital moment (see Maggiore,
2008, vol. 1, section 3.6), which creates an optimal orientation for its detection.

3 Results and Discussion

The analytical relationship of the PN parameter x and the time t, calculated using the for-
mula produced by MAXIMA, is given in the Appendix [AJ]
The tables indicate at what values [x; t] the discrepancy between the analytical and
numerical calculations for PN parameter « reaches 10-4 % 1 % for double systems with
different initial masses for a variaty of approximations (“Taylor” series expansion near zero to
orders 2, 4, and 6). The accuracy was estimated by determining the absolute error, normalized
for the critical time te,. It can be seen that for many binary BH systems (see Table (1). the
differences do not exceed 1%, which indicates the accuracy of the analytical formula obtained.
The formulae for the phase given in appendix [A.2.2] have approximately the same accuracy.
For binary NS systems (see table[2), the formula error does not exceed fractions of a percent.
This is due to the increased time before merging: the formula works fine for small values of the
PN parameter, which increases sharply only at the moment of merging. Expansion to the sixth
order gives the highest accuracy, on the order of a thousandth of a percent.

The obtained analytical formula can facilitate and accelerate the detection of merging objects
at the earliest stages. Analytical formulae explicitly relate the observed signal parameters
(frequency, phase, amplitude) to the physical characteristics of the system (masses, orbital
parameters) and this significantly increases the detection time of the signal.

This is especially true for NS systems. For example, for the NS + NS system with masses of
1.5Mo (standard mass of NS; see table 2) the time to merging (the time for which the system
can be monitored) reaches 900 seconds. For a similar GW170817 event, the detection time was
about 100 seconds (Abbott et al., 2017).

In the Figures one can see the evolution of the PN parameter over time for different
BH and NS systems. The time it takes to start monitoring depends on the mass of the system
and ranges from tens of seconds (for massive binary systems) to hundreds (for less massive
ones) for different systems. As we approach the moment of merging, the PN parameter grows
dramatically, and the resulting formula becomes inapplicable.

In the tables and graphs presented above, we checked the accuracy of the analytical formula
by comparing it with the result of a numerical expression calculated using MATHEMATICA. But
it is also interesting to check the accuracy of the numerical method itself used in MATHEMAT-
ICA, since Buskirk and Babiuc-Hamilton (2019) did not provide an indication of the accepted
accuracy of the numerical method. The figure [6] shows a comparison of our analytical formula
and two numerical results. NDSOLVE for different accuracy for the NS system (1+ 1)Mo.
Obviously, the amplitudes and periods are reproduced by different methods with comparable
accuracy, but differences in phase irreversibly arise due to the large number of periods of the
shape of the GW.

As is well known, the so-called chirp mass plays an important role in calculating the phase
of GW (Cutler and Flanagan, 1994):

(M.M2)3/
i

At the same time, the chirp frequency describes the rate at which this frequency increases
during the convergence stage, and is primarily determined by the chirp mass of the binary
system. This dependence is expressed by the equation:

ad \5 3

Monirp = ( 23 )

The chirp mass is not explicitly included in the formulas we use, however, it is interesting to
compare the chirp mass values using the formulas[23] and The Table[3]shows a comparison
of the chirp mass values calculated for the neutron star system.

It can be seen that at values of x 4 orders of magnitude lower than the threshold PN
parameter Xjow, the values of the chirp masses perfectly match, since the formula 223] is correct
in the OPN approximation. However, already at x = ajow, a noticeable error appears, which
grows with the growth of x.

So, thanks to the new analytical formula, it will be possible to detect gravitational wave
events much earlier. Due to this, high calculation speed and prompt event detection are achieved.
The explicit dependence on the parameters (mass, phase, distance between objects) is convenient
for subsequent data analysis.

Results

A fully analytical gravitational waveform template for close binary systems at the early stage
of merging is obtained.

The use of analytical templates of gravitational waves plays a key role in gravitational-wave
astronomy, as they allow one to quickly process data from detectors and effectively identify
significant events. Comparing the observed signals with theoretical models significantly speeds
up their detection. That is why the creation of accurate analytical and numerical models
describing this process remains one of the most important tasks of modern theoretical physics.

The formula obtained in this article may help one in quick detection and study of the
gravitational wave signal, especially in systems with low masses. For example, for neutron star
binaries, it is possible to detect and monitor them at the earliest stages of coalescence, up to
1ousands of seconds before ringdown.

We compare the numerical calculations with our analytical formula, evaluate its accuracy
and limits of applicability. We find that the error of the formula does not exceed 1% for all the
studied pairs of relativistic objects (BH + BH, BH + NS, and NS + NS), and for NS + NS
binaries the error is less than 10-4 % for most of the interval until the critical time tg,.

We thank V.E.Valiulin, N.K.Poraiko, A.V.Yudin, and N.I.Kramarev for their interest in our
udies and useful discussions.

We are grateful to the referees of the Astronomy Letters for their valuable comments, which
helped us to significantly improve the presentation of our results.

S.B. would like to acknowledge the support of Russian Science Foundation in the search of
ffective approximations for gravitational waveforms (RSF project 25-22-00293).
