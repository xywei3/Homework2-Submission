Group Representations of Lorentz Transformations
Extended to Superluminal Observers

Marco Zaopo*

Abstract

We construct an extension of the proper orthochronous Lorentz subgroup SO(3, vt
that includes space-time transformations for observers moving with superluminal relative
velocities in arbitrary direction. This extension is generated by the following realization of
the Klein four group Zz x Zz depending on polar and azimuthal angles identifying a spatial
direction:

(0,6) = {1, -T, Noo (8.0), —Noo (9,6) };

where A..(0,@) are involutive matrices arising as infinite-velocity limits of superluminal
boosts and satisfy A2, =I, det A,, = —1. The extension is:

Lext = (SO(3, IF x aaa, Ze) x Ze

where Zz is {-1,1}, the nontrivial automorphism Ada... is conjugation by A.o(9,¢) and con-
jugation with matrices corresponding to different values (0’, 4’) produces equivalent group
extensions. Lex_ has the same identity component SO(3, 1)t as the usual Lorentz group bu
components +A., in place of parity and time-reversal of O(3,1). Each transformation in
this extended group preserves the Minkowski form up to sign and can exchange timelike anc
spacelike directions. Passing to the extended Poincaré group Pext = R* » Lext, we classify
unitary irreducible representations (UIRs). The action of Lx; on momentum space merges
the timelike and spacelike SO(3, 1)}-orbits with invariants pp, = +M? into a single orbi
\p“py| = M?, while merges light-like SO(3, 1)f-orbits with po < 0 and po > 0. The resulting
induced UIRs for M ¥ 0 restrict to the ordinary Poincaré subgroup as a multiplicity-one
direct sum of a massive forward (pp > 0,p!py, > 0), a massive backward (po < 0,p"py, > 0)
and a tachyonic (pp, < 0) Wigner’s UIR, while for M = 0 as a multiplicity one direc
sum of a forward and backward massless Wigner’s UIR. We then derive wave equations
corresponding to solutions of the Casimir eigenvalue problem of Poincaré algebra obtained
differentiating the above representations. This set of equations contains all the wave equa-
tions known to date in quantum field theory together with new wave equations describing
tachyonic behaviour and a new class of massless representations. We finally show that
tachyonic wave functions provide a relevant representation theoretic tool for interpretation
of parity—violation phenomena in quantum field theory

1 Introduction

A first attempt to formally understand superluminal Lorentz transformations from a group
theoretical perspective is, in author’s knowledge, [16], where it is given a representation of sub-
luminal and superluminal Lorentz transformations employing complex space-time coordinates.
A first study of the same kind involving real space-time coordinates appears in [3] however
the authors of this paper only classify real representations of superluminal boosts with respect
to a static observer but do not classify representations of boosts between subluminal and su-
perluminal observers. In more recent years in a first attempt to represent boosts between
subluminal and superluminal observers in real space-time coordinates has been done. In that
paper it is defined a transformation between a subluminal and a superluminal observer and is
called ’superflip”. In this paper, based on the above works, we define, for the first time in
author’s knowledge a full classification of subluminal and superluminal Lorentz transformations
in 4 dimensions employing real coordinates. Here we achieve this exploiting a symmetry of
matrices representing Lorentz boosts with respect to the following conformal transformation of
the boost speed vector v:

Ur Vy Uz

The above is a particular case of a transformation known in geometry as ”6 Spheres Coordinates”
and is obtained by inverting the 3D Cartesian coordinates of the speed vector across the 2-sphere
of radius c. Exploiting the symmetry of Lorentz transformations with respect to the above we
are able to represent Lorentz boost for v in R® /{c} and not only in (—c,c) in real space-time
coordinates. We show that the set of matrices defined in this way form a group of space-time
transformations {A} such that:

v7 c(

|Ay|? = 4fo[? ful? = ov wo

where js is Minkowski metric and v a 4 vector. This group of transformations can send space-like
vectors into time-like vectors and vice-versa.
A quantum mechanical description of Tachyons has been subject of theoretical research
since the sixties. The first notable attempts in author’s opinion are [4]. These attempts,
though very accurate studies, assume that unitary representations of tachyons coincide with
those of massive particles and are unitary representations of SO(3). In [17] it is recognized that
those representations should be different and indeed tachyonic wavefunctions should come from
unitary representations of SO(2,1) and not SO(38) like standard particles. This conclusion is in
line with the original work done by Wigner in but still lacks to give a complete representation
of tachyonic wavefunctions. We here show that by including involutive “infinite-velocity” limits
of boosts, labelled by a spatial direction (6, ¢), one obtains a finite semidirect-product extension
of the proper orthochronous group:

Lext = (SO(3, 1)f Mad, Z2) x Ze,

where A..(0,¢) are involutive matrices with det A,, = —1 and A%, = I. This construction
respects local compactness and semidirect—product structure as discussed in harmonic-analysis

texts [11] [9].

We then proceed to the extended Poincaré group
Pext = R‘ x Lexts

and classify its unitary irreducible representations (UIRs) by applying Mackey induction tech-
niques in the presence of a finite extension. In doing so we find that the timelike and spacelike
orbits under the standard Poincaré group become unified under Lext into a single orbit with
invariant |p!p,| = M 2. The corresponding induced UIRs restrict to the usual Poincaré UIRs
(massive positive, massive negative, tachyonic) as a direct sum of multiplicity-one components.

Next, by differentiating the representation action we the generators of the extended Poincaré
algebra, including momentum and Lorentz operators, and thereby derives wave equations associ-
ated to the Casimir eigenvalue problems. These wave equations include the usual Klein-Gordon,
Dirac, Maxwell, as well as novel equations for tachyonic and new massless sectors permitted
by the extension. Finally, we demonstrate an application of the tachyonic wave functions to
reinterpret parity-violation phenomena in the weak interaction via representations of S'O(2, 1)
rather than SO(3).

2 Extension of Proper Orthochronous Group Beyond the Light
Speed Limit
2.1 Proper Orthochronous group

Lorentz transformations in special relativity are defined as a class of real 4x 4 matrices Ls(v, @),
depending on a relative velocity vector v € R® and a set of spatial axis orientations ©, which
satisfy the following [6]:

e All entries of L,(v, ©) are real;

e The matrix preserves the Minkowski metric p = diag(—1, 1, 1,1):

w= L,(v,0)uL,(v, 0); (1)

e The component (Ls)oo > 0;

e det Ls, = 1.
The general form of such transformations is
Ls(v, 0) = As(v) R(), (2)

where A,(v) denotes a collinear Lorentz boost and R(Q) a spatial rotation matrix. In Cartesian
coordinates, As(v) is given by

1s se ast ys
with i
Ys = Ks= 4-1 (4)

1 0 0 0
HE) = 0 cos(y’,x) cos(y’,y) cos(y’, z)
0 cos(z’,x) cos(z’,y) cos(z’,z)

(5)

in terms of the full set of cosines. As is well known every rotation matrix needs only three
parameters in order to be fully specified, and using Euler angles parametrization with Z-Y—Z
convention may be written as:

1 0 0 0
R(O =a.6.y) = f cosa cos 8 cos x — sinasiny —cosacosfsiny—sinacosy cosasin 3
(© =a, 8,x) = 0 sinacosGcosy +cosasiny —sinacosfsiny +cosacosy sinasin 3
0 —sin 8 cos x sin 6 sin x cos 8

Here, a € (0,27), 8 € [0,7], and y € [0, 277) are the Euler angles.
This class of transformations forms the proper orthochronous Lorentz group SO(3, ie :
2.2 Definition of Superluminal Lorentz Boosts

We now define superluminal boosts by extending this representation to velocities V € R? with
|V| > c. The corresponding matrices take the form

asy=| 82 tAsye Kee, Xone (6)
ie Ksyr lt+tkKsye Ks
with 1
Ys ao Ks =ys—1. (7)
lee

These matrices satisfy:

e All entries are real;
e They reverse the sign of the Minkowski metric:

—p= As(V) As(V); (8)

e The component (Ag)oo € R;

e det Ag = —1.
A bijective correspondence between subluminal and superluminal boosts is realized via the
map:
By.
yielding the relations:
\v| c
=V5— = V%e—— 10
Is = WS = WHT (10)
ViVi vr
sok HEM Keyl = By Hes (11)

IV? uf? *

Taking the limit A, = lim Ag(V)j\vj400, we obtain the matrix:

0 Ve Vy Vz

Vz Mea Vi Vy VeVe
_| WV IV] VI V]
Agioo) =| % way 4. _yM Ue)
lv IV? IV? IV?
Vz ViVz VyVe 4 _ Ve
a IV? Iv? IVP

This limit matrix depends only on the angular direction of V, and can be expressed in terms of
polar and azimuthal angle the speed vector forms in three space exploiting spherical coordinates.

We first recall:

Ve = sin cos ¢
Vy =sinésing

Vz = cos0

and then substitute the above relations into (12):

0 —sin@cos —sin@sind —cosé
oo (0,4) := - sinOcos@é 1—sin?@cos?¢ —sin?@cosdsingd —sin@cosécosd (13)
Sekenay § —sinésind —sin?@cosdsind 1-—sin?@sin?¢ —sin@cos@sing
| —cos@ —sin@cosOcos@ —sin@cosésingd 1 —cos?6

A similar construction yields the matrix A_..(0,@) = lim Ag(V)iyj4—ce:

VI IV] IV]

As(-co) = ly vay 1 VB WM (14)

and consequently:
0 sin @ cos & sin @ sing cos
A_x.(0,6) sin@cos# 1-—sin?@cos?¢ —sin?@cosdsind sinOcos@cos¢ (15)
oo sinésingd —sin?@cos¢sind 1—sin?@sin?¢  sin@cos@sind
cos @ —sin@cosOcos@ —sin@cos@singd 1 — cos? 6
we observe:
Axo(0, 6) = Aoo(0,) + = —A-o0(0, ¢). (16)

Thus, in particular, A..(9,¢) is an involution and satisfies:

Ax (0,¢) =1 (17)

2.3. Extension of Relativistic Frames Transformations

We are now going to study the multiplicative structure of the matrices defined so far. The set
of matrices, defined given a pair of azimuthal and polar angles (0, ¢),

Z0,9) = {1 -I, Aco, Aco} (18)

forms a discrete abelian group isomorphic to Zy x Zy where Zy = {+1}. In appendix it is
showed that:
As(V) = As(v)As(oo), (19)

where the subluminal velocity v and the superluminal velocity V are related via the involutive
map (9). Equation (19) expresses the fact that an observer moving with velocity v relative to
a rest frame is related, via an infinite-speed boost, to an observer moving at velocity V = c? /v
along the same direction. From (14), we note that the inverse of Ag(oo) is not Ag(—oo), but
rather —Ag(—oo). This is in contrast to ordinary Lorentz boosts, where the inverse of a boost
is given by reversing the sign of the velocity. Indeed, from (iG), we obtain

—A,(v) = As(V)As(—co), (20)

which shows that Ag(—oo) maps As(V) to —A,(v). Consequently, the negative identity matrix
—I is also an element of the closure of this set:

-I = Ag(00)As(-00). (21)

This observation was previously noted in [16] for a restricted subgroup (corresponding to 6 = 0
in (13) expressed in complexified spacetime coordinates.

We now derive the multiplication table involving products of superluminal and subluminal
boosts. Let the following subluminal boost with velocity v = (0,0, v-)

Ys 0 0 Ye
0 1 0 0
L-s%2 0 0 Ys

For a superluminal boost along z with speed vector parameter related to v by

0 10 =«~0
aa 0 O01 0 |
-y% 00 48

As already mentioned Ag exchanges timelike and spacelike vectors along the chosen axis, sending
a four vector 2 such that va, > 0 to a’! such that a’#a/, < 0.
The infinite-speed limit along z is the involution

0 00 -1
0 10 #0
Aoo(@=0.6=0 =|) 9 1 9
-1 00 0
The above matrix swaps the t- and z-axes and leaves the x- and y-axes fixed. By direct
computation we have, using [L0}
Ag(V) = Aoo(0,0)As(v) = As(v) Aco (0, 0) (22)

Let v,v’ be subluminal collinear parameters along direction z, with sum v” given by the 1D

Einstein velocity addition [7]. By and
As(V) As(V’) = As (v) Noo As(v') Noo = As(v) As(v’ ) A, =As(v"),
A.(v) " (V’) = Ag(v) As(v") Aono = As(V"),
As(V") As(u) = As(v’) Moo As(v) = As(v) As(v') oo = As(V"),

Including the element —J for group closure define

s:=A,(-), S:=As(-), —-s:=—As(-), —S:=—As(-),

which multiply as:

-S|-S -s §S

the block (s vs S) is determined by the parity of the number of S factors and the overall
sign multiplies. The above multiplication table has been derived for a given choice of 0,¢@ but
it holds true independently of this choice. Indeed for arbitrary values of 6,¢@ pick a spatial
rotation R(6,¢) € SO(3) such that R(6,¢)z = (sin @sin d, sin @ cos ¢, cos @) where z = (0,0, 1).
Define R := diag(1, R(O, ¢)) and

Ag(v’) = R,Ag(2 ) RT
As(V’) := R, As(V) R
(0, ¢) = RAW(0,0) R71.

Then all identities above are preserved under conjugation by R, yielding the multiplication table
for As(v’), As(V’), Aco(9,¢) for collinear boosts along sababtaty directions, where vectors v, V
and v’,V’ are related through v! = Ru, V’ = RV, |V| on \V’| ca

For boosts along different directions one recovers the usual Thomas precession [12]: the
product of two boosts (subluminal or superluminal) in different directions is a boost composed
with a spatial rotation R € SO(3) (see (2). We thus can drop the subluminal/superluminal

distinction and write a generic transformation in this group generalizing (2pas:

L(v, 0) = A(v)R(O) |v] ER, (23)

The matrix group defined is freely generated by multiplication of matrices H = SO(3, vt ;
Aco, -1. We indicate it as:
Leot= (Hy Noo —l) (24)

From a group theoretic perspective the extended Lorentz group defined in is a realization
of a semidirect product extension [9] of H = SO(3, ft via the Klein’s four group Z2 x Z2. In
appendix [A-Q] it is showed:

Lext = (SO(3,1)F “aay, Z2) x Zo, (25)

7
Where x Ad,,, denotes extension by semidirect product group where non trivial automorphism
Ada, denotes conjugation with A. and is composed with extension with the first Zz factor
while the other extension factor acts trivially at the conjugation class level.

The four connected components correspond to the four cosets SO(3, Yes Axo SO(3, Des
(-1SO(3, be, (—DAnwSO(3, oe and may be identified with labels in rows and columns of the
product table of extended group boosts above. A different A,.(6’,¢') produces an equivalent
extension as it is related to the one with A..(9,¢) by conjugation with an element of the group

(namely of the subgroup SO(3), ie. a spatial rotation).

3 Unitary Representations of Extended Poincaré Group

3.1 Extended Poincaré group

Let H = SO(3, 1)fs T =~ Rand Z = {1-1 Ac, Aco}. The extended Poincaré group is the
semidirect product

Pext = P x Bese = T x (H Ada. Z) (26)
with multiplication

(h,a)-(h',a’') = (hh', a+ha’),

where J & R‘ is translation group, h € Lext acts on T by the standard linear action on R‘.
With the subspace topology from GL(4,R) on Lext and the Euclidean topology on T we
have:

1. Lext is a locally compact, separable Lie group (closed in GL(4,R)).
2. T =R* is locally compact and separable.

Local compactness and separability of Pext are inherited from Lext and J as it is defined via
semidirect product extension from those subgroups. The ordinary Poincaré group is

Po:=TxH (27)

which is itself a locally compact and separable topological Lie group.
In appendix [A.3]it is showed that:

Pext = Po Ma Z (28)
where a is an automorphism of (h,a) € Pext defined by:
az(h,a) = (zhz7!, z-a), zEZ (29)

We will use this fact in next section to derive unitary irreducible representations of extended
Poincaré group.

3.2 Classification of UIRs and Relationship with Wigner’s Representations
Let N = Po = (T x SO(3,1)f), in (28). Define:
N = {Wigner’s UIRs of N} (30)

An element z € Z acts on N via automorphisms, namely its action on a given element n =
(h,a) € N with h € SO(3, ly of the Poincaré group:

n=z-n (31)
is such that it exists an automorphism of N, a(n) such that
n' = a,(n) (32)
where a, is defined in (29). This induces an action on the set of charachters (i.e. UIRs) of Po:
n(n) = a(a,(n)) Vn eN (33)

The set N is constituted by UIRs of Poincaré group which have been classified by Wigner in
(21). UIRs of Poincaré group are classified by the value of the four momentum vector p = py
together with the value of the invariant lenght |L, - p|? associated to the orbit

Op = {Ls- p\Ls € SO(3, 1)f} (34)

p is called the representative of the induced UIR of Poincaré group. Given choice of p, an
SO(3, Vy -orbit representative in Wigner’s classification, its invariant could be p“p, #4 0 or
p"py = 0. Choosing a non massless (pp, 4 0) representative p,, we have:

e Massive Representations: Unitary irreps of SO(3) for time-like orbits
Tihass = UIRs of { L € SO(3, VTL, =pv p'py >O0 po > O} (35)
Tmass >= UIRs of { L € SO(3,1F|Lopy = pv vp, >0 po < O} (36)

e Tachyonic Representations: Unitary irreps of SO(2,1) for space-like orbits

Tach >= UIRs of { L € SO(3, 1) Pl Lepy =p, p'p,<0 } (37)
Choosing a massless (p/p, = 0) we have

e Massless Representations: Unitary irreps of ISO(2) for light-like orbits

Tmassless = UIRs of { Le SO, 1)p |e = Pv aon = oO} (38)
Now, with reference to the action in define, given a representative 7 € N , its Z-orbit:
On = {zn | z€ Z} (39)

and the stabilizers
Zr ={z€Z | zn(n) =7(n)} (40)

where n is in N = Po.
We have two different possibilities [TS].
If Z, = {e} Va(n) € N with e identity element of 7 then 4 U(z) such that

U(z)m(n)U(z) = 2(z7!nz) Vz EZ (41)

and the UIRs of Po (namely the set N ) consist of UIRs of the extended group too. In this case
UIRs which are inequivalent as representations of Py become equivalent for P.x¢. This is due to
the fact that orbits of SO(3, vt in momentum space preserve pp, with its sign while in Lex¢
the sign can change.

If, on the contrary, Z, # {e} for some 7 then its elements may give rise to inequivalent
UIRs depending on the action of z € Z, on 7 € N.

In what follows we are going to specialize these considerations to UIRs of the extended group
corresponding to non-lightlike and lightlike orbits.
3.2.1 UIRs Corresponding to Non Lightlike Orbits

For a given choice of momentum p,,, the possible non-lightlike z-orbits of the extended group
are those with p“p, 4 0 and give rise to the following UIRs of the Poincaré group Po:

N= {ris Tmass> Tach } (42)

The stabilizers of the corresponding orbits in H, =e, € N and from (4i}we have:

U (Aco) thas ()U (Moo) * = Tihass (Moot AS) = Mach (43)
U (A-co) Mihass(72)U (Aco) = Tinass(A—con Aa },) = Tach (44)
U(-I)mihass(™)U (I) = mhass((—Dm(-D)) = tnass (45)

We thus have that the set of UIRs in is a set of equivalent irreducible representations of
the extended group and to fully specify the UIR we need to explicit the intertwiners above.

Let Us. be the unitary operator corresponding to U(A,.) in (43). We look for an operator
such that:

T.0 (a, h)UZ' = 0 (Awa, AnhAZ) (46)

Where U(a,h) with a € T and h € SO(3, oes is an operator representing an element in
Thass With representative po = (M,0,0,0). Define the section:

ki(p) € SO(3, DF ke(p)po = p (47)
and the corresponding Wigner rotation:
s(h,p) = ke(p)~thk, (hp) (48)

It can be easily verified that s applied to po gives po so s;(h,p) is in the (little) subgroup of
SO(3, 1); stabilizing po. The operator U(a,h) acts on wavefunctions as [20]:

U(a,h) : (p) > (O(a, h)](p) (49)

where 7 ;
(O(a, h)d](p) = e'”“U(s(h, p)) (hp) (50)
and U(s(h,p)) is in m5,., which is an UIR of the stabilizer SO(3). Let go = Az!po and define

mass
the section:

ks(Ax'p) = Axthe(p) (51)
and the corresponding Wigner rotation:

s(h,q) = ks(q)'hks(h7q) (52)

it can be verified that s(h,q) applied to qo = Az!po gives qo thus s(h, q) is in the stability group
of go. Moreover we have the relations:

(hq) = Aoos(AsohAZ!, p)AZ! (53)
Upon defining the action:
Too: h(p) > [Uo] (p) = U (Aco) (AXP) (54)
where U,, is the operator corresponding to U(A..) in we have:

[Coo (a, h)OXV\(p) = [UooU (a, h) l(a) (55)

10
where

$(q) = U(Aco (9) (56)
Then from the above equation and
(U (a, h)d](q) = e'*U(s(h, g))b(h-*q) (57)
Finally using
[C0 (a, h)O SZ! W\(p) = el? 2U (s(AoohAZ), p))h(Acoh™ AZ! p) (58)
Upon writing the following relations:
Astp-a=p- Moca Aooh™A5!p = (AZo) Ip (59)
we have :
[Tool (a, h)O SY] (p) = [T (Acca, MoohASs )V](p) (60)

which is (46). The only other constraint on U(A,.) is that its square be I. Thus we can set
U(Aco) = Litself and set:

Voot](p) = VASP) (61)
Following a similar reasoning for U(—I) and U(—I) we have:
[F(-D¥](v) = v(-P) (62)

where U(—J) =I. The induced UIR for non lightlike orbits is thus, given a representative p,
the set of equivalent UIRs in each occuring with multiplicity one (given that H,=e Vr),
the intertwiners U(A..) and U(—A.o) transform an element of an UIR of a positive massive
and negative massive representations into an elemnent of a tachyonic representation (see (3),
(44)) while U(—J) transforms an element of an UIR of a positive massive representation into
an element of an UIR of a negative massive representation (see (45)).

3.2.2 UIRs Corresponding to Lightlike Orbits

We now consider the lightlike z-orbit
Oo = {pER : p?=0} (63)

with the standard representative chosen as po = (w,w sin 6 cos ¢,w sin @ sin ¢, w cos @) for some
w > 0 and some (6,¢). Let ko(p) € SO(3, 1p be a section such that ko(p) po = p, and define
the corresponding Wigner element

so(h,p) = ko(p)* hko(h7*p) € ISO(2), (64)
the little group at po. The induced Poincaré action on wavefunctions w : Oo > Ho is
[U(a,h)b](p) = e!?* Ud so(h,p)) (hp), (65)

where Up(-) is a unitary representation of [SO(2) (helicity or continuous-spin [2]]).
Define the section ko:

ko(Avo(0,9)~'p) = Noo(0,¢)~* ko(p) ; (66)
which yields the analogous relation to for lightlike orbits:
s(Aco (9, 6)hA(8,4)~*, p) = Noo(8,0) 80(h, Moo (, 6) *p) Noo (0,0) *- (67)

11
Because A.o(0, ) is in the stability group of po we have that it gives rise to two inequivalent

representations of the little group [S'O(2). If we define the operators:
[U(Acc(4, 9) |(p) = Uo(Avo(4, 4) Y(AZ'P) (68)
[O(—Dv |e) = v(-P) (69)

and we use along with (Az!p)- a = p- (Axa) we obtain:

U (Aco (8, 6) (a,b) O (Aco (9,.))~* = U(Avo(9,9)a, Noo(O,0)RAco(8,0)*), (70)
U(-1)U(a,h)O(-1*_ = U( =a, (-Dh(-D~*). (71)
As in the massive case the only other constraint other than is that U2 = I. We thus
have that light-like orbits give rise to two inequivalent UIRs which depends on the action of
the operators +Up(A.(8,¢)) on the UIRs of the stability group of po which is [SO(2). The
exact form and dimensionality of this operator will depend on the class of massless representation

chosen (continuous class or helicity class). U(—JI) exchanges the future/past light cones, sending
an element of the UIR of representative with po > 0 to one with po < 0.

4 Extended Poincaré Algebra

4.1 Restriction of Extended UIRs to Poincaré UIRs

In previous section they have been characterized all possible UIRs of the extended Poincare
group. This classification differs from Wigner’s one of Poincaré group because:

e tachyonic and massive representations are inequivalent UIRs of Poincaré group and be-
come equivalent representations of the extended Poincaré group

e massless representation split into two inequivalent UIRs of the extended Poincaré group
yecause of the action of U(A(9, ¢)) on the representation space of the UIR corresponding
0 stabilizer subgroup (or little group) ISO(2) of Poincaré group.

The reason for this is that, as already mentioned at the end of section|3.2.1| homogenous part of
Poincaré group contains transformations which preserve Minkowski metric with its sign while for
extended group the sign can change (because of the action of A. on L € SO(3, vt ). This sign
change implies that homogeonous part of extended Poincaré group can send time-like momenta
four vectors into space-like ones and in this extended framework the distinction between space
coordinates and time coordinate is observer dependent. This dependency gives rise to new
representations of the wavefunctions for the enlarged group according to the principle that, given
W(p) a wavefunction and (h,a) € Pext, the corresponding element of a unitary representation
U(h, a) sends q(p) in

[O(h, a)b](p) =e” U(s(h, p) (hp) (72)
here U(s(h,p)) is a UIR of the stability group of the momentum representative choosen and
the latter wavefunction is a representation of y(p) in the reference frame obtained multiplying p
by h € Lex and thus an allowed state. The classification of possible quantum states according
to this framework results by restricting UIRs of the extended group to UIRs of Poincaré group.
This restricted representation in non massless case decomposes as:

where I ndyo* represents the restriction of a non massless UIR of the extended Poincaré group
Tnon ml) to a Poincaré group representation. For massless case:

where the definition a _ depends through parameter € on the action of the finite stabilizer
group Z, = {A(9, ¢), 1} of Z-orbits of massless Poincaré UIRs.

4.2 Infinitesimal Restricted UIRs and Extended Poincaré Algebra

For h = Tin we have - ;
[U (a, 1)y](p) = ew (p) (75)

Writing U(a,1) = exp(ia" P,,) and differentiating at a = 0 gives

5 UaDu|(p)|  =tppv(p) =1(Puh)(p), (76)
Oat" a=0
thus .
(Puth)(P) = Pu ¥(P) (77)
Starting from the induced action of the homogeneous Poincaré transformations,
[O(h)d](p) = U(s(h, p)) WR), (78)

where U(s(h,p)) represents the little-group action for the choosen momentum representative.
Let h(w) = exp(5 w!”myv) be an element of the Lorentz group near the identity, with

’ = —w" infinitesimal. We expand

wl!

O(h(w)) =1+ 5 wh My + O(w2), (79)

and determine Mw by differentiating with respect to wi”.
Differentiating gives

0

OwhY

aU (s(h(w),p))

Ow(h-"p)
Owe ,

OwhY (80)

(OCmw)yw to) = ( ) wtp) +O (a(h().2)
The first term in depends on the variation of the little-group operator U(s(h, p)) which
in turn depends on the representative po (massless, non massless). We define

. OU(s(h(w), P))
Cpr (p) = 4 aoe oo (81)
so that, to first order,
U(s(h(w),p)) =F Sat” Sap(p) + OW). (82)

The matrices U,,(p) act on the indices of the wavefunctions coming from UIRs of stability
group of momentum representative.

The second term in encodes the change of the argument h~!p. Using the infinitesimal
Lorentz action on a four—vector,

(hp)? = p? — 5 (mag-p)?, (Mp P)? = NP Pv — Ww? Pys (83)
we find
ont a)) - = ~ (Myv-P) aoe
= 5 (Pv Oy — Pp Ip WO) (84)
Substituting and into (80), and comparing with (79), we obtain
(Myth) (p) = 4 (Du Ope — Dv Ope (p) + Dpv(p) 0(p). (65)

13
Thus, for small wi”,

[OT h(w))w(p) = (14 St” My) 1p), (86)
with .
My = t(PuOpy — PvOpe) + Lpv(p) (87)

The Poincaré algebra is generated by the momentum operators P, and the Lorentz genera-
tors M,, and satisfy

[Moo,Pu] = i(upPo — NwoPp) , (89)
[My Myo! =i (pM NupMc + No Mp - two Myp) . (90)
The Pauli Lubanski vector is defined as
x 1 A, SR
W? = 5 eh¥P? PL Moo, (91)

where e#”P is the Levi-Civita symbol (with ¢?!?3 = +1 and metric n,,, = diag(—1,1,1,1)).
Using the algebra - (89). we compute:

(we, Al = set (Ps Palpe + P,[Mye, Pl)

a ES ES A
= ge" PB, (mpPs — ro Po) fs (92)

The two terms cancel because of the antisymmetry of e“”?? under p 4 9, so that
(Ww, P\] =0 (93)
This implies that all components of W* commute with all Py, and therefore the operators
CO1=P4P, Co=W*W,,

commute with each other and with all generators of the algebra. They are thus Casimir invari-
ants of the Poincaré algebra.

Because C; and C2 commute with all P,, one can find a common eigenspace of the repre-
sentation space spanned by wavefunctions w(p) which are simultaneous eigenfunctions of these
operators:

C(p) = M*d(p),— Ca(p) = ~M? Cine (P),; (94)

where Ciittle is the Casimir eigenvalue of the little group algebra depending on the representative
choosen (massless: two inequivalent UIRs of iso(2); non massless: three inequivalent UIRs, two
UIRs of s0(3) with po > 0 and po < 0 resepctively and_one UIR of so(2, 1) for tachyons).

Using the explicit form of the Lorentz generators (85) we can write WH as

WH = Let¥P? P, [i(ppOp7 — Po Ope) + Lpal - (95)

The first (orbital) part inside the brackets is proportional to ppps — PePp = 0, and therefore
vanishes identically. Hence,
WH = Sel? P, Dog. (96)

The six Lorentz generators are decomposed into spatial rotations J; and boosts K;:

Ji = § ijn Djs Kj = Xoi. (97)

14
Explicitng using (97) we get:
W® = PiXo3 + PoDgi + P3Ey2 = Py Jy + Po Jo + P3J3

W! = PoX23 + PoDgo + P3X02 = Poi — PoK3 + P3Ko,
W? = Podsi + P3X10 + PiXo3 = Poo — P3K1 + PiKs,
W? = Poin + PiD29 + PoE = Pods — Ppa + PK.

In compact vector form:
W=-PRJ-Px kK, W°=P.T.

(98)
(99)
(100)
(101)

(102)

where V = (Vi, V2, V3) identifies boosts and rotations generators and spatial part of momentum

four vector.

We now evaluate this invariant in standard representative frames for the different classes of
orbits. This gives rise to all possible quantum wave equations of the Extended Lorentz Group

defined in this work.

4.2.1 Massive Representations
Particles: p"p, >0, pp >0 P# =(M,0,0,0):
W°=0, W=MJ,
Ci = P#P, =—M?,
C2 = WYW,, = —M? | J)? = —MP?Cyo(3)-

where V = (Vi, Vo, Va), |J? = J? + J2 + J? is 50(3) Casimir operator and J; satisfy:
[Jas Jj] = teejeTes [Ki, Kj] = —teijn Je, [Ji, Ky] = teijn Kr.
and denotes generators of s0(3) algebra. The wave equations are
(PEP, + M?)y =0, (WHW, + M?s(s + Lp = 0.
where s(s + 1) denotes s0(3) Casimir eigenvalue.

Antiparticles: p“p, > 0, po <0 For P“ = (—M,0,0,0) one has

W# = (0,-MJ) C2 = —M? | J/?,

so the Casimir eigenvalues are identical; only the energy sign changes.
4.2.2 Tachyonic representations
Let fi = (n!,n?,n°) be a unit spatial vector parametrized by spherical angles
fh = (sin@ cos ¢, sin@sin¢d, cos 6).
We complete this to a right-handed orthonormal frame with
€; = (cos@ cos ¢, cos@sin dg, —sin 6), €) = (— sind, cos¢, 0),

so that (é1, €2,/) is orthonormal and é; x é2 = fi.
We define the following combinations of Lorentz generators:

Ry =h- J= nh +n do+n3 Jy

(108)

(109)
Bp =e: K =ctK, + Ko + 3K (110)
By =&-K =eK, +eKo+eKs (111)

It is showed in appendix [A-4] that the Poincaré algebra Casimir becomes
C2 = M?[-(Rn)* + Bi + BY] (112)

where we define the Casimir of s0(2,1) built from {R,, Bi, By} to be:

Cro(2,1) = Bi + B53 — Ri. (113)

therefore the Pauli Lubanski invariant of Poincaré algebra in the tachyonic representation is
directly related to the Casimir of so(2, 1):

C2 = —M? Cso2,1) (114)
while
Ci = M? (115)
The wave equations are
(PEP,— M?)p=0, 9 (W*W, + M?t(t+1))p =0. (116)

where t(t + 1) is the eigenvalue of C59(2,1) which is the Casimir operator of s0(2,1) algebra.

4.2.3. Massless Representations

Fix angles (6,¢@) and let
h = n(0,d) = (sin@cos¢, sin@sing, cos). (117)
Choose the massless momentum
Ph = (4, wh), wi 0, (118)

so phPoy = 0. The little group at po is ISO(2).
Complete fi to a right-handed orthonormal frame (é1, é2, ft):

€1 = (cos@ cos ¢, cos@sin dg, —sin@), €) = (— sind, cos¢, 0).

Define the following linear combinations of Lorentz generators:

Jy = fed, Ty := éy:(K+Ax J), a=1,2. (119)
In appendix [A.5] it is shown
(Un, Uh] = iIb, (Jn, Ile] = —7 Th, (Th, Iz] = 0, (120)

Using P# = Db = (w,wf) and the identities above one finds for the components of the
Pauli-Lubanski vector:

W =wi-J=wIn, (121)
W =u] J,@+Th é +1136). (122)

Since P? = 0 we have C) = P¥P, = 0. For Cp = W#W,:

Cy = —(W°)? + |W? = —w? J? +? (J? + 17 + TB) (123)

16
Hence
Co = w? (II? + 13) (124)

Thus C2 depends only on the two commuting generators IIq.

For a massless representation with little group JSO(2), the unitary operator U(A.) ex-
tending the representation to the enlarged Lorentz group must implement on the little-group
representation Up the automorphism of [SO(2) induced by Ada.,, namely

U(Aoo) Uo(s) U( Moo)? = Url Aco s AZ), 8 € ISO(2). (125)
The conjugation by Ag acts on the little algebra as:
U(Aco)JnU (Moo)! = Jn;  U(Aco) aU (Aw) =—Ta (a = 1,2).

Geometrically this is a consequence of the fact that Aso fixes the axis i and changes the signs
of parameters in the €;,2 directions.

Helicity representations In the helicity class of massless representations, the translation
generators II, act trivially on the little group UIR space V ~ C,

Uo(Ra) = eine Uo(Ta) =.
Hence the intertwining condition (125) is automatically satisfied for any scalar operator

U(Aws) = eT, e € {+1}, Use? Suk:

The two sign choices correspond to the two inequivalent one-dimensional characters of the Zz
generated by A. in the extended group.

Continuous-spin representations In the continuous-spin class, the [Ig act nontrivially,
and the operator U(A,,) cannot be proportional to the identity if it is to satisfy (125). Consider
the standard realization of Up on V = L?(R2) with continuous-spin parameter p > 0:

[Uo(Ta)f](€) =e" ** f(E), [Vol Ra) f](€) = f(R-of). (126)

Define the unitary reflection operator
ICFI(E) = F(—€). (127)

A direct computation gives:

CUo(Ta) Cf () = Cle? f(—€)) = e? ) f (€) = Uo(T-a) FQ), (128)
CUo(Ra) CF (€) = Of (R-a(-§))) = f(-R-o€) = f(R-o(-€)) = Uo(Ra)f(6)- (129)
Thus C realizes the required intertwining property (P25):

CUp(s)C™ =Up(AwsAx), 8 € E(2),
and satisfies C? = 1. Differentiating gives
C'dUo(Jn) C* = dUo(Jn), — C dUo(Ha) C~* = — dUo (Ha),
Therefore, for continuous-spin representations the appropriate choice is

U(Awo) = EC, e€ {+1}, (130)

where ¢ labels two inequivalent extensions of the [SO(2) representation, while C provides the
nontrivial reflection of the translation generators II, required by the automorphism Adj...

5 Tachyonic Representations and Parity Asymmetry in Elec-
troweak Decay

The asymmetric angular distribution of electrons observed in the celebrated experiment of C.S.
Wu [22] following the proposal of Lee and Yang [14] and its analysis by Jackson, Treiman,
and Wyld is conventionally interpreted as evidence of parity non-conservation in weak
interactions. Within the present framework, however, the same experimental pattern arises as
a purely kinematical consequence of the covariance properties of wavefunctions transforming
under unitary irreducible representations (UIRs) of the non-compact group SO(2, 1).

Let (9,¢) denote the spatial direction of the external magnetic field that defines the nu-
clear-spin quantization axis in the experiment. In the extended Poincaré framework developed
in previous sections, the momentum of a superluminal (tachyonic) decay product is obtained
from the timelike standard momentum pp = (M,0, 0,0) by the transformation q, = Aco (9, ¢)poy-
The subgroup of the Lorentz group leaving the direction (9,¢) invariant is isomorphic to
SO(2, 1); its UIRs therefore govern the internal degrees of freedom of tachyonic states.

Inverting the sign of magnetic field along (6,¢) corresponds to the following four vector
transformation:

B(0,sin 6 cos ¢, sin @ sin ¢, cos 6) —> B(0, sin(6 + 7) cos ¢, sin(@ + 7) sing, cos(8+7)) (131)

Assuming particles emitted in electroweak decay belong to tachyonic representations (section
|) and since

Aoo(t + 9, 6)p0 = — Aco(9,¢)po = —40 (182)

where po = (M,0,0,0), go is the momentum of the tachyonic particle emitted before the switch
and —qo is the momentum of the particle after the switch. The associated wavefunction comes
from an UIR of stability group SO(2,1) evaluated at space-like momenta q and is invariant
under transformation go — —qo; we thus conclude:

Wartter(g) = e™ Vefore(); xER, (183)

even though the four-momentum changes sign, Chter = —Ghefore so that the scalar B,gq" stays
invariant. In consequence of the emitted particle is seen propagating along the same
spatial direction before and after magnetic field reversal in laboratory frame, reproducing the
experimentally observed asymmetry

A= (Ny—M)/(Np+ Ny) 1 (134)

In this sense, what is conventionally called parity violation appears here as a manifestation of
the fact that spatial inversion is not represented by an inner automorphism of the non-compact
little group SO(2, 1).

UIRs of SO(2, 1) are conveniently realized as square~integrable functions on the two-sheeted

hyperboloid we - a? _ xe = 1, with coordinates

to = cosh p, 2x, = sinh pcos6, vq = sinh psin@.

In this model the Casimir operator acts as the Laplace operator, and the basis functions take
the form

Vm(p,9) = Rrm(p) ee”, = me Z, (135)

where R)m(p) are hypergeometric radial functions satisfying the eigenvalue equation C2 Vy» =
AW)m with A = t(t + 1) [0] (15) (19) (10) [2]. The integer m labels the eigenvalues of the compact
generator J3 = —idg (denoted Rp in {109)).

18
For small p (corresponding to low transverse momentum), the lowest harmonics m = 0,+1
dominate the expansion of the wavefunction, whereas higher |m| correspond to higher multipoles
suppressed in the decay amplitude. These first harmonics behave as

Vor Ro(p), War ~ Ri(p)e*,

where the hyperbolic radial functions satisfy Ry() o sinh p near the origin [19] 2}.
Writing the decay amplitude as the coherent superposition

A(0) = ao Ro(p) + a1 Ri(p) ec” + a_1 Ri(p)e®, (136)
and expanding to lowest order in sinh p, one finds for the differential counting rate
dN AR (apa RG R1)

— 6)|? ~ Ao [1 6], = oe 137
dQ “ |A( ) ol ay One I ° Jag Ro|? + 2\a, Ri |? ( )
Thus the interference between the isotropic (m = 0) and dipole (m = +1) components of the
SO(2, 1) wavefunction generates a linear cos 6 term in the emission probability,
dN
Secall «x 1+acosé, (138)

in quantitative agreement with the empirical law found in Refs. [22] [[3]. The emergence of
this term is a general feature of the discrete series representations of SO(2,1), whose angular
harmonics obey the addition theorem W,,(0)W,/(@) « cos[(m — m’)6], and hence naturally
reproduce first-order angular asymmetries [19] [2].

In a compact SO(3) representation parity requires the angular distribution to be an even
function of @, excluding linear cos 6 terms. For the non-compact SO(2, 1) symmetry appropriate
to tachyonic representations, no such constraint exists: inversion with respect to the quanti-
zation axis is not an inner operation of the little group, so that even and odd harmonics can
interfere. The observed parity asymmetry therefore emerges here not from an explicit violation
of Lorentz invariance, but from the intrinsic representation structure of the extended Lorentz
group, in which both ordinary and tachyonic sectors are unified.

Hence, within this group-theoretic framework, the characteristic cos @ angular dependence
of the emitted electrons is a direct signature of the SO(2,1) covariance of the decay wave-
function, and the so-called parity violation reflects the geometric properties of superluminal
representations rather than a fundamental asymmetry of the weak interaction.

6 Conclusions

In this article we have introduced and analysed a new framework for relativity and quantum field
theory, by extending the proper orthochronous Lorentz group to include superluminal transfor-
mations in arbitrary directions. The extended group Lext and its associated extended Poincaré
group Pex; remain locally compact and admit a well-defined induced representation theory. We
classified all unitary irreducible representations of P.x4 by adopting Mackey induction in the
presence of the discrete extension, and we showed how each such UIRs restricts to a direct sum
of standard Poincaré UIRs.

Next we derived the generator-form of the extended Poincaré algebra via differentiation of
the representation action, and we solved the Casimir eigenvalue problems to obtain wave equa-
tions. These include all familiar relativistic wave equations (Klein—Gordon, Dirac, Maxwell,
Poca, etc.) and in addition provide new wave-equations describing tachyonic representations
and a novel class of massless representations implied by the extension. Furthermore, we pro-
posed an interpretation of parity-asymmetric phenomena in electroweak decays through the
representation theory derived from this new framework in which SO(2,1) rather than usual
SO(3) is the group underlying symmetry of the wavefunctions, thereby providing a purely kine-
matical group-theoretic alternative to parity violation.

A Appendix
A.1 Proof of (19)

To establish the identity (r9), we verify the matrix equality component-wise, utilizing the sym-
metry properties of Lorentz boosts and the transformation rule (9), together with the identities
and (Ui). We begin by verifying the diagonal entries, followed by the off-diagonal ones.

Spatial Diagonal Elements (/,/), with | = 1,2,3

We aim to verify:

e (l,m) = (1,3): i=a2,j=2z,k=y

e (l,m) = (2,3): i=y,j7 =2,k=2

A.2 Proof of

First we provide a definition and few facts regarding semidirect product extensions for locally
compact group (see also [I]]).

Let H and Q be locally compact groups and let a : Q + Aut(H) be a continuous homomor-
phism. The semidirect product of H by Q with respect to a, denoted G = H xq Q, is the locally
compact group whose underlying manifold is H x Q with the product topology and group law

(Ax, q1)(h2, 2) = (Ai Og, (h2), 192); (150)

inverse
(h, qt = (ag-1(h7), q'), (151)
and identity element (ey, eq).
Then H is a closed normal subgroup of G, and the quotient G/H is isomorphic to Q. If Q
is finite, G is locally compact if and only if H is.
In order to prove let H := SO(3, vt and Q := Zy x Zp = {s,r| 5s? =r? =1, sr=rs}.
Define a homomorphism

a: Q—> Aut(H), a(s) = Adace| gy a(r) = idx.

Since A, =I and —I is central, a is well defined and a group homomorphism. The underlying
external product manifold H x Q inherits a semidirect product structure:

H ™_Q~ with multiplication (h,q)- (h',q') = (ha(q(h), aq’).
The matrix subgroup of GL4(R) defined in is canonically isomorphic to H =, Q via
®:H xa Q—Lext,  O(h,s°r®)=(—-D® ASA, ¢,6 € {0,1}.
Indeed the correspondence is surjiective since H = SO(3, 1); is normal in Lex; and —/ is central
while Ajo H. AS = H and every element of Lext lies in exactly one of the four cosets H, AwoH,
(-DH, (—I)AxH, hence has the form (—I)°A& jh. It is injective as different pairs (,6) land

in different cosets, so if ®(h, sc) = B(h!, s*'c") then (¢,5) = (e’,6’) and AS,h = AS h’, whence
h =h’. Moreover preserves group structure:

In particular,
Lext = (SO(3,1)F “aay, Z2) x Zo, (152)

because the r-factor represented by 6 in © acts trivially on SO(3, by ,

22
A.3 Proof of

Let Po = T = A with multiplication
(a, ho) - (a’, hg) = (a+ hoa’, hoho ).

Z acts on Py by automorphisms a, defined by

az(a’,ho) = (z-a’, zhoz”'), zZEZ.
Define
G,:=(T™ HA) x, Z, sae o ie aa
where the action of (ho, z) € H x Z ona’ € T is (ho, z)- a’ := ho (z-a’). Then

).
WwW: Gio G, W(((a, ho), 2)) == (a, (ho, 2))

is a group isomorphism.
Indeed in G, the product is

((a, ho), 2) ((a’, ho), 2’) = ((a, ho) -az(a’, ho), 22’) = ((a+ho(=a'), ho(zhpz7')), z2'). (153)

In G2 the product is

(a, (ho, z)): (a’, (ho, 2’) = (a+ (ho, z)-a’, (ho, z)(ho, z')) = (a+ ho(z') ; (ho(zhoz71), zz).
(154)

Apply W to the product in G1:
w(((a +ho(z-a’), ho(zhoz7')), z2')) = (a +ho(z-a’), (ho(zhoz—'), z2)) (155)

which is exactly the product (154) in G2 of W((a,ho),z) and U((a’,hG), 2’). Hence W is a
homomorphism.
The inverse map is

wl: GG, w(a, (Ao, 2)) = ((a, ho), 2),
which is clearly two-sided inverse to V. Therefore V is an isomorphism.

A.4 Proof of

From the operators defined in (109)-(111), using the Lorentz commutation relations, one com-
putes:

[Rn, Bi] = (ax @1)- K = Bo (156)
[Rn, Bo] = (ax &)- K =—By (157)
[Bi, Bo] = —(@) x &) - J = —Rn (158)

which is isomorphic to s0(2,1). Now let:
Qh = Anh Pp = (0, M sin @ cos ¢, M sin @ sin 4, M cos @) = (0, Mi) (159)
Explicit computation of the Pauli Lubanski vector components in (98) gives:
Wo = QI + QJ + QI =A F= Rn,
WI =Q?K3-Q?ko, = W? = Q3K,-Q'K3, — W8 = Q' Ky - Q°K,.

23
Equivalently,
W=QxK=nx Kk.

The Poincaré Casimir is

Co = W*W, = —(W°)? + (W1)? + (W?)? + (W)?,
From the above components,

and

(W!)? + (W?)? + (W)? = |ax KP =|KP - (aK)?

Decomposing K into components along (é1, €2, ?),
K = Bye, + Boe + (A- KYA

we find
|K|? — (aK)? = B2 + BB
Thus:
C2 = M?[-(Rn)? + Bi + BY]

A.5 Proof of

Let
nh = (sin@cos¢, sin@sin@, cos @)

be a unit spatial vector, and let (€1,é2,%) be a right-handed orthonormal triad satisfying
é, X €g =". We define the following combinations of Lorentz generators:

In =v, Thy = é.:(K+Ax J), a=1,2. (160)
We use the vector form of the Lorentz algebra (with h = 1):
[J-u, J-v] =iJ-(ux v), [J-u, K-v] =i K-(ux v), [K-u, Kv] =—-iJ-(ux v), (161)

for all u,v € R3.
We also introduce the transverse-plane conventions

a2 = +1, AX €g = €ab Cb, €a X €b = Ea hr,

which hold for any orthonormal triad.

From and (tip,
[Jn Ha] = [Jeti K-ég] + [J-n, (he x &a)]
=iK-(Ax éq) +iJ- (A x (x Eq). (162)
Since fh x €q = €apép and fi xX (A X Eg) = Eqy(f X Ep), we obtain
[Jn, Ua] = i egy Ke + egy T(x 6p) = Gegy Ty. (163)

Hence

Expanding the definition (160),

24
Each term can be evaluated using (161):

[K-é, J-(A x é)] = —i K-((f x &g) x €1) =0 (165)
[J- (A x é1), K-é)] =i K-((f x 1) x é2) =0, (166)
[J-(A x &), J(A x &g)] =i I-((A x €1) x (AX &g)) = HIT A=+HiTn. (167)

Summing all contributions, we find
(Th, Wo] = (—iJp) +0404 (+i Jn) =0.
The commutation relations of the set {J,,, Ih, Ij} are therefore
[Jn Wi] = iT, [Jn Ha] = —ith, (Hi, Ily] = 0, (168)

which coincide with those of the Euclidean algebra iso(2).
