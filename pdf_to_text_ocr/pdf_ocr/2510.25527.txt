We show that by embedding liquid-filled acoustofluidic cavities in a metamaterial, the quality
factor of the cavity at selected acoustic resonance modes can be enhanced by 2 to 3 orders of mag-
nitude relative to a comparable conventional cavity by matching the coarse-grained elastic moduli
of the metamaterial to the acoustic properties of the liquid.

I. INTRODUCTION

The quality factor Q of an acoustic resonance mode ina
liquid-filled acoustofluidic cavity embedded in an elastic
solid is limited by the dissipation in the liquid, mainly
due to the large stresses in the thin viscous boundary
layers near the elastic walls of the cavity. For MHz ultra-
sound resonance modes in typical water-filled acoustoflu-
idic cavities with kinematic viscosity v at angular fre-
quency w, @-factors are often in the range 10 - 500 [1],
a value set by the relevant length scale of the cavity rel-
ative to the thickness 6 = "Ea of the viscous boundary
layer [2]. For a long straight box-shaped cavity of length
L, width W, and height H, with H <W < L, it is found
that Q = 4. Given a typical height H = 160 pm and
a standing half-wave along the width W = 375 pm with
a resonance frequency of 2 MHz, we have the boundary-
layer width 6 = 0.4 pm, and thus Q = 400.

In the above example, the boundary layer is formed by
the viscous friction in the liquid, as the acoustic velocity
of the liquid is changing from its bulk value v1 to zero
at the nearly rigid wall over a distance of 6. The small-
ness of 6 is the reason that the dissipation Wer ~ n(2t)?
in the boundary layer dominates the total dissipation in
the system. The Q-factor may be increased considerably
simply by removing the boundary layer. In this paper we
show that the boundary layer may be removed or at least
strongly suppressed by embedding the acoustic cavity not
in a conventional elastic solid, denoted by superscript
*sI”, but instead in an elastic metamaterial denoted by
superscript ”"mm”. By tuning the coarse-grained elastic
moduli of the metamaterial, it is possible at a given reso-
nance to match at the solid-liquid interface of the cavity
the vibrational velocity O,u of the metamaterial to the
acoustic velocity v; of the liquid. This matching will
suppress the boundary layer, and the dissipation of the
system will then be limited by the small bulk dissipation
of the liquid, and the Q-factor increases by a factor 200
to ~ 10°.

The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we present

the theory of acoustic cavities embedded in an elastic
metamaterial. In Sec. III we introduce a specific two-
dimensional (2D) model, which is simulated numerically
in Sec. IV, using the finite-element software COMSOL
Multiphysics, as well as analytically for a simplified case.
Finally, in Secs. V and VI we discuss the results and
present our conclusions and outlook. Animations of se-
lected results are provided in the Supplemental Mate-
rial [3].

II. THEORY
A. The 2D model system

Our proposed system is assumed to be translational in-
variant in the length direction L and with the rectangular
cross section sketched in Fig. 1. In this cross section a
fluid-filled cavity 0 circumscribing a rectangle of width
W® and height H® is surrounded by a solid material re-
gion 9°! which is subdivided into four domains. The base
Of... is a large rectangular block of regular solid mate-
rial of width W*! and height H*! and with a free surface
to the left. The lid Of, is a thin rectangular region of
regular solid material of width fn with a prescribed
time-harmonic displacement w?Y* = do cos(wt) ey on its

rightmost boundary. The remaining two rectangular re-
gions OU" and OF,» above and below the cavity con-
sist of a mechanical metamaterial, where the small-scale
geometry has been optimized such as to make the meta-
material move in sync with the fluid in the cavity. We
treat all acoustic fields gi to be complex-valued with a
harmonic time dependence e~‘”*, such that the real part
corresponds to the true physical field g?¥s,

gP9(r,t) = Re[gi(r) e-"). (1)

B. The fluid domain

To model the acoustic behavior of the coupled fluid-
solid system, we first consider the governing equations in
the fluid domain 0" in terms of the pressure p, velocity v,
and density p", namely the continuity and Navier-Stokes
equation,

ap" = -V -(p*v), (2a)
paw =V-o"— (p!u-V)v, (2b)
fl

where the fluid stress tensor o" is given in terms of p, v,
and the respective shear and bulk viscosity 7 and n>,

of = [—pt(n? — 2n)V-v]L4+n[Vv + (Vv)"]. (3)

At the fluid-solid interface, which is the boundary 00" of
the fluid domain 04 with normal vector n, the boundary
conditions are continuity in velocity and normal stress,

v=d0u, at ani, (4a)
oa! .n=o-n, at an, (4b)

where o*! and 0;u is the stress and velocity of the ma-
erial surrounding the fluid domain. We solve the above
equations by applying perturbation theory in terms of
he acoustic Mach number assuming fields to become
rogressively weaker with increasing orders. For the
zeroth-order solution, we assume the fluid to be at rest
vo = 0 with constant pressure po and density pf. We
hen assume the first-order fields to be time-harmonic,
gi = g(r) e~!, and relate the first-order pressure and
density, pi(r) = cZ pt, by assuming a constant com-
ressibility x = [pf(cf)?]~”, where cf is the speed of
sound. Finally, we truncate the perturbation expansion
and keep only zeroth-, first-, and time-averaged second-
order fields,

p" (r,t) = pa + poxpi(r) e+ p3(r), (5a)

p(r,t) = po + pi(r) e+ po(r), (5b)

v(r,t) = u(r) e#! + vo(r). (5c)

Inserting this expansion into Eq. (2), we obtain the first-
order governing equations,

iwnip, =V-01, (6a)

iwpte, = Vpr — V0. — (n> - an) V(V -v1), (6b)

which we solve numerically, and which we work with an-
alytically moving forward.

Numerically, we also solve for the second-order fields
in 2", which are governed by the equations [2],

PIV vw +V- (piv) =0, no, (7a)
V of — iV -(viv1) =0, in OF, (7b)
v2 + ((u1-V)v1) =0, at a", (7c)

where the bracket (A, By) represents the time average
over one oscillation period of the product of any two
complex-valued first-order fields A; and Bj,

(AvB1) = 5 Re [A.Bi], (8)

with the asterisk being the complex conjugate.

To characterize the utility of acoustic modes with re-
gard to focusing microparticles by acoustophoresis, we
calculate for each mode three useful quantities: The time-
averaged acoustic energy density E{. in the fluid,

and the spatial average ((v2)) of the magnitude of the
streaming velocity v2,

(a) = 5a f, lol av. (90)

If we imagine placing a spherical particle with radius
a inside an acoustic cavity, the particle is subject to an
acoustic radiation force Fyaq ~ ab ki pa pushing it to-
wards the nearest pressure node (or anti-node) [4-6]. Si-
multaneously, a drag force Farag ~ 62aNv2 associated
with the acoustic streaming field v2 will tend to instead
pull this particle around in a vortex motion. Conse-

quently, there exists a critical radius ag ~ 64/ v2 /ur*y!,
for which Farag ~ Fraa, and below which particle focus-
ing ceases. For polystyrene particles in a the box-shaped
2-MHz cavity described in the introduction, this radius
is roughly a. ~ 1 pm [7, 8]. For strong focusing of small
particles one therefore needs E"., to be as high as possible
while keeping the streaming field v2 as low as possible.

C. The solid domains

In the solid domains, we apply linear elastodynamics
to solve for the displacement field u(r,t), such that the
strain is s = $(Vu+(Vu)") and the Hookean stress o*!
in terms of the stiffness tensor C is linear in s,

o = C38 = Ci Sq (10)
FIG. 2. The geometry of the simulated device with two (Ny, x
N.) = (4 x 8) metamaterial arrays of elongated hexagonal
unit cells on either side of the fluid channel. The device is
actuated on the outer right-most surface (green line) with a
time-harmonic uniform displacement amplitude of do (green
arrows), while all other walls are free to move having zero-
stress conditions.

The second equality employs index-notation, where sum-
mation over repeated indices is implied. For isotropic
materials, C can be written in terms of the Voigt coeffi-
cients C,, and Cy, as

C ijn (Cyy = 2044) ij bet + Cyy (Sind ju + Fudjx). (11)

Consequently, the governing equation for the time-
harmonic displacement field uw of the elastic solid is the
Cauchy momentum equation,

u(r, t) = u(r) e-™,

On the boundary of the solid domain, three types
of boundary conditions apply: (1) continuity of veloc-
ity on the fluid-solid boundaries 0", which supplement
the continuity of stress Eq. (4b), (2) a prescribed time-
harmonic displacement with amplitude dp on the actu-
ated part O84, of the outer boundary, and (3) zero stress

D. The metamaterial domains

The metamaterial domains consist of N,x.N,-arrays of
the elongated hexagonal unit cell specified in Fig. 2 and
Table I. Like the regular solid domains, the metamaterial
domains are governed by the Cauchy equation. In a full
numerical model this is implemented straightforwardly.
However, when making analytical coarse-grained approx-
imations, we describe a given metamaterial as a homo-
geneous anisotropic elastic solid governed by the Cauchy
equation with effective values (superscript ’mm/’) of the
mechanical fields, such as C > C™™ and u > u™™,
Most of the effective quantities are assumed to be local
spatial average values of their exact counterparts with
the single exception of C™™, which instead is defined
100 pm

Ill. MODELLING THE SYSTEM
A. Materials and geometry of the model

The model to be simulated numerically is defined as
follows: The solid material is chosen to be fused silica
glass due to its small attenuation constant, the fluid is
water, and all parameter values are listed in Table I.
The detailed cross-sectional geometry in the y-z plane
is shown in Fig. 2, and the model is assumed to be trans-
ational invariant in the out-of-plane x-direction. Note
in particular the elongated hexagonal unit cells inspired
y Ref. [11], which initial configuration has been cho-
sen to satisfy all the requirements for the course-grained
elasticity and density derived later in this section. The
design goal of the geometry is to support the first acous-
ic mode n = 1, i.e. a standing half-wave resonance inside
he rectangular fluid channel with a pressure node along
he line y = 0, and subsequently to fine-tune this mode
© maximize its Q-factor Q;. The obtained systems are
hen compared against a conventional reference system,
where the metamaterial domains are replaced by solid
glass.

B. Implementation in COMSOL

The governing equations and boundary conditions of
Sec. II are, as in our previous work [2, 5-7], implemented
in the “Weak Form PDE Interface” of the commercial
finite-element software COMSOL Multiphysics [12]. Ex-
amples of numerical solutions are shown in Fig. 3 for
both a conventional rectangular fluid-filled channel em-
bedded in an ordinary elastic solid and for a model with
metamaterial.

C. An approximate analytical solution

As stated earlier, the goal of this paper is to create
an acoustofluidic mode without viscous boundary layers
so that vj is irrotational [2]. In this case, the first-order
governing equations reduce to a Helmholtz equation for
pi, while the velocity field v; is proportional to Vpi,

where 74 = wafl(n>+ $7) is the dimensionless bulk damp-
ing coefficient of the fluid, which for MHz-frequencies in
water is of order 10-5. A mode is thus synchronized with
the wall motion, if this curl-free bulk velocity along the
entire boundary of the fluid domain satisfies the no-slip
condition (4a), which in terms of p, is

This condition gives us a strong hint about how to con-
struct a cavity with a wall-synchronized resonance mode.

Finally, one way to ensure that the displacement field uw

assume that wu; takes the form of a standing longitudinal

In the limit where the lid thickness we, tends to zero,

and the device height H*! tends to infinity, this system

has a near-perfectly synchronized resonance mode at fre-
quency f = cf / W*. In the following section we show
that even in the case of a geometry with finite values of
we and H*!, the above conditions serve as en excellent
starting point for numerical determination of metamate-
rials that support well-synchronized modes.

IV. NUMERICAL SIMULATION

We now present the main result of our work: the op-
timization of the metamaterial unit cell to maximize the
Q value of the acoustic cavity.

is divided into two steps. First, we find a metama-
terial which satisfies the three criteria listed in Eq. (23).
For this, we opted for a hexagonal metamaterial, which
has shown high tuneability in previous work [11], and
which due to its twofold mirror-symmetry already satis-
fies the criteria CHM, = Cyyyyoiy and CR, = Ciyydiz-

By simulation in COMSOL Multiphysics of one unit cell
in the metamaterial, we calculate the course-grained stiff-
ness tensor C™™"(L,, Lz, L3) and manually adjust the pa-
rameters L,, L2, and L3 defined in Fig. 2 until Eq. (23)
is satisfied exactly. In our case with fused silica, this step

The second step in the optimization procedure involves
simulating the full system repeatedly using the built-in
COMSOL “Optimization Interface”. Starting with
the parameters found in the first step, and then for each
simulation changing the height ZL, and the hole-width Lo,
the Q-factor of the resonance mode is maximized. The
resulting set of optimized values of Li and Lz are listed
in Table II.

B. Energy density and Q-factor

In Fig. 3, the conventional reference cavity is compared
to the optimized metamaterial cavity with (Ny x Nz) =
(5 x 10) unit cells. For the conventional cavity, the ve-
locity amplitude of the acoustic mode in the bulk of the
cavity away from the boundary layers is far greater than
the wall velocity, leading to large velocity gradients inside
the boundary layers near the fluid-solid interface. These
gradients are far smaller inside the optimized metamate-
rial cavity, because there the first-order displacements uw;
and iw~!v; are synchronized across the interface. This
difference has a considerable effect on the Q-factor of the
mode, which in the following is always the n = 1 mode,
so henceforth we drop the mode index: The conventional
cavity has Q = 432, whereas the optimized (5 x 10)-
metamaterial cavity has Q = 1.04 x 10°, which is nearly
250 times greater.

In Fig. 4(a) the acoustic energy density E", and the Q-
factor of the optimized systems are plotted against the

number of unit cells Ny across the channel. For N, = 2
the optimized systems already outperform the reference
system for both metrics, and these performance metrics
increase monotonically with N,. For Q, this relationship
is initially linear, whereas E, grows quadratically. At
higher values of N,, these increases taper off.

To illustrate the sensitivity of the optimized resonance
modes to the geometry parameters, we show in Fig. 4(b)
how the Q-factor of the (5 x 10)-metamaterial cavity
mode drops when L,, L2, and L3 deviate from their op-
timized values. The greatest relative sensitivity is asso-
ciated with L,, where a 1.7% deviation from optimum
(1.5 pm away from 86.3 pm) halves the Q-factor of the
cavity. The greatest absolute sensitivity is however due
to L3, where a change of only 0.5 pm away from the
13.58 pm optimum halves the Q-factor of the cavity.

C. Streaming

To better understand the usefulness of the synchro-
nized metamaterial cavities for doing acoustophoresis, we
study the acoustic streaming field v2, as this will put a
lower bound on the size of the particles that can be fo-
cused inside the cavity. For this reason, the streaming
field of the optimized (N, x Nz) = (5 x 10) metamaterial
cavity is compared to that of the reference cavity. On
one hand, one would expect the synchronized cavity to
produce less streaming than the reference cavity, since its
boundary layers are considerably weaker. On the other
hand, the many corners along the fluid-solid interface of
the synchronized cavity tend to amplify the streaming
[13]. That the former effect dominates is revealed by
Table I, where it is seen that the normalized streaming
((v2)) op?! is monotonically suppressed (nearly « N+)
by more than an order of magnitude when going from
the reference cavity up to the (N, x Nz) = (10 x 20) syn-
chronized metamaterial cavity. Such a 10-fold reduction
in the streaming speed implies a //10-fold decrease in
the critical radius a, from ~ 1 pm to ~ 0.3 pm, allowing
significantly smaller particles to be focused.

We note in Fig. 5 that the streaming field of the syn-
chronized metamaterial cavity is not only quantitatively,
but also qualitatively different from that in the refer-
ence cavity. Whereas the streaming field in the reference
cavity is dominated by the conventional four large rolls
filling up the entire cross section, the streaming field in
the synchronized cavity instead contains many smaller
streaming vortices of various shapes and sizes, resulting
in a less uniform streaming pattern, but clearly with more
suppression of the streaming ((v2)) ~ Awe ‘ayl in the mid-
dle third of the channel, —},H" <z< zH4, such that a,

D. Particle focusing

A remarkable addition to the discussion of the critical
particle size a, is that Table II reveals how the fluid pres-
sure field p?” in the synchronized metamaterial device
scales with pi! of the reference device and the Q-factors,
pem ~ (gmm/Qgref) pte! This relation implies that the
acoustic radiation force F'*¢ on a suspended particle is a
factor (Q™™/Qre!)? ~ 4 x 104 larger in the synchronized
device than in the reference device for the same actuation

amplitude. Consequently, the focusing time T « ee

[14], or 7™™ x (&=) er is 4x 10+ times faster in
the former device than in the latter for a given particle
size. Alternatively, a particle two orders of magnitude
smaller, a™™ ~ 0.01a' will focus at the same time in
the metamaterial device as a'*' will do in the reference

device at the same actuation amplitude.

vice even on the long time scale of 25,000 ms, the 250-

US +9UZ,

In Table IT we see that the highly resolved cavities tend
to approach this theoretical upper bound quite nicely,
and we may thus conclude that this synchronization man-
ages to remove the dissipation associated with the viscous
boundary layers rather reliably.

Looking ahead, if we were to speculate how one may
reduce this dissipation even further and thus obtain still
higher Q-factors, theoretically it should be possible to
construct acoustic modes in such a way that the fluid
contains less than a half-wave across the channel at res-
onance, but still contains a pressure node. This would
greatly lower the bulk dissipation within the fluid.

We note that the proposed cavities have a harder time
suppressing the streaming velocities compared to how
easily Q-factors are raised. As mentioned earlier, we at-
tribute this to be caused by the many corners around the
fluid channel [13], even though these corners have been
rounded a bit to avoid generating too much streaming.
One may also attempt to construct a cavity with fewer
convex corners, or apply one of the methods proposed
for suppression of acoustic streaming in previous work
[5, 16, 17]. Clearly, there are many ways to suppress the
remaining streaming further.

With regard to how such synchronized cavities might
be fabricated, one possibility is to rely on drawing tow-
ers such as the ones used for the fabrication of photonic
crystal optical fibers. We note that such drawing towers
already are designed to shape fused silica glass with a fea-
ture length scale lower than the length scales considered
in this work [18]. Another possibility is to employ two-
photon 3D-printing and fabricate the metamaterial struc-
ture directly, a possibility that has been demonstrated

VI. CONCLUSION

By using metamaterials in acoustofluidic systems, it is
possible to reduce the acoustic boundary layers dramat-
ically by synchronizing the motion of the fluid to that

viscous friction near the fluid-solid interface, and it may
also, but to a lesser extent, reduce the acoustic stream-
ing. This technique of using acoustic metamaterials to
remove viscous friction could help increase Q-factors in a
wider range of microelectromechanical systems. Specif-
ically for acoustophoretic focusing of particles, synchro-
nized metamaterial cavities may lead to faster focusing
of smaller submicron particles compared to the current
state-of-the-art of using cavities in conventional materi-
