Abstract

We review major achievements in our understanding of multiphase coronal
plasma, where cool-dense and hot-tenuous matter coexists, brought about by
advances in modeling and theory, inspired by observations. We give an overview
of models that self-consistently form solar (or stellar) prominences and filaments,
or (postflare) coronal rain, and clarify how these different phenomena share a
common physical origin, relating radiative losses and coronal heating. While
we do not fully understand the coronal heating, multi-dimensional models of
solar prominence and rain formation demonstrate how thermal instability trig-
gers condensations, and how their morphology may reveal aspects of the applied
heating at play. We emphasize how the many pathways to linear instability
due to combined ingredients of heat-loss, gravity, flows, and magnetic topologies
are all involved in the resulting nonlinear magnetohydrodynamics. We provide
some challenges to future model efforts, especially concerning prominence fine
structure, internal dynamics, and their overall lifecycle.

1 Coronal cooling: multiphase galore!

Although coronal heating, implied by million degree plasma found throughout the solar
atmosphere, receives much attention, an equally daunting mystery relates to coronal
cooling. Cool material with temperatures down to about 10,000 K happily co-exists
with the hot surroundings, as especially evident in mature and long-lived prominences.
In energetic extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) or X-ray waveband views, the clear magnetic
structuring of the hot corona stands out, with distinct coronal loops and arcades that
show variability in all spatial and temporal scales covered by observations. Even though
solar physicists agree on a clear role for magnetically aided transport and dissipation
of energy into the corona, multiple proxies for chromospheric activity fail to provide
a clear correlation between loop brightness and estimated footpoint Poynting fluxes
(Judge and Kuin 2024): only a fraction of all field lines showing significant flux become
loaded with hot matter into prominent EUV loops. Furthermore, many of these hot
loops show multiphase fine structure: coronal rain blobs down to a few 100 km in width
across the assumed magnetic field orientation have been detected and studied statisti-
cally (Antolin et al. 2015). Coronal rain is found throughout active region loops (Sahin
et al. 2023), is linked to EUV-inferred periodicity of a few hours or longer detected
in hot loops (Auchére et al. 2018), and may be much more common than our current:
detection limits allow us to probe. From the thermodynamic viewpoint, prominences
and coronal rain blobs show striking similarities in the sense that both imply hundred-
fold contrasts in density and temperature, surviving whatever heating mechanism is
at play in the corona. Perhaps the most tantalizing manifestation of this multiphase
corona - meaning that both cold and hot matter are found in close proximity in the
same magnetic topology - is the occurrence of postflare coronal rain. Especially more
energetic flares of classes M and X demonstrate catastrophically cooled matter rain-
ing down loops that only seconds to minutes ago were heated above 10 million degrees
(Mason and Kniezewski 2022). As pointed out by Antolin (2020), this omnipresence
of multiphase matter in the corona may well be the key to advance our understand-
ing of coronal heating mechanisms. From the modeling perspective, the intricate link
between coronal heating and cooling has been explored in idealized settings that grad-
ually progressed from one-dimensional (1D) loops to fully three-dimensional (3D)
settings. Especially these model-based findings will be reviewed here, with an empha-
sis on how mass and energy circulations occur in realistically stratified atmospheres
and loops and what governs the formation of cool condensations. Depending on the
magnetic topology where modeled condensations form, they may grow and collect into
mature prominences, or show purely rain, or prominence-rain hybrids. In fact, Mason
et al. (2019) discovered that coronal rain easily develops near null point topologies,
as found in a location where an extended (~ 100 Mm) bipolar region was embedded
in more unipolar surroundings. Prominence-rain hybrids are indeed found near nulls,
and can show complex-shaped spider prominences resting in sagged field lines above
the null, with rain events on widely separated loops (Filippov 2023). These findings
challenge traditional views on prominences, such as those reviewed in Martin (1998).
This review deliberately mixes filament and prominence with coronal rain research,
as it tries to unify views related to small-scale and large-scale coronal condensations,
especially concerning their in-situ formation.

2 Filaments and prominences: related reviews

(at left, in emission above the limb) versus a clear filament view (at right). Figure credit: Yiwei Ni
(Nanjing University).

Large-scale coronal condensations known as filaments (when seen on disk) or
rominences (viewed at the limb) have been inferred from ancient descriptions', and
spectacular views exist on erupting prominences, like the Grand Daddy eruption from
946 captured? in Ha. Examples of such wavelength-specific views on prominences and
filaments by the CHASE mission (Li et al. 2022a) are shown in Fig. 1. Their location
with respect to active regions introduces the “active region”, “intermediate” or “quies-
cent” prominence terminology, which essentially distinguishes prominences occurring
into strong and complex field topology, versus weaker and mostly dipolar magnetic
field regions. Obviously, this local magnetic field complexity determines their internal
dynamics, as well as their longevity and likelihood to erupt. Quiescent (long-lived)
rominences are found above polarity inversion lines (PILs) at higher solar latitudes,
and polar crown prominences may even encircle the Sun’s pole entirely. The paper by
Hirayama, (1985) provides an early review, while a living review by Parenti (2014) doc-
uments especially the observational characterization of prominence properties. Several
- still open - questions relate to their 3D structure in both the magnetic and ther-
modynamic sense. This 3D structure connects across the different atmospheric layers:
rom the photosphere, where we know the magnetic fields, to the coronal embedding.
A more theory-based view was presented in Keppens et al. (2013), at a time when
multi-dimensional prominence formation models started to gain momentum. Other
reviews dedicated to prominence physics highlight

3 Prelude: force-balance aspects

3.1 Considerations from Newton’s law

Noting that prominences can be surprisingly long-lived structures (months for qui-
escent prominences), their large-scale configuration must somehow involve a robust
balance of forces. The same can be said for the hot coronal loops that may feature

a
occasional or even cyclic small-scale coronal rain. As an MHD description of the coro-
nal plasma is perfectly appropriate for all observable scales (ion gyroradii in a coronal
loop are in the cm range, while observations probe at best 10-100 km), the equation
of motion writes generally as

L
p(iv+v- Vv) =—Vp+ pg 4 in (V x B) x B+ Fyise , (1)
0

where density p, pressure p, velocity vector v, magnetic field vector B are the relevant
physical variables (8 scalars in total for a full 3D scenario), the external (spatially
varying) gravitational acceleration is g, the constant jo is the permeability, and a
further ‘viscous’ force Fyisc is listed that normally scales with (second order) velocity
gradients. Ignoring the fact that all prominences show internal motions and temporal
variability, long-lived large-scale structures must be aware of the force equilibrium
denoted by

0=—-Vp+pg+IxB. (2)
The Lorentz force uses the current density vector J = (V x B) /j19, and a magnetic
field with a vanishing current density vector J = 0 is called a potential field. If we
focus attention to a single hot coronal loop as detected in an EUV observation, and
assume that the loop is actually tracing the overall magnetic field line shape, the loop
obeys the projected hydrostatic balance

0=—b- Vp + pgj, (3)

where the unit field line vector b = B /|B| also enters the field-aligned gravity compo-
nent gj = b-g. If we instead focus on the full vectorial expression (2), and assess how
this force balance can be achieved within a given 3D volume of the solar corona, we
realize that the entire magnetic field topology, as well as the possible presence of (vol-
ume, surface or line concentrated) currents will play a key role. Two of the first models
relevant for the force equilibrium of prominences simplify the 3D problem posed by
Eq. (2) by assuming that everything is invariant along the filament axis. Both models
then concentrate on 2D force balance in a vertical (y, z) plane across the filament axis
(along x), and proceed as follows:

¢ Kuperus and Raadu (1974) consider the magnetic topology induced by a line current
above (and its mirror line current below) the photosphere: the non-force-free (i.e.
J x B £0) magnetic field near the line gives an upward force due to an azimuthal
field By, around the filament, which can balance the gravitational pull.

¢ Kippenhahn and Schliiter (1957) work from the full force-balance equation (2),
adopt invariance in height z, isothermal conditions, and reduce the problem to the
notion that upward-oriented, height-self-similar dips in field lines can locally balance
gravity with the then upward Lorentz force. This model does account for prominence
matter weighing down field lines.

Selected examples that go beyond these pioneering models are
© Petrie et al. (2007) provides full magnetohydrostatic solutions of Eq. (2) for the
gravitationally stratified bulk equilibrium of a cool and dense prominence plasma
embedded in a near-potential coronal field. The magnetic structure is still adopted as
invariant along the filament axis x (0, = 0 i.e. 2.5D), but magnetic fields have three
components B = (f(y, z),0:U(y, z), -OyV(y, z)). This introduces the flux function
W, whose contours in the (y, z) plane show projected field line shapes.

¢ Blokland and Keppens (2011la) make the same 2.5D assumption, but exploit the
full freedom in the governing MHD equations that dictate which thermodynamic
quantity becomes a function of the flux coordinate Y only. Computing for the full
internal cross-sectional variation of a flux rope topology, nested flux surfaces (con-
tours of constant WY) can support stacked layers of denser material in a helical 3D
field. An example is shown in Fig. 2, where a fully force-balanced state shows field
lines (in red) and gray isosurfaces indicate where dense prominence matter levitates
in the magnetic dips.

ter rests as stacked in the dips (gray isosurfaces). The cross-sectional variation (in blue) quantifies
pressure throughout the flux rope, from Blokland and Keppens (2011a).

3.2 Addressing the energy balance

All models discussed above concentrate on the static force balance Eq. (2), and while
they provide valuable insights into multidimensional prominence-hosting magnetic
topologies, they do not fully address the additional role played by the energy equation,
which writes generally in terms of the plasma temperature T as follows.

RpAal + Rpv- VT + (y= ipV-v = (y= 1) [pL + V- (n(7*?)(6- VIB) (4)
In this equation, we wrote the ideal gas law as p = RpT, with gas constant R = kg/p
related to mean particle mass ys and Boltzmann constant kg, adopted a ratio of specific
heats + (typically 5/3) and we introduced two right-hand-side sources that generalize
the adiabatic setting where they are assumed to vanish. These two sources involve (1) a
net (per unit mass) heat gain-loss term £ that involves any coronal heating mechanism
and a radiative-loss term, as well as (2) the anisotropic (purely field-aligned) nature
of thermal conduction. The latter has a temperature-dependent parallel conduction
coefficient «(T°/?) with T = T/T, a dimensionless temperature using a temperature
unit T,,. Again adopting the simplification of static conditions where 0; = 0 and v = 0,
adiabatic settings obey Eq. (4) trivially, while non-adiabatic effects dictate that

0=pL+vV- (WT/)6 v7)b) (5)

This thermal balance must be realized throughout most of the (quiet) solar corona, and
in essence tells us indirectly that whatever mechanism h (per unit mass) is heating the
corona, a steady energy balance requires it to counteract the optically thin radiative
losses that contribute as a term —nenyA(T) in pL. The ionization degree will locally
set how the MHD density p relates to the number densities for electrons n. and protons
nx, while in fully ionized hydrogen settings we just have optically thin loss prescribed
as —p"A(T) /me with proton mass m ,. These optically thin losses, combined with
conduction, then would give a heating h that perfectly balances both in the form

ph = neng A(T) -V- ((9/)6 . v7)b) (6)

We thereby introduced the cooling curve A(T), which can be precomputed for optically
thin radiative loss conditions that depend on temperature and plasma composition.
In macroscopic prominences, the prominence matter itself is at about 10000 K, and
interior number densities reach n ~ 10!°cm~%, while their coronal environment is
much hotter and tenuous, making the assumption of purely optically thin radiative
losses invalid in their interiors, and requiring consideration of full non-local coupling
between radiation fields and plasma, beyond LTE assumptions. This is especially true
when one needs to accurately deduce thermodynamic variations, across the transi-
tion layer known as the prominence-corona transition region (PCTR). There, thermal
conduction as well as details of the varying ionization degree from external to inter-
nal prominence conditions must be accounted for. In cool condensations ny will be a
mixture of protons and neutral hydrogen, depending on the ionisation degree which
strongly depends on photoionisation processes, as detailed in the recent review by
Heinzel et al. (2024). Recent models (Benavitz et al. 2025) emphasize the need to
handle spatio-temporal abundances and account for the more complete dependence of
A(Te,ne, f) where f would quantify local, time-varying enhanced or diminished (with
respect to photospheric values) nx /n ratios for heavier elements X. Still, a long-
lived, quiescent prominence structure (but even a shorter-lived, smaller-scale coronal
rain blob in a loop) will try to achieve the approximate energy balance (6). For the
2.5D force-balance models discussed and shown in Fig. 2, realizing this energy balance
may select which of the thermodynamic quantities like density p, temperature T, or
entropy S' becomes a flux function f(W), which may well evolve during its lifetime.
A thorough consideration of both force Eq. (2) and steady energy balance Eq. (6)
was conducted in Low et al. (2012a), by adopting a Kippenhahn-Schliiter model aug-
mented with energy considerations. Low et al. (2012a) concluded that insisting on a
static model, a collapse to a singularly thin mass sheet is inevitable which in turn
invokes the need for resistive decay. This brings in the resistive induction equation as

0,B=V x (vx B-7J) , (7)

where the resistivity 7 will act to destroy the perfect frozen-in nature of ideal MHD
at current concentrations. For the ‘static’ prominence models in Low et al. (2012a),
the PCTR coincides with tangential discontinuities in the magnetic fields and hence
in localized discrete current layers, which must dissipate resistively. This causes slip-
page across the field and continuous cross-field mass transport (Low et al. 2012b),
while the interior (and exterior) of the prominence continuously restores both force
and energy balance. In that sense, internal dynamics is inevitable in ‘static’ settings.
Interestingly, Heasley and Mihalas (1976) identified a similar ‘collapse’ of a magneto-
hydrostatic equilibrium to a geometrically thin sheet, in their efforts to combine both
radiative and ideal magnetohydrostatic equilibrium requirements in a Kippenhahn-
Schliiter setup. While Heasley and Mihalas (1976) did not invoke resistive decay, but
rather focused on the intricate problem of (non-LTE) radiative, force and statisti-
cal equilibrium properties for illuminated slab models for quiescent prominences, it
is clear that PCTR conditions combine both resistive and non-LTE physics aspects
that must be improved in realistic MHD simulations. Combining ideal magnetohy-
drostatic Kippenhahn-Schliiter-type force considerations with 2D non-LTE radiative
transfer was done in Heinzel and Anzer (2001), constructing magnetically confined,
but vertically infinite threads with internal, horizontal 2D structure. We will point
out in the following sections that modern multi-dimensional prominence simulations
which solve for the nonlinear evolutions dictated by both Eq. (1) and Eq. (4) in vari-
ous magnetic topologies indeed confirm the analytic predictions on resistive slippage,
and make quiescent prominences fascinating long-lived macroscopic structures which
show rich smaller-scale dynamics, trying to ensure an evolution towards the combined
conditions posed by Eq. (2) and Eq. (6). In that respect, coronal cooling and heating
research is intricately linked, as argued in Section 1.

This suspected cooling-heating link is in line with earlier findings which assumed an
ad-hoc fixed shape for a prominence-hosting field line, on which the problem reduces
to the combined solution of the projected force balance Eq. (3) along with the static
energy Eq. (6). In Dahlburg et al. (1998) such 1D static equilibrium models for promi-
nences were constructed, where it was argued that a footpoint-concentrated heating
term h would be required, as well as a centrally dipped field line portion where the
prominence matter resides. Dahlburg et al. (1998) considered essentially the coronal
part of the dipped loop only, adopting their boundary conditions to the upper chro-
mosphere. The fact that 1D static solutions, from low chromosphere to corona, are
too idealized for hot loops was pointed out by Kuin and Martens (1982), noting that

he rapid temperature variation through the thin transition region effectively cou-
les the near-isothermal coronal loop part with the chromosphere, where locally the
conduction is much less efficient. A static solution that incorporates this transition
region between chromosphere and corona has a temperature structure along the loop
fully determined by loop length and adopted heating rate. Kuin and Martens (1982)
deduced 1D, time-dependent equations governing the entire loop-averaged density and
emperature, approximating the chromosphere-to-corona coupling in terms of a devi-
ation from such a static solution. This showed the possibility of limit cycle behavior
‘or loop-averaged thermodynamic quantities, essentially bringing in time-dependency
in the problem. When modeling low chromosphere to coronal regions, where also (rain
or prominence) condensations reside in the coronal region, there are multiple transi-
ion regions in the domain, not only the low-lying chromosphere-to-corona one, but
also one surrounding each condensation fragment. Together with the findings that the
PCTR invokes localized current concentrations, realistic models must handle all three
nonlinear, time-dependent laws posed by Eqs. (1), (4) and (7).

3.3 Dip-only model considerations

Since all prominence models invoke locally concave-upward, or dipped, field lines in the
enuous coronal environment, it has become customary to solve for purely force-free
3D magnetic fields, obeying J x B = 0. One then labels the concave upward field line
segments as “prominence” sites, even though there is no (hot or cold) plasma in these
models at all. This approach boils down to adopting a uniform, zero beta approxima-
ion, but the variation of plasma beta 3 = 2j9p/B? when a prominence or any kind
of condensation is incorporated can reach unit values (Heinzel and Anzer 1999). An
example of such a nonlinear force-free field configuration is shown in Fig. 3, taken from
Chen et al. (2024), where the self-consistent formation of a polar crown filament con-
figuration was demonstrated. The authors use a magnetofrictional approach to solve
or the gradual evolution of a bipolar arcade in a large spherical domain, with an ini-
ial (top left panel in Fig. 3) east-west PIL at 55° latitude. Magnetofrictional modeling
uses the induction Eq. (7) with a driving velocity that ultimately settles the mag-
netic field B on a force-free configuration. At each stage, a nonlinear force-free field
configuration is established numerically, while the bottom (photospheric) boundary
is driven by a time-varying realistic supergranular velocity field (Liu and Xia 2022).
Chen et al. (2024) investigate the role of latitude-dependent Coriolis forces, of changes
in the original PIL orientation, and a dependence on hemisphere location. The par-

ticular model shown in Fig. 3 (panel (f)) convincingly reproduces a large magnetic
flux rope structure with extended dipped regions where prominence matter may be
hosted, as needed for polar crown filaments.

By coloring the dips in magnetic nonlinear force-free fields as prominence sites,
we are also assuming that all visual thermodynamic structuring is always perfectly
field-aligned. Theoretically, this is not required by Eq. (2). The only thing that fol-
lows directly is the stratification along field lines from Eq. (3). Further specifying to
2.5D (say, x-invariant as in Fig. 2) conditions, this becomes a relation that links pres-
sure and density variations along constant magnetic flux U(y, z) contours. The full 3D
whole-prominence fine structure models presented by Gundér and Mackay (2015a,b)

instead start from a force-free magnetic topology and augment it with purely field-
aligned plasma that obeys hydrostatic equilibrium in selected dipped sections. By
adopting an observationally inspired cross-sectional extent (1000 km) of each plasma-
loaded field line, and invoking a related criterion to label field lines as independent, a
heuristic fine-structured model is constructed that can be used to confront emission
and absorption properties of prominence and filaments, respectively. This model was
adjusted (Gundr and Mackay 2015b) to mimic time-evolution, by changing the under-
lying nonlinear force-free field in a boundary-driven magnetofrictional setting similar
to Fig. 3. Synthetic Ha images could reproduce key features in observations, such
as barb creation, or dark voids. Despite these successes, the force-free backbone field
adopted ignores how condensed matter may change the magnetic topology locally, and
does not address finer-scale dynamics.

In what follows, we highlight efforts that go beyond purely force-balanced models,
as we concentrate on time-dependent, multi-dimensional momentum and energy evolu-
tions dictated by Eqs. (1) and (4). This shifts our attention to those physical processes
that actually control prominence (or rain) formation itself, and brings in prominence
internal dynamics. This calls for a thorough understanding of linear stability theory.

4 Linear MHD theory and the instability zoo
4.1 Ideal MHD spectroscopy

In the previous section, we noted that many model efforts reduce the 3D, fully non-
linear, time dependent problem posed by momentum and energy Eqs. (1) and (4) to
a balance of forces and the overall energy budget, as expressed in Eqs. (2) and (6).
These force and thermal balance equations describe the background or “equilibrium”
configuration that must hold on average in long-lived structures like prominences.
However, to understand how they form, or to study what drives small-scale internal
dynamics, time-dependence must be considered. Linear MHD theory, which quantifies

11
by computing all normal modes with a time-dependence
formation on the overall stability of the

this time-dependent aspec
given by exp(—iwt), provides us with direct in
equilibrium against small perturbations. Computing all the normal modes is termed
‘MHD spectroscopy’ (Goedbloed et al. 2019), where eigenvalue-eigenfunction pairs
obey the full set of linearized MHD equations. The spread of the eigenvalues through-
out the complex-valued w-plane dictates how an initial value problem will evolve, as
shown analytically in ideal MHD by Goedbloed (1998). A static configuration with
one-dimensional variation (such as a stratified atmosphere or radially varying loop)
has Alfvén and slow frequencies that form (stable wave, i.e. with real-valued w = wp)
continuous ranges which play a decisive role in the time evolution, apart from all dis-
crete normal modes. A discrete mode is an isolated w value that corresponds to more
globally varying eigenfunctions (although they can occur in sequences where fine-scale
eigenmode structure develops at specific locations), while a continuum mode is like
a truly singular local resonance. In a static, 1D MHD equilibrium setting, discrete
normal modes may be purely growing (or damped), with imaginary values for their
eigenfrequencies w = iv, providing us with growth rates v for instabilities. Countless
studies of specific equilibrium configurations have meanwhile identified many routes
‘o instability that all relate to discrete modes, including all well-known hydrodynamic
instabilities such as effective-gravity-driven Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI), shear-
flow-driven Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI), or the zoo of MHD instabilities that

argued for its relevance in explaining prominence formation, but also in astrophysical
settings beyond the solar realm. Field (1965) presented dispersion relations for uni-
orm hydro and MHD settings, included the effects of anisotropic thermal conduction,
and analysed condensation eigenmodes for fully stratified atmospheres. Also in labo-
ratory plasmas, thermal instability has been realized as being the cause of radiative
condensations (so-called “marfes”) that form in tokamak edge plasmas (Drake 1987).
n modern tokamaks equipped with divertors, these condensations also occur near the
X-point topologies, where they are termed X-point radiators, and they are affected

12
by impurity-driven radiative losses (Stroth et al. 2022). The theory of thermal insta-
bility has been revisited in a number of papers, such as Balbus (1986); Waters and
Proga (2019); Falle et al. (2020). However, the emphasis in these works was on dis-
persion relations for uniform media and on discrete condensation eigenmodes, which
would demonstrate rather global eigenfunction variations. Observations of filament
fine-structure as well as coronal rain itself rather confront us with truly localized
variation, so any formation mechanism should preferentially explain this substructure
during formation.

Such a more local response can be linked to the findings of van der Linden et al.
(1991), who discovered that a static MHD, infinite straight cylinder (flux rope) model
allows for a thermal continuum, in addition to the slow and Alfvén continuum wave
ranges discussed earlier. This thermal continuum can be purely unstable and couples
to the slow modes, while all discrete modes can be influenced by non-adiabatic pro-
cesses (e.g. discrete Alfvén modes can turn overstable and form prominences as argued
in Keppens et al. 1993). This thermal continuum generalizes the thermal instabil-
ity analysed by Parker (1953) and Field (1965) and likely explains the coronal rain
phenomenon in loops (Keppens et al. 2025), where again in-situ localized runaway is
witnessed. Typical solar coronal (atmosphere or loop) conditions with optically thin
radiative losses can hence show fragmentary condensations, due to an exponential
growth of the thermal continuum or associated thermal discrete eigenfunctions. In van
der Linden and Goossens (1991a) (for cylinders) and van der Linden and Goossens
(1991b) (for slabs), the linear MHD analysis accounted for anisotropic thermal con-
duction, with both parallel as well as finite perpendicular conduction kK (i.e. across
the magnetic surfaces). Accounting for small, but non-zero «, implied that highly
fine-structured eigenfunctions were found for thermal modes, as a natural explanation
for the fine-structure in prominences.

Ireland et al. (1992) generalized the MHD normal mode analysis from van der
Linden and Goossens (1991a) for the cylindrical case to include finite resistivity 7, and
confirmed that (1) «, = 0 = 7 has a stable Alfvén continuum next to a coupled (third
order in w) slow-thermal continuum; (2) when «, 4 0 while 7 = 0, we still have an
Alfvén continuum, but now an isothermal slow continuum and a dense set of discrete
(quasi-continuum) thermal modes; and (3) « = 0 and 7 # 0 removes both the Alfvén
and the slow continuum and shifts the thermal continuum, while replacing the original
thermal continuum range by densely packed discrete modes (a quasi-continuum).

The fact that linear MHD theory that incorporates all relevant conduction and
resistive effects always produces nearly singular, fine-structured unstable thermal
eigenmodes is consistent with the omnipresence of multithermal fine structure through-
out the chromosphere to the corona. For the laboratory counterpart of radiative
condensations called “marfes” in tokamaks (Drake 1987), a clear link with thermal con-
tinua in axisymmetric multi-dimensional tokamak equilibria has been demonstrated
by De Ploey et al. (2000). Note that De Ploey et al. (2000) quantified these continua
for an axisymmetric 2.5D equilibrium governed by Eq. (2) with gravity ignored, where
the three orthogonal directions Vp, J and B define the nested, donut-shaped flux
surfaces UY. Most recently, the thermal continuum for coronal flux ropes (as straight
cylinder structures) with both helical magnetic and flow fields in the configuration was

13
analysed by Hermans and Keppens (2024), with an excellent agreement between ana-
lytic predictions on (Doppler shifted) continua, discrete thermal modes and numerical
eigenmode computations.

Fig. 4 The 3D density structure resulting from TI in a local coronal volume. The view at right also
shows (in red) the background (nearly) homogeneous magnetic field, clearly not aligning with the
condensation fine structure. From Claes et al. (2020).

The most convincing means to show that thermal instability is the natural expla-
nation for any in-situ forming condensations, is to simulate this process ab-initio in
a uniform magnetized medium that is subject to radiative losses. This was done for
solar coronal settings in a series of papers (Claes and Keppens 2019; Claes et al. 2020;
Hermans and Keppens 2021), where Claes and Keppens (2019) revisited the thermal
instability (TI) theory from Field (1965) and its dispersion relation by quantifying all
eigenfunctions for homogeneous MHD media. Using this information, one can simulate
a local box of coronal plasma of which we know the exact (complex-valued) eigen-
modes and growthrates for instabilities, and clearly link the linear growthrate findings
with any runaway condensation. This was done in 2D settings by Claes and Keppens
(2019) and Hermans and Keppens (2021), where the latter showed the influence on the
condensation onset of the cooling curve A(T) in Eq. (6). One recurring finding from
these local-box nonlinear evolutions was that condensations originally orient perpen-
dicular to the local magnetic field, to then become subject to thin-shell instabilities

14
that cause their disruption. By also extending the simulations to full 3D, Claes et al.
(2020) pointed out that the thin-shell instabilities introduce fine-structure and cause
condensation fragments to ‘follow’ the field lines, although the strands that form do
not align with the uniform magnetic field adopted. This is shown in Fig. 4, where
the density structure due to TI and its consecutive thin-shell disruption is illustrated.
This finding may well have major implications, as filament observations usually infer
the (unmeasurable) magnetic field topology from the filament strands.

The works discussed thus far always adopted a single-fluid MHD viewpoint on
the corona, with local radiative losses as quantified in a cooling table A(T’) appro-
priate for optically thin settings. As soon as an actual in-situ condensation is
established, its associated density-temperature variation may well violate some of
the inherent assumptions in this approach. For instance, the degree of ionization
may vary drastically across the condensation (Heinzel et al. 2024). The linear the-
ory for TI in plasma-neutral mixtures, as well as the link with nonlinear runaway
condensation formation in local coronal boxes, was presented in Popescu Braileanu
and Keppens (2024). The (temperature dependent) ionization degree and coupling
between neutrals and charges influence the thermal mode growth. When ionization-
recombination is incorporated, the neutral fraction internal to the condensation can
increase substantially from its negligible value in the hot corona prior to condensation
onset.

4.4 Re-inventing linear thermal instability theory

Although the theoretical description of the thermal instability (TI), along with its
physical consequences, were introduced and discussed at length (37 pages) in the sem-
inal work by Field (1965), there are many works that in essence merely revisit its
findings. This is also true for Claes and Keppens (2019), which emphasized the polar-
izations - or eigenfunctions - of the perturbations, needed to selectively initiate a
nonlinear MHD simulation and follow non-adiabatic MHD modes (slow, Alfvén, fast
or entropy) into the nonlinear regime. Worth pointing out here is the unfortunate con-
fusion that can arise when revisiting the established theory on TI for uniform plasmas.
This is particularly evident for the much simpler case of a uniform, radiating gas, where
a pure hydrodynamic description suffices. This case is fully derived in Section I of
Field (1965) and it is well-known that a uniform, non-adiabatic gasdynamic medium,
where mass conservation, momentum equation (1), and energy equation (4) are lin-
earized assuming plane-wave perturbations of the form exp(—iwt + ik - x), yields a
third order polynomial for the dispersion relation w(k) as

w? — ir 1) — week? — i(y — 1) (poLp — ToLr) k? =0. (8)
Linearization is here done about a static and uniform medium (constant density pp and
temperature Tp, setting the uniform sound speed co) and for simplicity, we omitted
the added effect of thermal conduction (this is present in the equivalent eq. (15) from
Field (1965)). The medium is also assumed to achieve a thermal equilibrium, i.e. Lp =
0 for the equilibrium, implying that heating/cooling effects perfectly balance. The

Waters and Proga (2019), this is revisited and instead of the

statespace as used by Field (1965) (his Fig. 1), an equivalent discussion emphasizing
the wavelength dependence and the ratio of the coefficient of the second order (~
w?) and constant term from Eq. (8) is provided. It is thereby unfortunate that the

cases where up to three modes can be unstable are termed

and ‘fast isochoric’, at least from the viewpoint that slow and fast modes have a
clear meaning in MHD, while the hydro case only allows for entropy and (potentially
coalesced) acoustic modes. A similar cautionary comment applies to the work by
Kolotkov et al. (2020), who derive exactly the same dispersion relation as above (i.e.
a revisit of eq. (15) from Field (1965)), but this time calling it representative for

three real n solutions. In
complete discussion in the

‘entropy’, ‘slow isochoric’,

a thermal mode and a pair of slow MHD waves on an ‘infinite strength magnetic

field’. This ‘infinite magnetic field’ also renders the plasma

beta parameter zero, and

hence simplifies wave dynamics to a purely field-aligned, pressure and energy mediated

description, so a hydro setting is sufficient. Kolotkov et al.

(2020) then assumes there

is freedom in the heat-loss function p£L = ph—neny A(T) from equation (6), by taking
a heating function h x p*T? with a and 6 left as free parameters. The consequences
of varying a,b are then illustrated, arguing for an ‘active medium’ scenario (Kolotkov
et al. 2021) where ‘slow MHD’ waves are influenced by thermal misbalance and vice-
versa. One may question the adopted density-temperature dependence of the unknown

heating h(p,T), especially when non-uniformity of the ba

ckground is incorporated,

although the observation stands that wave damping or heating encodes information

on its variation.

Even more caution is due when following up on the recent claim by Waters and
Stricklan (2025) that ‘a seperate much simpler linear instability’ exists, which is the
isochoric mode initially discovered by Parker (1953). Only linearizing the tempera-

ture evolution equation, Parker (1953) argued that any set:

up where a positive Lr is

present (note our difference in sign convention for £ with earlier works), may lead to
runaway with exponential growth exp((y —1)£rt)/R. Field (1965) already discussed
that this isochoric criterion can be obtained from the general dispersion relation (8),
in a fairly specific limit which is ‘rarely met in practice’. Mathematically we could set

loop models, as discussed in section 5, but every condensation that actually forms and
becomes a rain blob or prominence is well associated with a manifestation of the TI.

4.5 Further MHD spectroscopic findings

As summarized in Section 4.2, the thermal instability (TI) of a radiative uniform
plasma gets replaced by an entire thermal continuum (TC) when we analyse
MHD spectrum of inhomogeneous media, like plane-parallel layers (van der Linde:
and Goossens 1991b) or cylindrical flux tubes (van der Linden and Goossens 199
Hermans and Keppens 2024) with internal equilibrium variations. This TC is als
resent in hydrodynamic settings accounting for gravitational stratification, besides
he radiative losses, as demonstrated in Keppens et al. (2025). This includes the fixed-
magnetic-field-line view on a coronal loop, where the basic state is one governed by
rojected, purely field-aligned motion and (mass and energy) conservation laws that
may be aware of the area-variation along the loop. TC can even be quantified for
hermally imbalanced states, i.e. states that deviate from the equality (6). Since we
already found that in-situ condensations (such as those forming in local coronal vol-
umes as shown in Fig. 4) directly relate to the TI, we can expect that the TC modes
play a role in actual time-evolutions of stratified, magnetized atmospheres as well as
along coronal loops. How exactly the TC impacts linear as well as nonlinear time-
dependent evolutions is yet to be appreciated fully, and is a topic of active research.
An example of such study is the work by De Jonghe and Sen (2025),
he intricate link between resistive tearing modes and the TC for a
sheet equilibrium, using a combined linear MHD spectral and non!
approach. Such studies are inspired by findings from multi-dimensional nonlinear MHD

which considers
force-free Harris
inear simulation

17
simulations that include resistivity and optically thin radiative losses, where intricate
interplay between resistive tearing and TI/TC condensations was demonstrated: 2D
island chains could form trapped condensations within plasmoids (Sen and Keppens
2022) and 3D reconnecting current sheets were shown to drive condensation forma-
tion in their vicinity (Sen et al. 2023). While these studies ignored gravity, they did
represent typical coronal (temperature, density and plasma beta) conditions, hinting
that these mode interactions must be at play in fully realistic settings as well.

In that context, an important insight from modern MHD spectroscopy was
presented by Claes and Keppens (2021), who computed all linear eigenmodes for grav-
itationally stratified, plane-parallel atmospheres with possibly height-varying, sheared
horizontal magnetic field. After showing how the spectrum changes from adiabatic to
non-adiabatic cases, this study performed MHD spectroscopy in a fully realistic solar
atmosphere. While the adiabatic case is analytically tractable when taking a uniform
magnetic field and constant density scale height, allowing to recover and extend work
on stable magneto-atmospheric waves (Nye and Thomas 1976), the solar atmosphere
case had a realistic photosphere to coronal variation from 0 to 25 Mm height, including
he transition region variation. Computing all MHD eigenmodes in thermally bal-
anced setting (obeying Eq. (6)), it was found that unstable thermal modes prevail
hrough the chromosphere and into the corona, while overstable slow modes mani-
est themselves mostly in the low corona. Figure 5 demonstrates this by showing the
height regions identified as unstable, for both thermal and slow modes. The full non-
adiabatic MHD eigenmode spectra can also be computed for purely chromospheric, or
purely coronal regions, and it showed how thermal instability is nearly unavoidable.
This aligns with the observational fact that the chromosphere is highly structured and
filled with chromospheric fibrils, and in a sense ‘explains’ the multiphase nature of the
solar corona (showing rain and prominences).

That the linear MHD spectrum not only explains in-situ condensation formation,
ut also signals actual internal dynamics, was pointed out in Blokland and Keppens
(2011b), who computed the entire continuous spectrum for the prominences in flux
ropes as shown in Fig. 2. In such 2.5D force-balanced settings governed by Eq. (2),
he nested flux contours that form the flux rope may have unstable continua, which
now quantify modes that may grow near an isolated flux contour. If, during any time
in the flux rope evolution, the density ends up being constant along the flux contours,
it turns out that instability may arise when the flux-surface projected Brunt-Vaisala
frequency N2,, ,,, becomes negative, as given by

identified in fully nonlinear, multi-dimensional prominence forming flux rope scenar-
ios (Jenkins and Keppens 2021). It leads to a rapid matter redistribution occurring
along the flux contour, and acts as a seed for consecutive thermal instability. Simi-
lar links between coronal rain formation and the linear stability criteria expressed in
Eq. (9) were demonstrated for 3D coronal rain formation in Moschou et al. (2015).
These findings on the possibility for unstable continuum modes (both TC and CCI
modes) are to be contrasted with stability quantification for discrete Rayleigh-Taylor
or interchange modes, which usually use growthrate estimates that adopt simple two-
layer equilibrium models. In reality, the richness of the (evolving) MHD spectrum for a
magnetic flux rope or arcade system will impact its nonlinear evolution in ways which
we do not fully understand just yet. We now turn our attention to insights gathered
from purely nonlinear simulations based on the time-evolving governing equations.

5 Findings from 1D nonlinear hydro evolutions

If we ignore all the intricacies of multi-dimensional MHD, we can reduce our problem
to a 1D hydrodynamic view of what happens along a pre-fixed coronal loop or arcade
field bundle. Then, the given field line shape dictates the flow along it, where we
solve for a velocity vj(s,t) = b-v and s is the coordinate along the loop. This may
incorporate an area-variation A(s), related to a field strength variation B(s) that

19
ensures flux conservation as in B(s)A(s) = constant. In any case, we then have mass
conservation

Gos Apuy) = 0, (10)

along with the field-line projected variant of Eq. (1) as well as the energy equation (4).
Although this eliminates all MHD processes (as it projects away the Lorentz force), the
field line shape can be taken arbitrary and may include a dipped section such as those
considered in the dip-only models discussed in Section 3.3. The linear waves retained
in such models are only non-adiabatically modified pressure-driven p-modes, while
the TC remains a robust ingredient of the (hydrodynamic) normal mode spectrum
(Keppens et al. 2025). This, in combination with steep gradients in temperature and
density at transition region heights, makes the reduction to 1D still relevant and
challenging to compute, especially given the limit cycle possibilities for loop-averaged
quantities, as pointed out by Kuin and Martens (1982).

5.1 Evaporation-condensation models

That such a 1D loop model can indeed form a stable prominence near the loop top was
shown convincingly by Mok et al. (1990), where an initially semicircular field line was
1eated near its legs with an exponentially decaying heating function. For this specific
configuration, the decay distance must be shorter than 12 % of the total length of the
oop to trigger condensation. This ultimately triggered the formation of a Tl-induced
condensation, although the link with the stability criteria of Field (1965) was not
explicitly made. The loop connected the deep chromosphere to the corona, and the
shape of the field line was altered to have an imposed central dip, once the density of
he condensation exceeded some threshold. This allowed the condensation to persist
stably in the corresponding gravitational well.
Analogous simulations of a loop with a prefixed central dipped region were
done by Antiochos and Klimchuk (1991), where the authors emphasized how a uni-
orm weak heating plus an additional strong heating localized near loop footpoints
with an exponentially decaying heating function can trigger condensation to form a
chromospheric-density prominence. The process of chromospheric evaporation from
footpoint-localized heating was shown to be essential for prominence formation. This
evaporation-condensation scenario was later revisited with fully grid-adaptive 1D sim-
ulations in Antiochos et al. (1999), allowing to reach quasi-steady-state conditions
with a central condensation of size 5000 km.
This evaporation-condensation mechanism was subsequently investigated under
asymmetric heating conditions, in similar loop settings (Antiochos et al. 2000). The
loop itself extended 320 Mm, showing a long, shallow dipped section. A cyclic behay-
ior with condensation formation, movement, and destruction was witnessed, and the
authors coined this time-dependent behavior ‘Thermal Non-Equilibrium’ or TNE.
This inherent time-dependent evolution - despite having no time-dependent heating
imposed on the loop - was backed up with order-of-magnitude estimates of the pressure
imbalance across a condensation, causing the condensation to move. Condensations
formed due to a A(T) « T~? power law for the cooling function. This power index b
plays a determining role, fully consistent with the linear TI and TC theory, where the

partial derivatives of the heat-loss function £ with respect to density £, and tempera-
ture Lr enter the dispersion relation (our Eq. (8)) and set the entire TC range. Based
on their 1D model, the authors argued that the TNE state of a coronal loop form-
ing condensations is always nearly in hydrostatic equilibrium (i.e. obeying Eq. (3)),
but fails to achieve thermal balance as expressed in our Eq. (6). As recently shown
in Keppens et al. (2025), this thermal imbalance can be fully incorporated in linear
spectroscopy and then clarifies the role of TC, as well as of non-adiabatically modified
p-modes, in the observed evolution. Curiously, Antiochos et al. (2000) even argued
that magnetic dips hosting prominence matter must be preexisting, since a conden-
sation would tend to move away from the loop apex, before it can weigh it down.
Of course, prominence-weight-induced dips can only be realized in multi-dimensional

21
MHD settings (Xia et al. 2012), and are at the very heart of the Kippenhahn and
Schliiter (1957) model to ensure internal force balance in prominences.

The same model ingredients were used in semi-circular, short (10 Mm) loop set-
ings by Miiller et al. (2003) and the cyclic formation and falling down of condensations
were evident, as illustrated in Fig. 6. This work already made it clear that the pro-
cesses behind coronal rain are identical to those that dictate prominence formation,
and loop length and shape are hence relevant parameters to vary, besides those con-
rolling the heating and cooling prescriptions. Follow-up modeling (Miiller et al. 2005)
confronted the obtained rain blob speeds with observations, finding a very satisfactory
agreement with speeds of the order of 100 km/s, decelerating when approaching the
upper chromosphere. This places their speeds below free fall, and pressure gradients
hat build up across the falling blobs nicely explain their slowing velocity patterns.

Mendoza-Briceiio et al. (2005) again focused on semi-circular loops, but varied the
heating to mimic randomly appearing Gaussian energy pulses near the footpoints.
Both the loop lengths, as well as the (controlled) time between energy impulses, affect
he outcome, with condensations only found beyond a critical elapsed time between
pulse injections. It should be noted that the semi-circular loop lengths considered only
ranged from 5 to 30 Mm, so they would be rather low-lying loops.

Karpen et al. (2005) updated the evaporation-condensation model by taking into
account area variation A(s), updating the cooling curve A(T’), and adopting a field line
shape extracted from an actual 3D sheared-arcade ideal MHD simulation. By adopting
asymmetric localized heating between left and right footpoint, new dynamic features
were found, including the appearance of paired condensations that eventually merged.
A similar strategy was followed in Luna et al. (2012), where again individual field
lines from a 3D MHD configuration of a sheared arcade were simulated independently,
but the visualizations performed translated the 1D hydro findings into their fixed
3D magnetic geometry. Both condensation threads and blobs were ubiquitous, with
threads residing in dipped field line sections, and blobs falling to the chromosphere.

Susino et al. (2010) used randomly selected snapshots of 1D hydro loop models to
assimilate a synthetic differential emission measure (DEM) of a multi-stranded coronal
loop. Condensations formed when impulsive heating was localized at footpoints, but
they did not affect the synthesized DEMs.

That each condensation that forms is ultimately caused by TI was demonstrated
in Xia et al. (2011), by showing direct agreement with the criteria of TI. This work
investigated filament formation in a loop with a shallow dip, using grid-adaptive
computations with a yet more realistic cooling curve prescription. Even when the chro-
mospheric heating is turned off after some finite time, filament growth can continue
due to siphon flows established towards the filament thread. Extending these 1D sim-
ulations to cover multiple days after turning off the heating, such that the filament
length saturates, Zhou et al. (2014) established how this length depends on the dipped
field line parametrizations, like its half-width, depth and altitude.

Klimchuk and Luna (2019) presented approximate analytical formulae for predict-
ing when limit cycle behavior (or TNE) is almost guaranteed. In a simple symmetric
(say, semi-circular) loop, it will be impossible to get a real stationary state achieved

This formula contains (averaged) volumetric heating rates H for loop footpoint regions
versus its apex, and the cross-section of the loop is Aj, at transition region heights
versus A, for its coronal section. The radiative losses per unit area (in ergcm™~?s~)
for transition region versus corona appear as Rty,,<. This relates directly to our
equation (6), since H = ph (where f is an averaged f) and an energy balance in a
oop of length L becomes A,.LH = ALi? A(T.) + AtrRtr, hence requiring the total
heating of the coronal loop to balance the summed coronal radiative losses with losses
across the transition region. The transition region losses are then inserted from an
order-of-magnitude estimate based on the downwards conductive heat flux from the
corona, i.e. setting Rir = A(TAT./ Ly This leads to estimates of the temperature T..
hroughout the coronal section, and using the ideal gas law, the balance fixes the

entire coronal loop thermodynamics. The TNE condition from Eq. (11) then simply
results from distinguishing the heating in a loop-footpoint-concentrated, versus a kind
of overall (weaker) background heating near the apex, which causes a conflict in the
emperature as estimated from Hoot versus Hapex. Note that the footpoint heating
must hence always exceed the background one, in order for cyclic behavior to be at
lay. We note in particular that there is no mention of any partial derivatives of the
heat/loss function £ which feature prominently in all TI criteria, such as in the dis-
ersion relation (8) or its generalization to the thermal continuum (Keppens et al.
2025). Klimchuk and Luna (2019) provide a second condition relevant for asymmetries

between footpoints (in either heating or geometry or both) and verify their predictions
with 1D hydro simulations. Other aspects, like the required numerical resolution as
well as heating timescales, are discussed in Johnston et al. (2019).

5.2 Model extensions and parameter surveys

By extending the model to a 1.5D setup, where also Alfvén waves can be incorporated,
Antolin et al. (2010) showed that coronal rain formation can encode information on
the coronal heating mechanism. To model Alfvén wave heating, the model is extended
with a velocity vg(s,t) and magnetic field component By(s,t) quantifying rotational
flow and twist about the flux tube axis. By contrasting 1D hydro scenarios with
parametrized ‘nanoflare heating’, versus 1.5D setups with Alfvén wave heating, the
former was more prevalent to lead to coronal rain events. This links with the finding
from formula (11), in the sense that Alfvén heating becomes more uniform over the
loop, while the nanoflare setup was concentrated at footpoints. These rain-oriented
simulations adopted a semi-circular loop shape. This 1.5D approach was also adopted
in Yoshihisa et al. (2025), where instead of a quasi-steady, localized heating, conden-
sations could be triggered by a single heating event in a dipped coronal loop. Alfvén
waves converted to longitudinal compressive waves (p-modes) that steepened into
shocks, and ultimately triggered condensation formation. A key finding from Yoshihisa

23
et al. (2025) is that the total amount of heating integrated over time is a discriminat-
ing factor for TI onset: even short pulses of sufficient strength can trigger condensation
‘ormation and a modification to formula (11) was suggested.

Another interesting extension in 1.5D was presented by van Hoven et al. (1992),
where the authors added equations for the perpendicular velocity v | (s,t), and the self-
consistent weight-induced field deformation B|(s,t). In a two-stage simulation they
ollowed the thermal-instability driven condensation, and the resulting bending of the
field, to provide a stably supported prominence. The role of a siphon flow towards the
loop apex, set up by a pressure drop as radiative losses increase, was pointed out as
well.

Triggered by observationally established, long-period EUV intensity variations in
active region loops (Auchére et al. 2014), a thorough parameter survey of 1D hydro
oop models was performed by Froment et al. (2018). The authors linked the cyclic
condensation formation and inherent time-dependent variation of coronal loops that

undergo specific heating and cooling conditions to the detected periodicities. Using a
suite of 1020 different simulations, Froment et al. (2018) varied loop geometry and the
adopted heating configurations. All loop geometries could realize repeated heating-
cooling cycles, again termed as TNE manifestations, if the heating prescription was
favorable: especially stratified heating with footpoint concentration was found neces-
sary. Cyclic behavior in active region loop models clearly prefers a specific combination
of parameters, while actual condensations (coronal rain) and long period intensity
variations can occur together. An even more extended parameter survey by Pelouze
et al. (2022) included up to 9000 individual 1D hydro runs, augmenting earlier stud-
ies with especially asymmetric loop and heating conditions. To understand why some
loops show time-dependent quasi-periodic variations (TNE cycles) without rain, ver-
sus others where actual condensations appear, the loops were taken to mimic an actual
rain-producing event (Auchére et al. 2018), and systematic scans concluded that asym-
metric loops are less likely to produce rain, unless their imposed heating compensates
for the asymmetry. Pelouze et al. (2022) highlighted that the same magnetic loop
could lead to prominence formation, or to periodic time variation with or without
rain condensations, depending on the imposed (parametrized) heating. Kucera et al.
(2024) changed the heating prescription to one consisting of many impulsive, discrete
energy pulses (so-called nanoflares) along the loop, varying their location and fre-
quency. Fully randomized nanoflares were less favorable to condensation formation,
although the added freedom in frequency and location on the imposed pulses could
occasionally trigger rain events, while equivalent steady heating showed no thermal
instability. Repeated pulses with short time separations, located near footpoints, do
produce condensations, consistent with steady parametrized heating findings.

The evaporation-condensation scenario to form coronal condensations feeds on
the fact that excess (coronal) heating leads to excess conductive flux from corona
to chromosphere, inducing evaporation, and as the density in the corona increases,

more radiative loss results. Heating may then no longer balance the losses, in other
words, a thermal misbalance results. As clarified in Keppens et al. (2025), such a
thermal misbalance impacts the entire linear spectrum of non-adiabatic p-modes and
TC modes, and since the spectrum of normal modes essentially dictates the early

24
temporal evolution, it is perfectly possible that the same loop structure subjected
to varying heating H(s,t) = p(s,t)h(s,t) as appearing in the net-heat-loss function
L will cause the loop to evolve differently. For both parametric studies by Froment:
et al. (2018) and Pelouze et al. (2022), it would be of interest to quantify how the
entire linear spectrum of non-adiabatic p- and TC eigenmodes changes by the thermal
imbalance due to the adopted heating prescriptions, and to see whether and how
the linear spectrum relates to the various nonlinear evolutions (with and without
rain formation). In the same spirit of addressing the role of the imposed heating,
Huang et al. (2021) clarified that the 1D hydro model can even unify two different
pathways to prominence formation: one based on evaporation-condensation, versus
one in which chromospheric matter is injected into the corona. This unified model in
essence varied the H(s,t) prescription to heat either the lower chromosphere or the
upper one. Taking a Gaussian pulse for the localized heating in both space and time, a
lower heating deposition led to pressure-induced injection of matter, while heating the
upper chromosphere fitted the traditional evaporation-condensation scenario. These
findings did not account for important non-LTE effects, especially relevant in (lower)
chromospheric regions, and were obtained for a loop with a centrally dipped portion.

Most 1D results discussed thus far considered either semi-circular loops, or adopted
field lines extracted from a sheared arcade setup, with the latter looking at rather long
field lines with extended dipped sections. For actual large-scale prominence settings,
dipped field line sections exist in both sheared arcades and magnetic flux rope setups,
and the flux rope topology is believed to be dominant (Ouyang et al. 2017). Therefore,
repeating the 1D hydro approach in flux rope settings was realized by Guo et al.
(2022), using an analytical flux rope model where the twist can be controlled. This
twist turned out to dictate the detailed distribution of threads throughout the flux
rope, as well as their dynamic evolution. It was also discovered that the filament spine
does not really align with the flux rope axis, or the underlying PIL, so observational
deductions on magnetic field topology from the filament morphology must be treated
with caution.

Another recent extension of the 1D hydro models on evaporation-condensation
(and TNE or TI/TC condensations) is the work by Scott et al. (2024), who studied how
a transonic 1D solar wind on an open, radially expanding field line can give rise to very
similar cyclic behavior. When condensations formed, their formation height related
to the scale of the imposed footpoint heating. To interpret these findings with linear
theory and the role of TI and TC, an extension of the work by Keppens et al. (2025)
to diagnose all non-adiabatic, normal modes for moving and transonic configurations
is called for.

Other modern extensions of the 1D hydrodynamic viewpoint on prominence and
coronal condensation formation include the pioneering study of Jeréié et al. (2025),
where a two-fluid model is adopted that accounts for both plasma and neutral species.
Indeed, the ionization fraction within a prominence structure differs markedly from
the coronal environment, where full ionization prevails. The evaporation-condensation
prominence formation scenario, involving TI to trigger the runaway, fully carries over
to a two-fluid setting. Pronounced two-fluid effects appear in shocks that accompany
the first complete condensation. Decoupling effects also appear in the PCTR, with

velocity differences between both species on the order of 100 m s~+. Although these
are challenging to detect, transient decouplings have been inferred in prominence
observations of precisely these magnitudes (Khomenko et al. 2016; Zapidr et al. 2022).

A study by Martinez-Gémez et al. (2022) analyzes a similar plasma-neutral sce-
nario, but in a 2D setting, and finds that ion-neutral decouplings of order of 1 km s~+
may develop on falling coronal rain blobs. The rain blob was initially inserted as a
localized density enhancement in both charges and neutrals, and then followed when
falling through an isothermal corona with purely vertical, initially uniform magnetic
field. It would be of interest to include the actual Tl-based condensation formation as
well in future plasma-neutral studies for gravitationally stratified, multi-dimensional
settings. Note that the study of ad-hoc inserted, falling rainblobs, as influenced by
gravity, density ratio and pressure variations has been studied in idealized settings in
various studies, such as Oliver et al. (2014); Hillier et al. (2025).

5.3 Frozen-Field Hydrodynamics: towards 3D models

All findings discussed thus far adopt rigid magnetic field backgrounds, where the
magnetic field variation at most enters through an area-expansion A(s) along the fixed
field line, as in the mass conservation law from Eq. (10). Analogous to the dip-only
models by Gunar and Mackay (2015a), visualizations can adopt some finite cross-
sectional size and a heuristic inter-thread spacing, to create the illusion of 3D structure
as showcased in Luna et al. (2012) for sheared arcades, or by Guo et al. (2022) for
flux ropes.

In contrast, truly 3D volume-filling hydrodynamic evolutions in any (frozen) mag-
netic topology can be studied as well, following the technique introduced by Mok et al.
(2005). Using our earlier notation of the local unit vector b along the fixed magnetic
field, the governing equations read as

ap+tV: (6% b) 0, (12)
; (pv) + V- { (2? | P) b pg 4 p(v-b) i (13)

e+V- [le + p)vyb joy tV- [e(1)(b ‘ v7)b| +pl, (14)

Pp.

Ss

where we write the equations in terms of the momentum density pv, and total energy
density e = puj/2 +p/(y —1). The magnetic field is still a fully externally fixed, 3D

topology, forcing only field-aligned flow v = vb. This frozen-field hydro model still
can not address weight-induced dipping of field lines, or any of the relevant MHD
instabilities (Rayleigh-Taylor, interchange, CCI), but it provides a computationally
affordable way to study parametrized heating prescriptions contained in pL.

This frozen-field hydro model was adopted to study filament formation in arcades
by Zhou et al. (2024), followed by filament formation in a 3D twisted flux rope in
Zhou et al. (2025b). This approach allows for exactly the same freedom in parametric
surveys that relate to the evaporation-condensation scenario: one can impose any 3D
field topology, vary the spatio-temporal behavior of the heating function and switch the
cooling table A(T). It has the advantage that one can prescribe heating dependencies

26
aware of local magnetic field h(B(x)), or any of the observationally established heating
dependencies H(B, p,T) = ph(B, p,T). Moreover, many heating models, as suggested
by early scaling laws (Rosner et al. 1978), depend not only on local values like B, p,
and T, but also on the local magnetic field line length L. In full 3D MHD models,
computing L at every point and time step is often too expensive, since field line
integration is costly. However, in the frozen-field HD approach, the magnetic field is
static. This means the field line lengths only need to be computed once, at the start
of the simulation. After that, they can be used as fixed parameters to guide spatial
heating profiles. This makes it practical to include L-dependent heating models, which
would be difficult to implement in dynamic MHD setups. Its volume-filling nature also
ensures that one can directly translate the setup to synthetic observables by performing
line-of-sight integrations, and the area-variation we had to introduce artificially in
a single field line setting is now incorporated automatically, by means of divergence
evaluations of physical fluxes.

heating. Right panel: When the heating is randomized in both space and time, the resulting promi-
nence develops fine structure and exhibits more dynamic behavior. In both panels, the background
color denotes atmospheric temperature, the blue contour traces the 15,000 K isocontour (highlight-
ing the cool prominence), and the gray lines show selected magnetic field lines.

As an example, Fig. 7 shows a filament formed in a twisted flux rope (much like
the one adopted in Guo et al. (2022)), where we contrast the obtained prominence
structure when the heating is varied. In the study at left, taken from Zhou et al.
(2025b), the flux rope was subjected to a foot-point concentrated heating, which was
applied steadily for several hours before it was turned off, and a relatively monolithic,
steady prominence (indicated by the blue contour outlining the 15,000 K isocontour
region in the figure) is formed that occupies the entire bottom of the flux rope. If we
instead change the heating to a more randomized (in both space and time) prescription,
the prominence forms pronounced fine-structure, and behaves more dynamically, as
indicated by the fragmented and evolving structure in the right panel. This is again
a clear indication that the evaporation-condensation scenario, along with the linear
hydrodynamic spectrum enriched by TI/TC eigenmodes, may well allow us to deduce
knowledge on the unknown local coronal heating, through the detailed morphology
and dynamic behavior of prominences.

6 Condensations forming and evolving in MHD

Even though the essentially 1D hydro models discussed in the previous section 5 pro-
vide insight into the mass and energy circulation in idealized loop or arcade flux
bundles, all observed condensations are best described in a multi-dimensional mag-
netohydrodynamic (MHD) setting, where we have to face the full nonlinear set of
equations (1)-(4)-(7)-(10). These nonlinear PDEs describe the macroscopic plasma
dynamics fully, and are aware of the entire zoo of linear waves and instabilities
mentioned in Section 4. Especially in such multi-dimensional MHD settings, many
breakthroughs in modeling prominence and coronal rain formation occurred in the past
decade. We organize these according to magnetic topology in this section, discussing
models with 2D arcades, models targeting flux rope cross-sectional evolutions, up to
full 3D topologies. A complementary means to classify all these models is provided
in Table 1, which serves to emphasize the actual formation pathway of the conden-
sations. In that respect, multi-dimensional MHD has gone significantly beyond the
evaporation-condensation model, which is the one that is almost primarily researched
within 1D models. Next to injection, levitation and evaporation-condensation,
the table lists novel formation mechanisms like plasmoid-fed-prominence-formation
(PF?), emergence-driven prominence formation, or reconnection-levitation mecha-
nisms, which all invoke the ubiquitous reconnection that occurs throughout the
dynamic solar corona. In every formation pathway, the ultimate local trigger for
actual condensation is invariably linked to thermal instability (TI), as discussed in
Sections 4.2-4.3.

6.1 2D magnetic arcade evolutions

We first discuss magnetic arcade setups, which may involve bipolar or quadrupolar
magnetic field configurations, and either look at a multi-dimensional MHD evolution in
a vertical plane (perpendicular to the solar surface, containing the direction of gravity)
or in the actual curved 2D surface that corresponds to the magnetic flux surfaces.
The latter will be termed ‘fixed arcade’ models, since there we do not allow field line
ending in the direction of gravity, but only within the magnetic surface itself.

6.1.1 Deforming arcade models

Choe and Lee (1992) demonstrated the clear possibility for in-situ condensations
ormed by TI, with a pioneering model of prominence formation in a coronal arcade
disturbed by shearing the arcade field lines. The prominence weight suffices to dip the
central arcade field lines, and a Kippenhahn-Schliiter type topology develops natu-
rally, as shown in Fig 8. The authors considered only the corona, so there is no other
‘ormation pathway than TI/TC mediated runaway cooling. In a later conference pro-
ceedings, Choe and Cheng (1998) reported that the same in-situ TI pathway can be
used to form both Kippenhahn-Schliiter, as well flux-rope embedded Kuperus-Raadu
rominence types, and even found a prominence condensing in between two bipolar
arcades.

By including the chromosphere and transition region, the first evaporation-
condensation based model in a footpoint-heated, bipolar 2.5D arcade by Xia et al.

Fig. 8 A snapshot of the early MHD simulation by Choe and Lee (1992), after the prominence

has formed by in-situ TI. The arcade magnetic field develops a locally dipped section centrally (left
panel), weighed down by the in-situ condensation as seen in density (right).

(2012) quantified the Kippenhahn-Schliiter force balance throughout the prominence,
while the initial in-situ condensation was shown to agree with linear TI instability crite-
ria. By varying the magnetic topology to a quadrupolar arcade with a centrally dipped
portion from the beginning, Keppens and Xia (2014) could follow the evaporation-
condensation scenario into the hours-long evolution of a prominence. In their study,
the filament weight ultimately triggered reconnection and the formation of a flux rope
filled with prominence matter, while also coronal-rain-like drainage occurred during
the evolution.

Staying in a quadrupolar setting, considering only 2D in-plane vector fields, Zhou
et al. (2023) made a clear link between the observationally established ‘winking fila-
ment’ behavior and the evaporation-condensation scenario. By making the localized
footpoint heating cyclic, the resulting stretching and up-down movement of the promi-
nence can indeed result in a periodic appearing and disappearing from Ha line center
and line wings. Using synthetic Ha filament views integrating along a vertical line-
of-sight, clear ‘winking’ was demonstrated with a periodicity that differs from the
imposed cyclic heating, as understood from a forced oscillator analogy. The Ha syn-
thesis was based on the approximate method as introduced by Heinzel et al. (2015),
but Jenkins et al. (2023) shows excellent agreement with more advanced non-LTE
computations for a similar 3D MHD prominence model.

Huang et al. (2025) presented 2D MHD simulations of a dipped arcade, where a
flux emergence event (an ephemeral bipole) is mimicked by a time-evolving bottom
boundary prescription. This leads to (anomalously controlled) reconnection when the
bipole emerges near a footpoint of the pre-existing dipped field. It was shown how the
height of the resulting reconnection (lower to upper chromosphere) indeed recovers
the 1D proof-of-principle study by Huang et al. (2021) which unified injection and

30
evaporation prominence formation pathways: prominences could form in both ways,
but this time in 2D setups, as a result of reconnection-induced heating.

Fig. 9 Prominence topologies differ greatly for steady (left) versus stochastic (right) heating scenar-
ios, as demonstrated by Jeréié et al. (2024). Shown is the density variation from low chromosphere
to corona, with the magnetic topology indicated at left. The domain shown is 100 Mm x 80 Mm.
Steady heating forms a vertical prominence, while stochastic heating favors dynamically evolving,
horizontal threads.

Jercié et al. (2024) performed 2.5D simulations of a chromosphere to corona
quadrupolar arcade, where the obtained prominence topologies differed markedly
depending on the imposed heating. As illustrated in Fig. 9, the same topological setup
can form a more vertical prominence structure (at left), or show a more horizontal,
fragmented prominence (at right), when steady (left) versus impulsive heating (at
right) is acting near the upper chromosphere. Stochastic heating leads to threadlike
structures that are highly dynamic, while the steady heating shows a typical vertical
slab-like prominence, where the weight-induced field line deformation can even trig-
ger localized reconnection high up in the corona. Since the two scenarios were not
exactly tailored to deliver the same amount of energy injected into the corona, and
both scenarios invoked several parameters (like pulse durations and amplitudes for
the stochastic case), follow-up studies could parametrically explore which of the two
topologies prevails, depending on total injected energies as spread over background
and localized (steady to stochastic) regimes. Finally, by changing the 2.5D quadrupo-
lar arcade such that its central X-point is embedded in the corona, Johnston et al.
(2025) formed dynamic prominences, that demonstrated reconnection-based drainage
through the coronal X-point.

In summary, 2D deforming arcade models have already shown rich morphologies
in the obtained prominences, and the weight-induced effects combined with the pos-
sibility for field line reconnection, can cause rather dynamic prominence-rain hybrid
evolutions. In line with the findings of simplified 1D fixed-loop models, the spatio-
temporal details of the imposed heating have a direct impact on the prominence
appearance and evolution.

6.1.2 Fixed arcade models

As a meaningful 2D MHD generalization of the 1D fixed-field line approach, Zhou et al.
2020) introduced a 2D model of a fixed arcade where we allow for field line bending in
he given magnetic surface. The idea is to follow the thermodynamic as well as mag-
netic evolution in the curved surface that connects the left to right footpoint regions of
an arcade. By pioneering an imposed randomized heating near both footpoint regions
random in space and time, but exponentially stratified along the arcade), Zhou et al.
(2020) demonstrated the formation of threadlike structures, accompanied with coun-
erstreaming flows. Indeed, random evaporation can drive longitudinal oscillations
of threads, as well as inter-thread unidirectional flow patterns, which alternate. A
‘ollow-up study by Jeréié and Keppens (2023) quantified the effect of the randomized
heating pulse heights and amplitudes on the self-consistent multi-threaded prominence
‘ormation. An example is shown in Fig. 10, illustrating the fixed arcade concept. Con-
densation rates were found proportional to the heating pulse amplitudes, and in full
agreement with rates inferred from observations.

view, from Jeréié and Keppens (2023). The 2D MHD simulation maintains the arcade shape shown,
but allows for cross-field coupled evolutions with field line bending possible in the curved surface.
The threaded prominence structure evolves dynamically due to randomized heating at both feet.

6.1.3 To rain or not to rain

Several of the 2D arcade simulations discussed showed that while forming a large scale
prominence, smaller coronal rain condensations may occur as well, such as seen in the
left panel of Fig. 9. The heating prescription as well as the magnetic topology and
strength combine to create conditions that may prevent the collection of condensed
matter into a macroscopic prominence. The first multi-dimensional demonstration
of actual coronal rain was presented by Fang et al. (2013), where a bipolar arcade
with footpoint localized, but steady, heating showed blob characteristics that directly
matched with observations. The model demonstrated the possibility of blobs which

32
condensed in-situ in the corona and then evaporated while falling prior to reaching the

chromosphere, or blobs that

PCTR structure that forms

similar. A key difference is

get siphoned over the apex of the loops. Blob widths and

engths that averaged 400 to 800 km (in adaptive simulations that resolved cells of 78
km at best) must be compared with current insights on coronal rain fine structure.
Higher-resolution (up to 20 km detail), longer term studies by Fang et al. (2015)
followed the cyclic occurrence of coronal rain showers in arcades. They identified how
each coronal rain blob can be accompanied by fully 2D-shaped rebound shocks due
© pressure-mediated siphon flows, while counterstreaming flows may break up blob
strands into several segments. Blob deformations, and blobs impacting the transition
region to merge with chromospheric matter, were discussed in detail, along with the

around each individual rain feature. We note in passing

hat the basic model ingredients (topology of the field, steady left-right symmetric
heating) from Xia et al. (2012), where a monolithic prominence was formed, versus
hose in Fang et al. (2013), where the first multi-dimensional rain occurred, are rather

the enforced symmetry at the midplane adopted in Xia

et al. (2012), which was relaxed (and broken by numerical discretization errors) in Fang
et al. (2013). It is still relevant to investigate which key factors (such as field strength,
effective resolutions, adopted numerical discretization) allow rain versus prominence
formation in such 2D and 8D settings. Another important finding from Fang et al.
(2013, 2015) concerns the sympathetic cooling identified in these 2D setups, where the

first blob causes local (Lore:

ntz force) perturbations on neighbouring field lines that

are close to TI, initiating condensation formation across the entire arcade. This effect
should be studied in more detail in full 3D settings, as it impacts the obtained rain

blob morphologies in as yet

incompletely understood fashion.

More recently, Li et al. (2022b) revisited the same 2D setup with randomly heated

arcades, as opposed to the

steady heating applied in Fang et al. (2013, 2015). The

improved statistics on blob widths and lengths showed that blobs with areas less than
0.5 Mm? dominated the population, obtained by counting more than 6000 individual

blobs over the simulated 10

hour period. By translating the simulations to synthetic

EUV observations, and quantifying periodicities in the lightcurves, the study showed
periods of several tens of minutes to hours, in agreement with the observations by

to corona, Antolin et al. (2022) reported the in-situ formation of rain blobs due to
TI, influenced by topological changes in the coronal field as an originally open field
line becomes closed and connected across the periodic sides. Although the heating

33
in such models is stated to be self-consistent, it is mostly due to Joule heating and
hence numerically dominated as the actual physical resistivity regime in the corona
is outside the scope of any numerical simulation. Nevertheless, it was shown how the
clump formation leads to a slightly enhanced magnetic field concentration in the blob,
leading to a fundamental field strand of transverse size (width) of around 400 km.
This is fully consistent with the findings from the chromosphere-to-corona-only studies
discussed above. The clear analysis of the basic process of TI-induced field strand
formation and how the rain blob deforms and impacts the transition region, leading
to detectable UV brightenings, augmented insights gained from the pioneering study
by Fang et al. (2015).

6.2 Flux rope models in 2.5D

While Section 6.1 focused on condensation formation in 2D arcade-like simulations, we
already mentioned that especially for realizing long-lived prominence structures, the
observations seem to indicate a preference for flux rope embedded material (Ouyang
et al. 2017). In that context, various recent models follow a formation scenario that
does not depend on evaporation-condensation, but rather on levitation-condensation
as introduced by Kaneko and Yokoyama (2015). Indeed, considering only a coronal
volume where there is no chromosphere and transition region to evaporate from, the
idea is that magnetic arcades can be deformed by systematic footpoint motions to
‘orm a flux rope (with an underlying reconnection X-point in 2.5D settings). In that
rocess, part of the lower coronal material, which is stratified and hence slightly denser,
gets lifted, and ultimately the thermodynamic conditions within the formed flux rope
ecome liable to TI/TC condensation. This leads to inverse polarity prominence types,
and creating the flux rope from an initial arcade involves converging motions, and
ossibly shearing of the arcade field as well. This levitation-condensation process was
revisited at an extremely high resolution (down to 6 km in cell sizes) by Jenkins
and Keppens (2021), where the first convincing link with linear MHD spectroscopy
findings was made. Indeed, it was found that in typical coronal settings, the flux rope
initially realizes an internal density variation that is almost constant on the nested
flux surfaces, implying that the Convective Continuum Instability from Eq. (9) will
induce thermodynamic changes on all flux surfaces where the projected Brunt-Vaisala

requency turns negative. Distinct condensations then form as a direct result of TI,
and these condensations can form throughout the flux rope. Pressure imbalances (and
gravity) ultimately cause the denser blobs to collect towards the lower dipped flux
rope part, where baroclinic considerations (unaligned density and pressure gradients)
cause further finer-scale motions. In the later stages where a monolithic prominence
resides in the dipped region, the simulation showed a clear resistive slippage across the
field, as argued for theoretically by Low et al. (2012b). Density views on the forming
prominence, during the very dynamic TI-regulated condensation and redistribution
stages are provided in Fig. 11. The same simulation was also used to demonstrate
the revolutionary multi-dimensional non-LTE radiative transfer capabilities of the
radiance cascades technique, implemented in the DexRT code (Osborne and Sannikov
2025). The fine-structured prominences as shown in Fig. 11 pose severe challenges to
multi-dimensional non-LTE post-processing, as the traditional short characteristics

34
approach suffers from artificial rays due to their finite angle coverage. At the same time,
multi-dimensional spectroscopy is needed to properly handle the shadowing effects due
to the multi-layered prominence structure.

Fig. 11 Density snapshots illustrating various stages in the formation of a prominence in a flux
rope, from Jenkins and Keppens (2021). Note how the nested flux rope surfaces clearly dictate the
dynamic redistribution of TI-induced condensations.

In many multi-dimensional MHD simulations on prominence and coronal rain
formation, the net heat-loss function £ used in equation (4) may have a heating con-
tribution at its initial time that does not exactly ensure the balance expressed in
Eq. (6). Inspired by the findings from 1D hydro loop models as discussed in Section 5,
where besides the loop shape, the imposed spatio-temporal heating is varied to trigger
different loop behavior, multi-dimensional MHD models frequently adopt a combi-
nation of a weak, vertically stratified background heating that is meant to balance
the losses, with localized (steady or stochastic) footpoint heating. In the corona-only
models from Kaneko and Yokoyama (2015); Jenkins and Keppens (2021), there is
no such footpoint heating, but only the weaker background heating to balance the
density-temperature dependent radiative losses. Starting in isothermal settings, the
heating function can just adopt the same exponential density variation we expect in
a hydrostatic setting, thereby ensuring the balance from Eq. (6) at startup. However,
observations of coronal loops have led to ‘scaling laws’, quantifying the heating that
loops experience on the basis of observable quantities like loop length, typical magnetic
field strength, and typical loop density. Therefore, a thorough 2.5D parametric survey
of the levitation-condensation scenario was performed by Brughmans et al. (2022),
to determine especially the role of different background heating prescriptions on the
prominence formation. Besides the typical exponential decay, the authors used locally
mixed prescriptions where H = ph x Bp? for varying (a, 8) combinations, and intro-
duced a new dynamic way to automatically bring in the ignored third dimension (i.e.
the ‘length’ of the loop). This latter approach implies that the field line length, which
varies from flux rope center to edge, really imposes a reduced heating within the flux
rope interior, so that an automated tracking of the flux rope shape and an accom-
panying reduction in the heating inside the flux rope is appropriate. This reduction

35
proved to allow the formation of more massive prominences, as it can trigger TI in
many more locations of the flux rope interior, which then again collect dynamically in
the bottom region of the flux rope. A visualization of the 2.5D simulation as it evolves
in the phase space of (1/p,T’) further allowed to detect both isobaric and non-isobaric
evolutionary stages in the TI-mediated condensation formation.

By making the background heating stochastic (as done first for fixed arcades in
Zhou et al. (2020)), Liakh and Keppens (2023) demonstrated that the levitation-
condensation route to prominence formation in a flux rope almost necessarily induces
prominence rotation. Indeed, such more randomized heating leads to slight left-right
asymmetries when the original arcade deforms (by converging and shearing) to the flux
rope topology. This implies that after the reconnection, net rotational motion is present
within the (coronal) flux rope interior. When then the TI manifests, we should see an
expected spin-up due to contraction during the condensation formation, in accord with
angular momentum conservation. Since asymmetric conditions and stochastic heating
are surely active throughout the solar corona, we would expect to find observational
evidence in favor of strong (order 60 km/s) rotation at early stages of prominence
formation in flux ropes. The study by Liakh and Keppens (2023) already provided
synthetic EUV impressions of the rotating prominence, while a follow-up study by
Pietrow et al. (2024) performed full non-LTE spectroscopy on the model. It was found
that the rotation should be clearly detectable in Mg II and Ly a or Ly @ spectral
lines, while H a and Ca II lines show only faintly detectable rotation signatures.

6.3 3D MHD evolutions

Fully 3D MHD models of coronal condensation formations emerged in the last decade,
and they can again be classified according to the prevailing magnetic topology, or
whether coronal-only, chromosphere-to-corona, or even sub-photosphere to corona
regions are included (see Table 1). Naturally, extensive parametric surveys of 3D mod-
els have not yet been realized. Still, many findings of the 1D and 2D surveys carry
over, especially concerning the role of parametrized (or numerically realized) heating
in evaporation-condensation settings. New with respect to the 2D or 2.5D models,
is that even from the linear MHD spectroscopy view, 3D models open up the path-
way to magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor and interchange dynamics, which is most effective
when the associated wave vector k of the perturbation can orient perpendicular to
he local magnetic field B. This is essentially prohibited in the 2D or 2.5D settings
of all models discussed thus far, but can always be achieved in 3D. The fact that
Rayleigh-Taylor dynamics and magneto-thermal convection is observed very clearly in
quiescent prominences (Berger et al. 2011), has inspired many modelers to study such
yuoyancy-driven dynamics for density contrasts representative for prominence-corona
ransitions. Examples of such studies, that go all the way to the magneto-convective
hase, are Keppens et al. (2015); Xia and Keppens (2016b); Changmai et al. (2023);
Rees-Crockford et al. (2024), while a review of Rayleigh-Taylor related insights for
prominence physics is provided in Hillier (2018). Since most of those models do
not include the actual in-situ condensation phase, they are not further discussed
here. Instead, we here review those 3D MHD works where non-eruptive prominence
structures, or sustained coronal rain events, are realized self-consistently.

Fig. 12 A synthetic EUV view oriented along the prominence spine of the model of Xia and Keppens
(2016a) (top row), compared to actual observations in the same EUV channels (bottom row).

The first successful in-situ condensation of a coherent prominence structure was
demonstrated by Xia et al. (2014). The approach taken was to initiate a full 3D MHD
simulation from chromosphere to corona, including all the relevant processes listed
in the energy equation (4), from a prior 3D isothermal MHD study where a coronal
arcade was deformed into a flux rope. The effective resolution of 460 km per cell on
the domain of 240 x 180 x 120 Mm? was modest (using three levels of automated grid
refinement), but sufficient to follow the initial mass loss when adjusting thermody-
namically to the chromosphere-to-corona settings, causing a slight uplifting of the flux
rope. This in essence realizes the coronal levitation-condensation pathway discussed
earlier (introduced by this name in the later 2.5D study of Kaneko and Yokoyama
(2015)) and triggered in-situ TI condensation. The prominence eventually settled in
the dipped portion of the flux rope, and even had a barb feature corresponding to an
earlier mass drainage at one of the prominence ends. Despite the modest resolution, the
synthetic EUV views on the prominence nicely demonstrated the appearance of a dark
coronal cavity, where the horn structures corresponded to prominence-loaded helical
field lines that separate from overlying prominence-free fields lines through the cavity.
The cavity itself is the clear signature of in-situ plasma redistribution, happening as
a result of the TI process.

37
A further leap forward was realized by Xia and Keppens (2016a), where a hig
resolution simulation realized the first fully dynamic, 3D fragmented prominence

ner-

structure. This work also succeeded in quantifying the mass circulation from chro-
mosphere to corona, where (1) individual dense prominence fragments drain into the
chromospheric reservoir; (2) a continuous plasma evaporation at the flux rope feet was
enforced; and (3) the in-situ TI process replenished the prominence mass during sev-
eral hours. Technically, the model again used a prior isothermal MHD arcade-to-flux
rope deformation, but realized a more thermodynamically relaxed full chromosphere-
to-corona model that was then in a third stage subjected to footpoint-localized heating
at both ends of the flux rope. Hence, a true evaporation-condensation scenario resulted,
where the increased effective resolution (now using four mesh levels, down to 250 km
cell sizes) allowed to form a more fine-structured prominence. Representative EUV
synthetic views are shown in the top row of Fig. 12, and can be contrasted with
actual observational counterparts shown in the bottom row. The dynamics of individ-
ual prominence fragments can be directly compared with blob dynamics of coronal
rain as studied in bipolar arcades (Fang et al. 2013, 2015).

Further 3D MHD progress was also made on coronal-only simulations, where a

higher resolution is affordable from the very start: as long as no in-situ condensations
orm, there is no transition region (which challenges modern numerical discretizations)
anywhere in the volume. Modern shock-capturing techniques, as well as advanced
algorithmic treatments of the parabolic thermal conduction and local optically thin
loss terms, can fully cope with the sudden appearance of PCTR structures as coro-
nal condensations form by in-situ TI. Kaneko and Yokoyama (2018) performed a 3D
simulation of a levitation-conde

Revisiting the same levitation-condensation scenario

achieved an unprecedented 21 km effective resolution (using four AMR levels on a 24
x 30 x 24 Mm domain). This allowed to finally resolve the scales needed to follow the
magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor process during the prominence formation phase. Producing
both filament Ha views and prominence EUV observations, this simulation could r
oncile the more thread-like on-disk views with vertically structured prominence views.
Baroclinic effects on the falling fingers in the Rayleigh-Taylor process were analysed in
detail, and the supplementary material of this publication provided quantitative links
with linear MHD spectroscopic findings, comparing all terms that contribute to (mag-
netically modified) Brunt-Vaisala frequencies. The simulation in essence reproduced
a purely coronal in-situ condensation contained in a periodic section of a flux rope,
but the obtained widths of vertical fingers and plumes compared favorably to obser-
vations. A follow-up non-LTE spectroscopic synthesis in Jenkins et al. (2023) showed
that the approximate Ha synthesis used in the original publication agreed well with a
true non-LTE treatment (albeit performed in a 1.5D sense, where individual vertical
columns are analysed separately).

38
Another coronal-only prominence formation model was put forth in Kaneko and
Yokoyama (2017), involving reconnection between adjacent arcade fields that effec-
tively doubled the length of coronal field lines in the resulting flux rope. This implied
that an in-situ TI condensation could set in, where the authors argued that the newly
formed longer field lines now exceeded the Field length. This length scale can be
deduced from a dimensional analysis on the energy balance expressed in Eq. (6), set-
ting AZ, = K(T°/?)T/n? A(T), and fieldlines with lengths exceeding this \r-limit would
be more favorable to TI-driven condensations. However, it is noted in Keppens et al.
(2025) that this length scale does not directly feature in a full eigenmode spectrum
of a (expanding) 1D loop structure. Therefore, it can only serve as a qualitative mea-
sure in comparing the stabilizing role of thermal conduction along the field lines with
the optically thin driving term of the TI. Kaneko and Yokoyama (2017) showed con-
vincing synthetic EUV views on their 3D prominence structure and its evolution, and
termed this formation process reconnection-condensation.

reconnection-condensation, as modeled by Donné and Keppens (2024). Note the Rayleigh-Taylor fin-
gering occurring in the central, reconnected flux rope region. At right, a synthetic EUV view along
the prominence axis is shown.

This reconnection-condensation, coronal-only prominence formation was revisited
recently by Donné and Keppens (2024), targeting to resolve further details by improv-
ing their 120 km cell-size to a 41 km resolution. It is to be noted that the actual
formation process is very similar to the levitation-condensation discussed earlier (and
showcased in Kaneko and Yokoyama (2015, 2018); Jenkins and Keppens (2022)), as
the double arcade system is forced to reconnect into an elongated flux rope struc-
ture by centrally converging motions, and hence the appearance of the flux rope and
the underlying reconnection are present in all these models. The condensation trigger
is due to TI/TC processes, and Donné and Keppens (2024) showed that the in-situ
catastrophic condensations lead to siphoning flows that in turn feed the prominence
with matter from the low corona. This implies that mature prominences may also form

Fig. 14 Synthetic view in two EUV AIA channels of the 3D coronal rain simulation by Lu et al.
(2024) (top panels). A space-time plot along arched field lines is shown in panel (c), while synthetic
AIA lightcurves (panel (d)) show characteristic periodicities and relative phase shifts that resemble
observations.

While Moschou et al. (2015); Xia et al. (2017) did not include the (sub)photosphere,
meanwhile more self-consistent sub-photosphere to corona models emerged as well.
This involves radiative MHD treatments that handle the corresponding optically thick-
to-thin radiative transitions properly. They realize the coronal heating by (mostly
numerically enhanced) Ohmic dissipation within convectively shuffled coronal loops.
In Kohutova et al. (2020), a dipolar region was simulated where the resulting impulsive
heating events allowed for thermal instability to set in on several field line bundles.
Compared to the studies mentioned thus far, cell resolution was about 50 km, the field
strength at coronal heights reached a higher 10 G, while the domain extended only to
14 Mm above the photosphere, restricting attention to low-lying loops. Analyzing a
selection of field lines which displayed condensations, clear parallels with 1D studies

Al
could be made in so far that asymmetric heating conditions are known to influence
TNE and TI, although also open field lines displayed condensation formation.

Finally, Lu et al. (2024) performed 3D coronal rain simulations of very extended
duration, accounting for the realistic 2000 G photospheric fields accompanying a (bipo-
lar) pair of sunspots, again from subphotosphere to corona (now up to 41 Mm above
the solar surface). This simulation recovered the full cyclic behavior of rain (as realized
earlier in 2D settings in Fang et al. (2015); Li et al. (2022b)) by covering almost half a
day of physical time. Synthetic EUV views in multiple channels recovered periodicities
and also relative temporal shifts, fully consistent with the observations (Auchére et al.
2018), as demonstrated in Fig. 14. Using the linear TI criteria, the spatio-temporally
varying location of all rain blobs matched well with predicted instability sites.

It will be of interest to conduct more full 3D, extended duration simulations, for
conditions from more quiescent to active region magnetic fields and simple to complex
topologies, allowing to make a clearer link with observational findings on the shape
and lifetime of coronal rain showers (Sahin and Antolin 2022; Sahin et al. 2023).

6.4 Erupting prominences

While all model efforts discussed thus far greatly advanced our understanding of how
prominences and rain blobs form, they all focused on magnetic topologies that stayed
quasi-steady while condensations evolved. At the same time, the most spectacular
views on prominences are obtained during eruptions. While there are countless efforts
to model the initiation and evolution of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and how they
in turn relate to linear MHD criteria (Keppens et al. 2019), prominence matter (which
makes up most of the ejected material) is rarely included. Here, we briefly summarize
models where self-consistently formed prominences appear within actual eruptions.

In Linker et al. (2001), a 2.5D axisymmetric simulation was presented where promi-
nence formation by levitation occurred within a helmet streamer. In a spherical domain
that starts at the top of the chromosphere, a boundary-controlled shear flow is acting
within the helmet streamer, which subsequently changes to a flux reduction by con-
trolling the boundary tangential electric field. In this part of the evolution, a flux rope
forms that lifts chromospheric matter to coronal heights. Depending on the amount
of flux reduction, the flux rope with filament can erupt or remain stably suspended.

In Zhao et al. (2017), a Cartesian 2.5D simulation from chromosphere to high
corona (up to 250 Mm) follows what happens when an initial linear force-free arcade
gets deformed into an (erupting) flux rope by imposing converging motions at its
base. Using up to 7 adaptive grid levels, details down to 24 km could be resolved,
while the resulting magnetic reconnection was mitigated by the included resistive
MHD effects. As the flux rope forms, it levitates chromospheric material, and this
originally chromospheric matter became trapped in the erupting flux rope as a mature
prominence. Height-time traces of the path followed by the flux rope and the embedded
prominence matched closely, while dynamical aspects (such as plasmoid formation) in
the current sheet forming between the erupting flux rope and the lower-lying flare loop
system could be identified. Indeed, such mesoscale details arise when islands merge
into the flux rope, disturbing the erupting prominence with internal fast shocks (Zhao
and Keppens 2020).

42
A related study by Zhao and Keppens (2022) introduced a novel ‘plasmoid-fec
prominence formation’ (or PF?) scenario that actively relies on plasmoid-mediatec
dynamics to make a prominence appear and erupt. Instead of actively deforming an
arcade as done in Zhao et al. (2017), the initial condition starts from a flux rope that:
is in a catastrophe state, where the possibility for a steady equilibrium is lost. Catas-
trophe pathways to CMEs are studied frequently in MHD modeling, but Zhao anc
Keppens (2022) showed that the current sheet forming underneath the erupting flux
rope can collect chromospheric matter into it, and when the current sheet thins anc
becomes plasmoid unstable, the cool and dense chromospheric matter can get trappec
within individual plasmoids. The upwards traveling ones then act to feed the bottom
of the eruption with seed prominence matter, further augmented with sympathetic in-
situ TI condensations. The main aspect of this PF? model is its intrinsically threadec
and fine-structured nature of the erupting prominence, where details of reconnection,
tearing and thermal instabilities all interplay. Future work should look at full 3D
realizations of this erupting prominence pathway, and observations may well identify
specific signatures of this form-while-erupt scenario, as opposed to prominences that
live quietly for extended periods of time, and suddenly get ejected.

Full 3D, but corona-only, simulations of erupting prominences were pioneered in
Fan (2017), where a spherical domain extended up to 11 solar radii. The initial state
focuses on a helmet streamer located between radially stretched field lines that con-
tain ambient solar wind, and the lower boundary emerges a twisted flux rope structure
within the helmet streamer. The lower boundary treatment mimicked the behavior of
a transition region where evaporation could happen, by driving the base pressure in
a prescribed e-folding time to the one consistent with the conductive heat flux. This

43
rescription introduced some heuristic parameters, which could be tuned to result
in runaway cooling and prominence formation (TI induced condensations), while the
wisted rope deforms and erupts (due to linear MHD kink instability). Fan (2018)
made further detailed comparisons between cases with and without prominence for-
mation, highlighting how non-force-free the magnetic field is when cool material is
resent, and how the drainage of filament matter can aid in speeding up the final
eruption. Synthetic EUV SDO/AIA views for prominences (Fan and Liu 2019) along
he flux rope axis clearly resembled observations (with prominence horns enclosing the
cavity, much like those discussed in Xia et al. (2014)). Further follow-up simulations
y Fan (2020) combined the form-and-erupt scenario to one where large-amplitude
longitudinal oscillations of the 3D prominence structure were initiated as well. They
‘ound a negligible effect of those (damped) oscillatory motions on the 3D eruption and
drainage.

Most recently, Xing et al. (2025) presented a 3D chromosphere-to-corona simulation
of a CME event where shearing and converging footpoint driving forms a flux rope
in a 3D Cartesian box, where a mature filament forms from levitating chromospheric
matter. A splitting is observed in both the magnetic and filament topology shortly
before the eruption, while the drainage of filament mass drives the slow rise phase of
the CME event. A synthetic view on the eruption is shown in Fig. 15, where the bottom
left row (¢ = 92 view) indicates the split in an erupting and a low-lying filament.

Efforts to model erupting prominences are very timely, since they are now exten-
sively observed by the Metis coronagraph onboard of Solar Orbiter mission, as e.g.
demonstrated in Russano et al. (2024). Metis can follow eruptions at distances up to
10 solar radii, and combines first time imaging in the ultraviolet H-I Ly-a line with
polarized white light, yielding unique plasma diagnostics. Noteworthy in that respect
is the work by Dion et al. (2025), presenting a parametric survey of 2.5D CME events
as triggered by a combination of converging-shearing footpoint motions in an initial
arcade setup. The study covers cases without and with eventual eruptions, but all have
self-consistently formed prominences due to thermal instability. Dion et al. (2025) find
that erupting prominences may evaporate in situ due to Ohmic heating occuring at
localized current concentrations, and that tearing and plasmoids on the current sheet
underneath the erupting, prominence-carrying flux rope can contribute to the internal
fine structure of observed CMEs.

6.5 Other topologies and condensation formation pathways

Most models discussed thus far consider traditional arcade or flux rope evolutions,
which represent closed field topologies with both ends anchored to the photosphere.
The main physical process behind the thermal instability (a delicate interplay between
heating and cooling under a coronal-specific radiative-loss prescription) is somewhat
indifferent to the magnetic topology: local runaway condensation formation may hap-
pen also in open field regions. While recent 1D hydro models (Scott et al. 2024)
indeed confirm this possibility, multi-dimensional realizations of this process are called
for, where especially the transition zone between open and closed field lines should
be investigated in highly resolved MHD simulations. From the linear MHD spec-
troscopic viewpoint, these regions bring all ingredients for rich dynamics together:

44
current sheets (tearing), shear flow (Kelvin-Helmholtz), changing radiative loss effects,
thermodynamic and heating prescriptions, ...

In that context, the 2D axisymmetric study by Schlenker et al. (2021) already
realizes TNE cycles and associated rain in a streamer plus solar wind setup, where
the (turbulent) consequences of the TI/TC condensation formation within the closed
helmet structure can also be traced beyond its tip. The simulation adopts a total
heating prescription that splits into two exponential functions that serve as a (weaker)
background and as a footpoint heating source, respectively. Numerical challenges are
relaxed by artificially breaking the symmetry in the equatorially located streamer,
and by forcing a high temperature (10° K) chromosphere boundary to act as a mass
reservoir for wind and streamer zone. Increasing the resolution (1024? on a radially
stretched 30 Ro domain) showed a clear tendency for changing from bursty rain
ormation to a more continuous, smaller-scale rain manifestation. Synthetic Doppler
maps looking down on the streamer show speed variations that reflect the falling rain
as well as the chromospheric evaporations, and clearly locate at the streamer periphery,
in accord with observations. Further work should clarify the role of condensation
formation, the role of interchange reconnection, and the possibility to have combined
earing and TI/TC instabilities (as in Sen and Keppens (2022); Sen et al. (2023); De
Jonghe and Sen (2025)) at these open/closed field boundaries, on the acceleration and
internal variability of the (slow) solar wind.

That interesting thermodynamic evolutions can appear in more realistic, complex
opologies was observationally established by Mason et al. (2019), where rain was wit-
nessed in the typical spine-fan topology of a parasitic dipole within a unipolar region.
This involves a coronal null point, and in three separate active regions characterized
by this topology, rain appeared not only on the closed loops inside the fan, but also
near the separatrices (spines and fan, and near the null). It was suggested that both
interchange reconnection and thermal non-equilibrium (with the basic underlying TI
rocess) should be at play in such settings. That reconnection itself can act as a trig-
ger for TI condensations was observed by Kohutova et al. (2019). It was shown that
reconnection between a (prominence-carrying) flux rope and surrounding coronal field
ed to impulsive heating in the higher coronal loop regions. This observation supports
he emerging view that TI can develop anywhere in the corona, provided some trig-
ger mechanism brings the region into local runaway conditions. Hence, exclusively
‘ootpoint-located heating is not a necessary ingredient, although it is known to aid in
condensation formation.

A first numerical demonstration of this reconnection-induced rain pathway was
recently presented in Popescu Braileanu and Keppens (2025), where a two-fluid
(plasma-neutral) coronal-only model of a spine-fan topology was found to develop rain.
Although gravity was not incorporated in the study, the reconnection enforced by a
bottom boundary driving was sufficient to trigger higher density seeds that became
TI unstable. The two-fluid effects included ionization and recombination process
with local velocity decoupling effects at play. Interestingly, compared to the earlier
MHD simulations of rain as triggered by evaporation-condensation, the actual rain
formation was acting much faster in this reconnection-triggered pathway. It would be
valuable to perform these 3D spine-fan studies in two complementary ways: (1) in the

tion processes are suppressed; and (2) in more realistically stratified chromosphere to
coronal settings, with full multi-dimensional MHD thermodynamic effects.

As an example of the latter, Li et al. (2025) studied flux-emergence in a 2.5D
chromosphere to coronal simulation, varying the main parameters of the emerg-
ing field region. This can lead to plasmoid-forming current sheets bounding the
emergence region, where multithermal jets and filaments could form and evolve in self-
consistent evolutions. Depending on the orientation of the emerged field, a particular
emergence-driven prominence formation scenario was identified where Rayleigh-Taylor
and Kelvin-Helmholtz related fine structure can result. Indeed, by locally emerging
field that is oriented orthogonal to the original dipolar arcade, one can form a fila-
ment channel, and it was shown that repeated reconnection below the forming flux

46
rope can bring in cool matter in bursts, that collects as a rising prominence. This is
shown in the time-distance views of Fig. 16, where the vertical height variation is ori-
ented along the slanted current sheet underneath the flux rope. This flux-emergence
driven prominence scenario should again be revisited in full 3D settings, where the
repeated injection of chromospheric matter due to reconnection is expected to lead to
interesting thread-like morphologies.

7 Postflare rain

As mentioned in our introductory Section 1, a rather spectacular demonstration of
multiphase dynamics with spontaneous condensations forming is witnessed in associ-
ation with solar flares. Mason and Kniezewski (2022) analysed 241 flares, and thereby
discovered a positive correlation between GOES flare class (i.e. energy released) and
the duration of postflare rain events. In accord with Svestka (2007), we note that
reconnected lower-lying loops are an integral part of the entire eruptive flare loop sys-
tem, and should not be termed ‘postflare’ loops, but we adhere to calling rain that may
develop after the initial phase as postflare. Jing et al. (2016) used the adaptive optics
at the Goode Solar Telescope at Big Bear to showcase unprecedented fine structure
during an M-class flare, where the high cadence (28 s) Ha views presented intricate
details of flare ribbons, reconnected flare loops refilled with chromospheric material
and postflare coronal rain. Brightenings associated with rain clumps impacting the
chromosphere could be identified, and individual rain strands with cross-sections of
about 100 km (see Fig. 17) were found throughout.

By analysing IRIS-spectra and EUV images, Sahin and Antolin (2024) investigated
the mass and energy cycle in a C2.1 flare, where phases of chromospheric evaporation
and coronal rain could be clearly identified, throughout the evolving flare. Rain quan-
tity and intensity was found to increase by factors from three to six, when comparing
preflare to gradual flare phases.

This postflare rain poses context-specific challenges to modelers, where
reconnection-based energy release causes multi-million degree plasma to ultimately
transform into chromospheric condensations and sometimes postflare rain is already
observed from the peak of the impulsive phase onwards. In the many 1D hydro models
discussed in Section 5, footpoint located heating acts favorably to induce TI driven
condensations, but significant flare loop thermodynamics in the standard flare model
results from energy transport down from the reconnection site to the chromosphere
due to non-thermal particle beams. The lighter electrons are usually invoked in this
process, but analytic models for both electrons and protons that collisionally interact
with a cold hydrogen target (the chromosphere) exist (Emslie 1978), and they quantify
the energy deposition rate as a function of column depth. The parameters involved
are then setting the injected electron beam flux spectrum (with a cut-off and a spec-
tral index). These beams are accelerated at the reconnection site by kinetic processes
beyond the usual MHD models, then guided by the magnetic fields, making the beams
penetrate and heat the chromosphere. This causes chromospheric evaporation which
rapidly refills flare loops with denser matter, as these beams act for few minutes at
most.

The six panels (b,c,d,e,f,g) on the right quantify intensity variations across indicated slits on the
arched loops, allowing to quantify rain strand widths around 100 km. From Jing et al. (2016).

In Reep et al. (2020), 1D hydrodynamic models of beam-injected flare loops that
incorporate radiative losses with non-equilibrium ionization effects, thermal conduc-
tion and account for area expansion of the loop, provided a rather negative answer: it
was impossible to get rain condensation under typical parameters for flare loop sys-
tems. The model parameters changed both the loop geometry as well as the electron
beam parameters (such as duration and energy cut-off). When a secondary weak foot-
point heating (besides the beam-driven effects) was added, rain condensations could
occur. Again focusing on short, hot loops impacted by impulsive electron beam heat-
ing, Reep et al. (2022) varied the area expansion factors, and studied changes from
semi-circular to elliptic loop shapes. The 1D assumption still implies that the loop
shape only enters as a projected gravity as explained in Section 5, but a puzzling
finding was the lack of postflare coronal rain formation throughout all models explored.

A novel ingredient in the 1D radiative hydro models of impulsively heated (due to
electron beams) flare loops is the incorporation of spatio-temporally varying elemental
abundances. Chromospheric evaporation shifts the local abundances, and changes the
local heat-loss effects. It was shown in Benavitz et al. (2025) that this ingredient
suffices to cause rain condensations in impulsively heated or flare loops. By enriching
the 1D hydro model with a continuity (advection) equation for the spatiotemporal
abundance of the low first-ionization potential (low-FIP, where low is below 10 eV, like
Fe, Si, Mg) elements, and incorporating this factor in the cooling curve prescription,

48
one could trigger rain where earlier models failed. Reep et al. (2025) followed this up
with further 1D simulations, suggesting that the occurence of postflare coronal rain
and the initial location of assumed low-FIP enhancements that get advected into the
loop may well be correlated. We note that these works concentrated on the normal
FIP effect under solar flare conditions, while observations also identified a reverse FIP
effect in flares (Laming 2021).

Fig. 18 Synthetic EUV views on postflare rain arcades demonstrate how hot loops may temporarily
disappear from view, due to rain triggered on neighboring arcade fieldlines. The rain (and the chro-
mospheric) matter is indicated in blue. From Ruan et al. (2021).

While these 1D models focus on more advanced physical ingredients accompanying
chromosphere to coronal conditions in flare loops, various multi-dimensional MHD
models emerged that do produce postflare rain due to thermal instability. By following
a standard 2.5D flare model (involving an initial vertical current sheet) from the
preflare, through the impulsive and into the gradual phase, Ruan et al. (2021) showed
postflare rain appearing in two consecutive episodes that both lasted about 15-20
minutes. The rain formed about half an hour after the impulsive phase, and these
MHD models did not include any non-thermal beams that act to transport energy
rapidly and non-locally. An interesting multi-dimensional finding was that coronal rain
formation on neighboring loops could cause hot, bright loops (as visible in EUV) to
temporarily disappear from view, until these loops in turn refilled. This is illustrated in
Fig. 18. The flare loop refilling in these models is due to wave and plasma reflections on

the transition region, as well as due to thermal conduction. Also Lorentz forces enter,
as loops contract or expand in an overall non-force-free evolution. Future models must,

49
combine the insights of 1D beam models into such multi-dimensional flare evolutions,
as already achieved for the purely impulsive flare phases in Ruan et al. (2020); Druett
et al. (2023, 2024). We note that the non-local feedback of parametrized non-thermal
electron beams in these self-consistent multi-dimensional mo

rain events happen on higher loops, and cool dense matter follows the loop shapes closely. Bottom
panels show selected field lines, the temperature variation (in color) and temperature isocontours (in

Recently, the modeling for postflare rain progressed to a full 3D MHD model by
Ruan et al. (2024), who followed the standard flare from onset to decay, producing
postflare rain that closely matches several aspects of observed counterparts. In stan-
dard flare settings, a vertical current sheet is combined with an anomalous resistivity
prescription, that triggers reconnection and realizes the flare loop formation. With the
model atmosphere spanning from chromosphere to corona, the impact of reconnection
downflows on the flare arcade induces Kelvin-Helmholtz turbulence in the loop tops
during the impulsive phase (Ruan et al. 2023), that can be followed by Richtmeyer-
Meshkov instabilities near and below the termination shock (Shen et al. 2022). Ruan
et al. (2023) demonstrated that the (impulsive phase) loop top turbulence in the model
is in perfect agreement with nonthermal velocity distributions inferred from Hinode
EUV-Imaging Spectroscopy. The Richtmeyer-Meshkov deformations relate to supra-
arcade downflows. The flare loop system is found to realize a non-force-free magnetic
topology in the entire gradual phase, where the vertical plasma pressure variation
combines to an overall force-balanced state (Ruan et al. 2024). In that non-force-
free setting, Rayleigh-Taylor turbulence develops throughout the loop top and current:
sheet regions. All these processes ultimately create the right conditions for TI runaway
condensations in the refilled flare loops, again relatively late in the gradual phase.
Fig. 19 shows synthetic EUV views, and temperature isocontour views, to show field-
guided condensations raining down the loops at observed speeds and morphologies.
Note how rain is seen in isocontours of temperature to follow the arched loop shapes,
and how later rain events manifest on higher lying loops. When compared to Fig. 17,
here is finer detail with more strands visible in the observational Ha views. Sahin
and Antolin (2024) made a detailed observational analysis of the role of chromospheric
evaporation and postflare rain to the energy cycle of a C-class flare, and used total
pressure equilibrium to deduce the flare loop magnetic field strengths during impul-
sive and gradual phases, finding a decrease from 24 to 11 Gauss, rather similar to the
3D Ruan et al. (2024) model.

In summary, while we currently do have both 1D and multi-D numerical mani-
festations of postflare rain, further insights are expected when combining their key
ingredients: the role of non-local energy depositions by beams must still be included
in multi-D postflare rain simulations, while the sophisticated 1D models now point
o abundance effects as key to get postflare rain in impulsively heated loops. The
multi-dimensional models so far only develop rain with a clear delay beyond the impul-
sive phase, and poses challenges to observed events with rain observed a few minutes
eyond the peak. This should be investigated across flare classes, in simulations that
handle both beams and evolving abundances in 2D and 3D setups.

8 Beyond solar condensations

The basic mechanism of thermal instability was recognized from the start to be univer-
sally applicable (Parker 1953; Field 1965; Balbus 1986; Waters and Proga 2019; Falle
et al. 2020; Keppens et al. 2025), capable of explaining condensation formation with-
out invoking self-gravity. The gas dynamic HD and ideal MHD equations are also fully
scale-invariant (Goedbloed et al. 2019), and hence can be applied to many different
astrophysical contexts. Here, we highlight some examples of condensation formation
models that closely relate to the solar case, where very similar numerical HD or MHD
approaches were used.

Exoplanet survey missions like Kepler and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satel-
ite (TESS) also boosted research on stellar flares, where optical stellar flare lightcurves
show strong similarities (usually an impulsive phase with gradual decay) with the solar
case. Superflares on M dwarf stars have inferred energies above 10°” ergs, and a good
raction of those has a highly impulsive peak followed by a second, more Gaussian
eak. In Yang et al. (2023), 1D hydro simulations of flare loop dynamics in fixed-shape
semi-circular loops were performed, where flare energy injections act as localized, time-
dependent heating sources at loop apex and footpoints. Postflare loop condensations
ormed due to thermal instability. The gradual phase was analyzed by translating
he obtained thermodynamic evolution to an optical light curve, assuming optically
hin (free-free and free-bound) continuum emission from fully ionized plasma from the
coronal part of an off-limb flare loop. The postflare coronal rain condensations were
shown to lead to a pronounced secondary peak, consistent with the late phase stellar
flares observed by TESS. In Wollmann et al. (2023), Ha spectral line asymmetries in
a stellar flare for the dMe star AD Leo were explained by non-LTE radiative trans-
er computations for rain clouds in free fall along a fixed arcade, and synthetic line
rofiles are consistent with the observed 50 kms~! red wing enhancements, signaling
downflows.
Peng and Matsumoto (2017) presented a 2.5D MHD simulation of the formation
of a galactic prominence, which closely follows the levitation-condensation model from
Kaneko and Yokoyama (2015). What differs is the scale of the setup (a domain of
order 400 x 400 pe?), the time scale of the evolution (following the evolution for
20 My), as well as the typical thermodynamic conditions. The latter also imply a
different cooling curve that recognizes that matter in the galactic central region can
e in two stable states: a cold neutral medium (order 10-100 K) or a warm neutral
medium (around 10+ K), with a thermally unstable regime in between. In all other
respects, the simulation is performed like the solar case, where an initial arcade gets
deformed by footpoint motions to a flux rope, that rises and forms a prominence by
hermal instability. After the levitation-condensation process, the simulated galactic
rominence was a monolithic structure of about 60 pc vertically, and 7 pc in width,
making it of order 7 x 104 Mo in mass. This structure could be related to observations
of molecular loops in the central galactic region. A detailed study of the observational
roperties of these galactic loops is found e.g. in Torii et al. (2010).

Motivated by cool star surveys studying Ha asymmetries that indicate the pres-
ence of moving, cool dense matter in their surroundings, Daley-Yates et al. (2023)
roduced a model of coronal rain on a young sun. The solar rotation rate (and the
ypical coronal magnetic field) was originally much higher than its present value, since
solar wind mediated angular momentum loss occurred throughout its main sequence
ifetime. Adopting a solar rotation period of 1 day, and a polar field strength of 100
G, one encounters new numerical challenges to model the solar atmosphere and wind
under such conditions. This is best done in the co-rotating frame (introducing cen-
rifugal and Coriolis forces), and by solving equivalent nonlinear equations that split

off the strong dipole magnetic field. With the necessary ingredients of heat-loss in the
energy equation, it was found that coronal rain could again develop within the closed
field regions, with downflow speeds that agree with the ones in spectral Ha line asym-
metries. Quasi-periodic behavior (rain cycles) could be identified, with periods of 37
hours, somewhat longer than those known for the present solar case.

ing, strongly magnetized solar-type star. The corotation radius is indicated in white dashes, the
magnetic field lines are shown, and a single centrifugal ejection event is shown at different epochs.
From Daley-Yates et al. (2023).

The same Ha profiles from stellar coronae also revealed the possibility of so-called
slingshot prominences, which could be located near the co-rotation radius where a

53
balance between centrifugal forces and gravity occurs, and then get ejected. Daley-
Yates and Jardine (2024) simulated what happens in rotating, highly magnetized
stellar atmospheres and winds, this time confronting a case with a 0.38 day versus a
3.8 day rotation period. They correspondingly adjusted the magnetic field strength
and the overall heating and radiative loss prescriptions. As shown in Fig. 20, the
aster rotating, centrifugal magnetosphere shows condensation formation near the co-
rotation radius (at roughly 2 stellar radii) where the part forming beyond this radius
gets centrifugally ejected. The equatorial current sheet where also the condensation
resides then tears and plasmoids get ejected and merge. These ejections could be
followed up to the domain size of 50 stellar radii (double that shown in Fig. 20).
During the simulated episode of nearly 400 hours, the simulation demonstrated about
8 of these slingshot prominences, going out at a typical 813 km/s. Compared with the
ower rotation rate (longer period) cases, which formed more rain-like events without
oreakouts, these centrifugal regimes with slingshot prominence ejections are important
when quantifying stellar mass loss rates and may impact stellar rotational evolution
hrough modified angular momentum loss rates. Both regimes (slow and fast rotating
solar-type stars) rely on thermal instability to trigger the in-situ condensations.
Finally, we note that many studies exist in the context of multiphase matter for-
mation and evolution in the interstellar (ISM) to intergalactic medium (IGM), or
even in the intercluster medium (ICM). These studies routinely invoke TI to explain
how cool, dense matter can form in-situ (e.g. Sharma et al. 2012) and usually feature
background flows representing outflow (winds) or accretion configurations.

9 Open problems and challenges

We end this review by listing a number of challenges that persist when modeling
condensation formation in the solar atmosphere (or in related astrophysical) settings.
It thereby remains imperative for modelers to confront observations of coronal rain and
prominences in an even more quantitative fashion, e.g. by means of synthetic spectra in
multiple wavebands, in direct correspondence with existing instrument specifications.

e While high-resolution numerical models do reveal aspects of the (observed) fine-
structure in prominences that form inside flux ropes, it is unexplored how much of
this fine-structure is encoded in its spectrum of linear normal (eigen)modes, which
can host global as well as ultra-localized thermal instabilities from the thermal con-
tinuum (Keppens et al. 2025). The link between spectral theory where eigenmodes
can be computed exactly, versus detailed linear as well as nonlinear evolutions from
given initial conditions, is particularly relevant for prominence and coronal rain stud-
ies, since they share the common physical origin of radiatively driven runaway. How
such eigenmode-based insights connect to the findings in 1D hydro ‘loop’ settings,
where varying field line geometry, parametrized heating and radiative loss curve
selection revealed cyclic behavior with and without condensation formation (ther-
mal non-equilibrium) is part of ongoing research. There, we can benefit from model
efforts on multiphase behavior in interstellar, circumgalactic or intercluster medium,
where TI is known to drive cold filaments forming out of the hot phase (Sharma
et al. 2012). The major difference in a solar setting is the intricate thermodynamic

coupling between chromosphere and corona across a pre-existing transition region,
and the energy and mass cycling between these regions. These solar-specific cou-

plings have been explored extensive:

¢ The role of partial ionization on condensation onset and evolution is only studied so
far in simplified settings: the first 1D plasma-neutral model of prominence forma-

the 3D two-fluid setup to trigger coronal rain of Popescu Braileanu and Keppens
(2025) did not include gravity, but did include important ionization and recombina-
tion aspects. Multi-dimensional setups are needed to explore how partial ionization,
recombination, as well as realistic stratification all impact condensation formation.
Decoupling effects for coronal rain blobs have been studied for initially inserted den-
sity structures in a simple stratified medium, such as in 1D settings by Oliver et al.
(2016) or in 2D by Martinez-Gomez et al. (2022). Collisional interactions play a
role in secondary structure formation when RTI development is followed from initial
density inversions (Popescu Braileanu et al. 2021), but these effects are localized at
thin edges of RTI plumes and are likely beyond observational limits. Nevertheless,
the PCTR variation implies important changes in collisional frequencies, that surely
impact the physical evolutions.
¢ Multi-dimensional MHD models must still improve on the way in which important
net radiative cooling effects impact condensations and their internal structuring, as
identified by 1D non-LTE radiative transfer treatments of idealized (isobaric and
isothermal) prominence slabs. Recently, Gunar et al. (2025) tabulated net radiative
cooling rates (or NRCRs), as well as electron density and ionization degrees, for vox-

els that are aware of their location with respect to illumination sources, in particular
differentiating between vertical, horizontal bottom or horizontal top bounding sur-
faces. These tables provide a significant update to early efforts by Kuin and Poland
(1991). Knowing the distance into the condensation from the bounding surface, as
well as the local pressure and temperature, these NRCRs quantify the full opti-
cally thin to thick radiative transfer effects in a consistent fashion, and could be

used as local source terms in numerical simulations which spontaneously develop
and evolve radiatively driven condensations. These NRCRs can modify the internal
temperature structure of each individual rain blob or larger-scale prominence, but
it will be non-trivial to make clear choices between the given three bounding sur-
face orientations at each numerical grid cell, as e.g. Rayleigh-Taylor deformations
lead to strongly curved boundaries, and shadowing effects when neighboring blobs

appear are not easily incorporated. Nevertheless, non-LTE net heating-cooling is
known to affect all cool plasma embedded within the corona, especially for temper-
atures below 30000 K, such as present in spicules, cool jets or coronal loops and in
prominence and rain settings. A recent review and discussion is provided in Heinzel
et al. (2025). Improving the details of non-LTE processes may lead to more physi-
cally motivated internal (low) temperature values in condensations. Temperatures

as low as 2000 K for coronal rain blobs were inferred observationally in Antolin
et al. (2015), to be contrasted with even lower quiet sun chromosphere locations
identified in 2D radiative MHD simulations (Leenaarts et al. 2011).

© We do not yet fully understand how the heating-cooling balance dictates the detailed
thermodynamical evolutions in loops or open field line structures. It is certain that
the presence of coronal rain and the morphology of filaments and prominences some-

how encodes information on this balance, and the models thus far suggest that we
can trigger condensation formation in almost any magnetic topology. The 1D hydro
models do narrow down the search for the most important physical ingredients, with
e.g. the role of footpoint heating as agreed in most models, or of elemental abun-
dances (Benavitz et al. 2025) seemingly crucial for postflare rain condensations.
Stepping to multi-dimensional settings, with actual MHD dynamics both along and
across the loop diameter, can drastically modify findings based on 1D loop models
alone, as e.g. postflare rain was succesfully modeled in 2D and 3D flare loop setups
(Ruan et al. 2021, 2024), while 1D models fail unless abundance variations are incor-
porated. That coronal rain, in quiescent or flare settings, is so similar to filaments
and prominences, agrees with the basic thermal instability mechanism acting uni-
versally to explain in-situ condensations, even in other astrophysical settings. How
it triggers rather different fine-structure according to the magnetic topology or heat-
ing prescription is as yet an open question. In that context, we need model efforts
like Mok et al. (2016), where detailed active region evolutions that showed coronal
rain were translated to synthetic EUV observations. These efforts already showed
encouraging correspondence with actual observations showing clear non-equilibrium
(i.e. non-steady) thermal evolutions.

¢ Most models we discussed here do not include sub-photospheric regions, which will
obviously impact the chromospheric to coronal responses. A preview on a compre-
hensive simulation of a solar prominence that forms by a combination of injection
and in-situ condensation is shown in Fig. 21, where a bipolar arcade is evolved from
subphotosphere to corona. A seed cool plasma parcel is injected in a pre-existing
magnetic dip, due to underlying convective processes, and then feeds further conden-
sation formation. Such models, and the role of more sophisticated radiative processes
from optically thick to thin (occurring across the unit optical depth surface T5099 = 1
for wavelengths at 500 nm as indicated in Fig. 21) are urgently needed.

¢ Further model efforts should try and follow the entire life cycle of filaments, inclu
ing formation, internal dynamics, and eventual disappearance. This is perhaps best
achieved in a data-driven approach, based on detailed observations. This may use
observed magnetogram evolutions as bottom boundary information, much like the
one simulated in Fig. 3, but then including all thermodynamic processes. Efforts
have been done for global solar models using magnetofrictional evolutions (Mackay
and Upton 2022), and one may perhaps at first combine such global magnetic field
quantifications with follow-up frozen-field hydro simulations (from Section 5.3), to
get filament matter included. Also in simulations where prominences get ejected,
we are as yet missing important details on the thermodynamic fine-structure, with
observations showing many falling filament fragments that impact chromospheric
layers. Whether prominence drainage differs from dynamics observed in coronal rain
settings is an open question. It is also worth noting that current space weather fore-
casting frameworks (such as Baratashwili et al. (2025)), which use simplified models
to represent the ejecta, ly ignore the presence of cool matter alltogether, and
incorporating the details of prominences and rain in them may well be needed for
more accurate predictions on their geo-effectiveness. Surely, inclusion of multither-
mal matter could play a role in the initial trigger to unstable and erupting evolutions.
Observational findings on coronal rain as a trigger to prominence instability and
resulting CMEs are collected in Vashalomidze et al. (2022).

In the end, our numerical resolutions should at least challenge or excee
tional ones, in order to make further modeling progress or even predict novel
features. In that respect, the recent breakthrough in the use of adaptive
make observations near or at the solar limb (Schmidt et al. 2025) is quite
ing, revealing finer scale details in coronal rain or in prominence dynamics
reported (better than 70 km or 0.1 arcsec). Schmidt et al. (2025) show postflare loop
rands at the diffraction limit (of 64 km, implying that native strand widths could
have been down to 10 km or less), plasmoid features that strongly evolved within
minutes, and prominence and coronal rain details that are missed in current state-of-
he-art models. Barczynski et al. (2025) shows that coordinated observations between
Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) and Solar Orbiter offer a wealth of observa-

rich possibilities offered by interacting MHD waves and instabilities in gravitation-
ally stratified, radiating, magnetically structured solar and stellar atmospheres are
undoubtedly used by nature, and continue to form the inspiration for theoretical and
numerical researchers.
