Photon counting statistics are explored, theoretically, from a pair of cavity modes coupled to the
fluorescent transitions in a strongly-driven two-level atom. We show that the cavity modes acquire
nonclassical photon statistics that are representative of dressed-state picture atomic transitions. In
particular, the modes are shown to be antibunched, while simultaneously having a cross-correlation
value greater than unity. Furthermore, we propose an implementation of the system with a nanofiber
cavity QED system, based on a strongly-driven cesium atom.

I. INTRODUCTION

Interactions between light and two-level systems have
een studied since the very early days of quantum op-
ics. Despite their simplicity, they exhibit a remarkable
range of physical phenomena. In the regime of weak
coherent driving, the need for an atomic re-excitation
rocess imposes a temporal separation between succes-
sively emitted photons, hence the antibunched photon
counting statistics of resonance fluorescence [I] [2]. How-
ever, a strong incident field dresses the bare states into
a ladder of doublets; the emission spectrum splits into a
hree-peaked structure known as the Mollow triplet [3}5).
n the dressed-state interpretation, the three peaks arise
from distinct transitions between eigenstates of the quan-
ized resonance fluorescence Hamiltonian, which have
oth atomic and photonic characteristics [6].
The persistence of whole-field antibunching in the
rong-driving limit is explained as an interference effect
etween different transition pathways [7]. Isolating spe-
cific components of the emitted field unveils properties
of the dressed state transitions that manifest themselves
as frequency-dependent photon correlations The cor-
relation structure can be explored by spectrally filter-
ing the emitted field, and shows potential for developing
rongly-correlated photon sources [9}II]. Furthermore,
ne nuanced correlation structure has shown promise for
he generation of photonic Bell states [12] [13].

Beyond free-space resonance fluorescence, the inter-
action can be enhanced and modified by coupling to a
near-resonant cavity mode. In the Purcell regime, this
can enhance the atomic emission rate whilst retaining
he spectral structure, enabling rapid production of pho-
onic Bell states [14]. Coupling a specific dressed-state
ransition to a cavity mode has been shown to affect

ut the triplet structure is

he width and relative prominence of the emission peaks,

still retained [15] [16]. How-

ling to an independent pair

of cavity modes, one centered on each sideband of the
Mollow triplet, has not previously been studied. This is
partly due to resonators tending to rely on an extremely
short length to elicit a strong atom-light coupling, giv-
ing a correspondingly large free spectral range (FSR). On
the contrary, nanofiber-based cavities are typically much
longer, with the strong coupling arising from extreme
transverse field confinement in the tapered nanofiber sec-
tion [17) [18]. These cavities therefore can have a smaller
FSR [19], comparable in scale to the sideband splittings
that have been demonstrated with an alkali atom [20].
Conceivably, nanofiber cavities can be engineered such
that an adjacent pair of frequency-resolved cavity modes
are resonant at each of the Mollow fluorescence frequen-
cies, and thereby simultaneously interact with the same
atom. One then might expect the output from each of
these modes to be representative of, or related to, the
photon statistics for the relevant peaks of the Mollow
spectrum. In this paper, we consider exactly this sce-
nario: coupling a strongly-driven two-level atom to a pair
of cavity modes, to explore the photon correlations that
arise.

The paper is organized as follows. First, in Section [IT]
we briefly introduce the Mollow spectrum, describe the
atom-cavity system, and discuss the calculation of sta-
tistical properties of the fields. In Section [I] we con-
sider an idealized model of a strongly-driven two-level
atom interacting with an adjacent pair of cavity modes,
to unveil the expected photon statistics for the respec-
tive cavity modes and understand the dependence on the
interaction parameters. In Section we describe and
numerically integrate a model of a *¥Cs atom, coherently
driven and coupled to a pair of cavity modes on the cy-
cling transition. This allows us to predict the viability of
the scheme with a real atom, using parameters relevant
to recent nanofiber cavity QED experiments. We finish
with some concluding remarks in Sectio:

II. SINGLE-ATOM CAVITY QED SYSTEM

When an atom is illuminated by a coherent laser field,
the scattered light contains an incoherent component
that grows increasingly prominent with laser intensity.
When the Rabi frequency Q is sufficiently large, the
power spectrum of scattered light acquires a character-
istic triplet structure, centered on the bare atomic res-
onance [3]. The Mollow triplet can be interpreted in a
basis of dressed eigenstates of the resonance fluorescence
Hamiltonian [6]. Each manifold of N total excitations is
split into a double ,; with corresponding energies that are
separated by the Rabi frequency. Three distinct tran-
sition energies are resonant between respective pairs in
each adjacent manifold; a central peak at the bare atomic
resonance, and a pair of fluorescence peaks respectively
blue- and red-shifted by +Q.

The emission from resonance fluorescence is randomly
scattered into free space, and cannot generally be cap-
tured entirely. Instead, a portion of the field is typically
channeled with a high numerical aperture lens [20] or by
Purcell enhancement with a broadband cavity [14]. Prop-
erties of the captured field can then be investigated, and
supplemented with further filtering to isolate specific fre-
quencies. We propose a novel set-up that siphons specific
frequency components of the triplet directly into fiber, by
coupling the atom simultaneously to adjacent modes of
a nanofiber cavity, as depicted in Fig. fifa). The config-
uration of cavity resonances that we consider is depicted
in Fig. fit); two adjacent cavity modes are tuned to be
resonant half an FSR above and below the bare atomic
transition frequency, respectively. If the atom is driven
with a Rabi frequency equal to half the FSR, that is
Q = Ao, the fluorescence sidebands of the Mollow triplet
will each be resonant with one of the cavity modes.

A. Characterizing the Fields

The steady-state power spectrum of a source is cal-
culated from two-time correlations in the output field,
through the Fourier transform

Plw)= ef (0100), Owed’, )

where O is an output field operator, and (01,0)... =
(O10),.—| (O),. ?, with the subscripts indicating steady-
state expectations. In particular, the atomic emission
spectrum is calculated using the operator /ya_, where
o_ is the Pauli lowering operator and y is the atomic
linewidth (FWHM). Emission spectra for each mode of
the cavity are calculated using the operators V2Kf and
V2Kb, respectively, where * and b are annihilation oper-
ators for red- and blue-detuned cavity modes, and k is
the cavity field decay rate. The spectrum of the total
cavity field (restricted to the two modes of interest) is

calculated using the operator EO = =v IKE), where

an implementation with a cesium atom, in the following

Ill. TWO-LEVEL MODEL
A. Multimode Jaynes-Cummings Model

We start with an idealized model of a two-level atom,
coupled to a pair of cavity modes. If the atom is res-
onantly driven, the Jaynes-Cummings model extends to
give the interaction picture Hamiltonian (with respect to
the atomic transition frequency)

where the atom-cavity coupling strength g is assumed to
be real and the identical for both cavity modes.

The composite density operator, p for the system
evolves according to the Lindblad master equation (h =
1),

b= —i[H, p] + yD(6-)[A] + 2eD(P)[6] + 2eDO)[A], (6)

with the dissipative superoperators D(O)[A] = OpOt —
L010/ oa 3/010. This model assumes that each cavity
mode has the same decay rate, and furthermore that each
decays independently, which is valid as long as they are
well resolved in frequency, i.e., Ao > {g, K}. To illus-
rate the operating principles of the scheme, we focus on
he specific case of Ag = 257.

Fig. 2a) shows the cavity flux as a function of Rabi
frequency, for a few values of the atom-cavity coupling
strength g. The flux is maximum when the Rabi fre-
quency is chosen appropriately for the respective cavity
FSR (ie., Q = Ao), so that the Mollow sidebands are
each resonant with a cavity mode. Choosing the driving
strengths accordingly, Fig. 2b) shows the atomic and
cavity power spectra for the corresponding cavity con-
figurations. In each case, the overall cavity emission is
doubly peaked, representing the two populated modes.
n the limit of weak coupling, the cavity essentially acts
as a pair of band-pass filters that siphon a portion o!
he atomic emission spectrum without significantly af
fecting the structure. As the coupling strength increases,
he widths and relative prominence of the atomic emis-
sion peaks are modified. The central peak is diminishec
as cavity modes enhance the fluorescent sideband transi-
ions, thereby diminishing resonant scattering. Further-
more, the peaks are broadened by cavity modes because
of the modified vacuum fluctuations in the vicinity of the

sidebands [24].

where fj,(t) and bin(t) are input quantum noise operators
that satisfy the commutation relations [#in(t), 71,(t’)] =

put fields are vacuum and therefore do not contribute to
photon correlations, one can see from the above equations
that, in this limit of weak coupling, the cavity correla-
tions are representative of the underlying, filtered atomic
dressed-state correlations (see Appendix|A|for more dis-
cussion).

C. Photon Correlations

Second-order coincidence correlations for the cavity
emission are shown in Fig. The total emitted cav-
ity field (2) is bunched for the parameters that we
consider, from simultaneous scattering in each of the
two fluorescence sidebands [10]. Nonetheless, each of the
separate cavity modes is antibunched because of the in-
herently discrete nature of the fluorescent dressed state
transitions. When the cavity bandwidth becomes too
small, the antibunching is lost due to the correlations
being dominated by interference effects of the cavities,
rather than the underlying source statistics [25] [26]. The
cross-correlation between the pair of cavity modes shows
bunching due to the correlated emission of light in the
red and blue fluorescence transitions, so long as the cav-
ity resonance is sharp enough to effectively isolate the
components. If the cavity bandwidth is too large, pho-
tons from the elastic scattering peak can also couple into
the cavity modes, which commensurately affects the na-
ture of the photon correlations.

For example, when both cavities have parameters
g = Kk = 4, the overall output field is bunched, with

“(2
92.,(0) = 15.

The auto-correlation for each cavity
mode shows antibunching, with 9 (0) = 0.36, while
the cross-correlation shows bunching between the modes
as (0) = 1.32. For all values shown in Fig. the
correlations clearly violate both the single- and two-
mode Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities Eqs. and (with
r=),

Another key aspect of the photon statistics, beyond co-

incidence, is the time dependence of correlations. Fig

shows the time-dependent photon correlations from the
cavity modes, for some sample cavity parameters. It is

evident that the emission violates the single-mode time-
dependent Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities Eqs. and
over timescales of a few atomic lifetimes. When the cav-
ity decay rate is appropriately chosen, and the coupling
weak, the cross-correlations take an initial value close
to unity. This is caused by an interference effect that
arises when filtering the Mollow spectrum side-peaks [27].
However, for higher cooperativity cavities, the coupling
allows the two modes to be initially more strongly cor-
related. This increased cross-correlation comes with the

consequence of reducing the anti-correlation within the
modes.

Iv. ALKALI ATOM MODEL

Having examined an idealized model of the system,
we now model a potential implementation of the scheme
in an alkali-atom-based, nanofiber cavity QED system.
n order to realize two-level behavior within the multi-
level cesium atom, the D2-line cycling transition (ie.,
6S1/2,F =4,mp=+4) © |6P3/2,F =5,mpr = +5))
is driven with a circularly-polarized (¢ = +1) laser.
Nanofiber cavities generally support linearly-polarized
eigenmodes, so an adjacent pair of the horizontally-
polarized modes are used to couple to the closed tran-
sition. Birefringence of the fiber shifts the vertically-
polarized modes away from the relevant frequencies, and
hey can therefore be neglected. The specific configura-
ion we consider is shown in Fig.] illustrating transitions
involving the targeted mp = —4 ground state. Cavity-
induced transitions to the mz = —3' states are sup-
ressed as long as |Ag — Apvs’| > ¥ for each of the hyper-
fine excited states, where 7/27 = 5.2 MHz. This is helped
y the favorable Clebsch-Gordan coefficients in cesium;
he ratio of coupling strength on the cycling transition
compared to the mp = —3’ states is 0.15, 0.34, and 0.44,
for the F’ = 5’, 4’ and 3’ states, respectively [28].

notation, horizontally- polarized transitions are expressed
as a sum of circular polarizations, Dj, = a(x + D_ ).
The electric dipole coupling Hamiltonian is then ex-
pressed compactly as

where introducing gy = V2g compensates for the scal-
ing factor in the horizontal dipole operator, for the sake
of comparison with the two-level-atom case. The cesium
atom master equation has three distinct terms for atomic
decay, to describe spontaneous emission for each polar-
ization, as

A] + 2xD(F) [A] + 2nD(b)[A].

(15)
That is, spontaneous emission is treated collectively with
respect to the hyperfine levels, and independently with
respect to polarization. As in the simple model, we focus
on the special case of Ag = 2 = 257.

Fig. [6] disp ays the steady-state spectra of atomic and
cavity emission from the cesium system, showing equiva-
lent features to those predicted by the simple model. In
the regimes we consider, the atom remains well confined
to the cycling transition; the most extreme parameters
still retain > 97% population confinement. Additional
repumping lasers and/or external magnetic field Zeeman
shifts can enhance the confinement if desired, but we do
not explicitly implement these methods here.

With the model configured appropriately, Fig. [7]shows
the second-order auto- and cross-correlations for the cav-
ity modes coupled to the cesium atom. The system ex-
hibits nonclassical features that are almost identical to
those predicted in the ideal two-level model. The cav-
ity modes display antibunched photon counting statis-
tics, and cross-correlations that surpass the initial auto-
correlation value, in violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz in-
equalities, Eqs. and 4. In particular, for Kk = g = 7,

the modes have an — ion of o(0) = = 0.35 and

Vv. CONCLUSION

We have proposed a method to generate nonclassical
photon statistics in the output field of a pair of cavity
modes, coupled to a single two-level atom. This builds
on previous work that examined the correlations between
different frequencies of the Mollow spectrum. By working
with a long cavity that has a relatively small FSR, two
adjacent modes can couple to the same atomic transition,
transferring the atomic correlations to the pair of cavity
modes. The spectral-filtering and cavity enhancement
that is inherent to this scheme could prove useful for the
generation of entangled photon pairs, and photonic Bell
states [I[2H14]. We also demonstrated that implement-
ing this method should be viable with a real atom-cavity
system, using a model of a single °Cs atom, and with
parameters relevant to a contemporary nanofiber cavity
QED system.

Appendix A: Atomic Dressed-State Picture

Bare-state atomic raising (6, = |e) (g|) and lowering (@_ =
dressed basis states,

Ig) (e

) operators are first expressed in terms of the

+) = + (el). Al
|+) a (Ig) + (el) (Al)

Introducing dressed-state spin operators
a =l+)41-I-)(-l, @2=|-)Gl, eR =H) Cl, (A2)
the Pauli raising and lowering operators can be expressed as

aP x= (62 - 3”). (A3)
Using these expressions, the Hamiltonian (5) becomes
Q -\ [1 1 1 1 *

Moving into a new interaction picture defined by the transformation Hamiltonian

the operators pick up the following explicit time dependencies

A secular approximation neglects terms that oscillate like e*’4°¢ or e+#(@+40)*, on the grounds that Q, Ap >> g. With
the resonance condition Q = Ag, one arrives at

Fy = $[ (rb!) a +6? P(e -)]. (A7)

With this effective Hamiltonian, and taking into account cavity field-mode decay at rate Kk, we can write down
Heisenberg-Langevin equations for the cavity field operators in the forms

f= x19 4D — KP + V2KFin(t),

where Fin(t) and bis ,(t) are input-field quantum noise operators satisfying the standard commutation relations
[Pies alt y= [bin a(t), att) = 6(t — t') 29}. We also assume that fi,(t) and bin (t) are independent, i.e.,
[Fin (€), bin (t") Ve Tel), oh (t! )] = 0. Steady-state solutions for the operators are found by formally integrating the
above equations:

Assuming vacuum field inputs to the two cavity modes, it follows that the red- and blue-detuned cavity modes exhibit
photon statistics that are representative of the underlying filtered dressed state transitions. In particular, from [1][27],
the auto-correlations are of the approximate forms

g(r) ~1—e727 g( (r) #1 —e7?7, (All)

while the cross-correlations are expressed as

1 1
g(r )rwe 27-14 = 5 (2- enn)? 7 xo (A12)

These expressions predict an initial autocorrelation value of 9 (0) ~0 (9 (0) ~ 0), and an initial cross-correlation

9° (0) ~ 1, and show reasonably good agreement with the results shown in Figs. ld and [7 for the largest value of k
considered and with the smaller values of g.
