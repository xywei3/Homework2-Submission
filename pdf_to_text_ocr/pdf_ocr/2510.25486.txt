The LHC generates an intense beam of high-energy neutrinos in the forward direction, whose
scientific potential has been left unexploited for many years. The FASER and SND@LHC exper-
iments, operating since 2023, have recently measured LHC neutrinos for the first time. In this
contribution we discuss how to produce accurate predictions, including NLO QCD corrections and
modern parton shower algorithms, for present and future LHC neutrino experiments, including
those at the proposed Forward Physics Facility (FPF). To this end, the energy and rapidity distri-
bution of the LHC neutrinos is encoded in a LHAPDF grid interfaced to the neutrino DIS event
generator in the POWHEG-BOX-RES framework. This Monte Carlo tool enables the modelling of
differential distributions that are sensitive to hadronic final states, initial- and final-state radiation,
and realistic acceptance and selection cuts. As a first application, we deploy this event generator to
compute fast-interpolation grids and carry out a first determination of the LHC forward neutrino
fluxes directly from FASER data using the NNPDF fitting methodology.

NLO event generation for LHC neutrinos Peter Krack

1. Introduction

Even though the LHC produces high-energy neutrinos of all three flavours, these neutrinos
have for a long time been ignored, and escaped undetected in the far-forward region. The first
experiments to explore the LHC far-forward region and to observe the neutrinos are FASER [1] and
SND@LHC [2]. In particular, the FASER [3] experiment has measured the neutrino interaction
cross-section at TeV energies, the highest energy neutrinos produced at laboratory experiments so
far.

Understanding these experiments require an accurate modelling of the neutrino-hadron inter-
action: the deep-inelastic scattering process [4]. Calculations up to third order in perturbative
QCD are available for the inclusive cross-section and the double-differential distributions in x and
Q? [5]. In order to study exclusive quantities with generic final-state cuts, a Monte Carlo event
generator matched to a parton shower is required. Most neutrino scattering experiments, including
those from the LHC, have been relying on the leading-order event generator GENIE [6], which uses
phenomenological Bodek-Yang model [7] and the Pyru1a6 parton shower and hadronisation algo-
rithm [8]. For inclusive quantities, GENIE can be made NLO-aware using the HEDIS module [9],
but does not allow for the incorporation of acceptance cuts or the matching to a PS generator. At
next-to leading order, Monte Carlo event generators using the POWHEG method recently became
available [10-13], which can be interfaced to the Pyria8 general-purpose Monte Carlo event
generator [14]. In addition to the modelling of collider neutrino scattering, POWHEG is also able
to simulate neutral-current DIS with LHC muons, whose event rates are actually much higher than
those of neutrino-initiated reactions [15].

Assuming that the neutrino-hadron interactions at TeV energies can be modelled within pertur-
bative QCD [16], the neutrino flux can be extracted in a theory-agnostic, data-driven approach using
machine learning (ML) methods. In this case, the extraction of the neutrino flux is formally equiv-
alent to the extraction of the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton. The determination
of the neutrino flux provides constraints on light- and heavy-meson production at the LHC.

In this contribution, a phenomenological analysis of DIS at NLO is presented that was published
in [12] and recent progress on the extraction of the neutrino flux from measurements at far-forward
experiments is that has since been published in [17] are briefly summarised.

with FASER acceptance cuts and a fixed neutrino energy of E,, = 1 GeV The HEDIS tune in
GENIE was used, with the HERAPDF1.5 NLO PDF set [18]. Differences between the two tools
are expected, since the hard scattering matrix element, PDFs parton shower, and other input setting
differ. Depending on the observable, differences up to 20% can be observed.

Figure 1: POWHEG+Pyrtui1a8 at LO and NLO compared to GENIE. The distribution for the scattering
angle of the final state lepton shows the most drastic disagreement, while the energy of the hadronic state
agrees between the two Monte Carlo tools.

2.3 Modelling of high-energy neutrino DIS

The impact of NLO QCD corrections, the variation of parton shower algorithm and tune can
be studied. The following predictions are for the FASERy detector, assuming cuts on the energy
of the final state lepton Ez > 100 GeV, the energy of the hadronic system E;, > 100 GeV and the
scattering angle of the final state lepton tan@ < 0.025. The predictions are computed using the
NNPDF4.0 NNLO PDF set and assuming isospin symmetry to model the nuclear target.

2.3.1 Impact of NLO QCD corrections

In figure 2 the differential distribution for the energy of the hadronic system can be found,
computed at LO and NLO. The uncertainties are determined from seven-point scale variation. The
NLO corrections can have an impact of a few percent up to 10% in this case.

2.3.2. Impact of the parton shower algorithm

The choice of parton shower algorithm affects exclusive quantities that depend on the hadronic
final state. Inclusive quantities like Ez, 0¢, Q? or E;, are largely insensitive to the choice of parton
shower. Figure 3 shows the distribution for the energy of the leading pion, comparing the result

difference becomes smaller when showering NLO events, since the hardest emission is already
included in the matrix element.

2.3.3, Impact of soft QCD

Parameters that control soft and non-perturbative QCD in PyTu1a8 are set by the tune adopted
by the shower algorithm. The effects that are modelled by the tune can further include hadronisation,
multi-parton interactions and underlying event. In figure 4 the default Monash 2013 tune is compared
to the tune from [19] for forward physics to data from the LHCf experiment [20-23] for the energy

of the leading neutron. Especially parameters controlling the beam remnant hadronisation have be
tuned. Even though the LHCf tune is not dedicated to neutrino DIS, it can provide an estimate of
how the predictions are affected. Overall, a difference of around 10% is found for the distribution
of E,,. Similar results have been obtained for other exclusive quantities, such as E,, and Ex, while
inclusive quantities remained mostly unaffected by variations of the tune.

3. Extraction of the forward neutrino flux

The problem of extracting the neutrino flux is equivalent to extracting a PDF. Therefore, an
approach following the NNPDF methodology [24—26] can be taken. For the implementation of the
FASER data, the neutrino DIS event generator can be used to compute the necessary fast-interface
(FK-tables) [27, 28].

3.1 Methodology

The neutrino flux is parametrised using a small neural network and a preprocessing function.
fui (Xv) = x (1 — x)? NN(xy) (1)

The preprocessing function guarantees the behaviour at low- and high-x,. The fit of the neutrino
flux is performed via a y? minimisation. Uncertainties on the neutrino flux can be determined using
the Monte Carlo replica method.

3.2. Results

In figure 5 a fit of the neutrino flux for the six datapoints measured by the FASERv experiment
[3] can be found, with the 68% CL uncertainties. The uncertainties coincide with the experimental
uncertainties in the region with data, but grow large in the unconstrained high-x, region. Next to

fit shows that, already with this small dataset, there are regions in which the flux generated with
DPMIJET can be disfavoured at a 4a level. The overall best agreement is found for the case in which
the light hadron production was modelled usign EPOS or QGSJET and the charmed hadrons with
POWHEG.

4. Summary

The comparison between the GENIE and the POWHEG-BOX implementation of neutrino DIS
has shown that there are sizeable differences and that higher-order effects cannot be neglected. The
impact of the NLO correction, variants of parton showers and tunes for hadronisation lead to non
negligible effects. The method to extract the flux has proven, that with just a few datapoint, this

method exhibits a sensitivity for forward hadron production and can discriminate between different

event generators.
