Abstract A wide range of scintillating bolometers is
under investigation for applications in the search for
rare events and processes beyond the Standard Model.
In this work, we report the first measurement of a natu-
ral, non-molybdenum-doped, lithium tungstate (Lig WO.)
as a scintillating cryo-
achieved a baseline en-

crystal operated underground
genic calorimeter. The detector
ergy resolution of 0.5 keV RMS with a low-energy thresh-
old of about 1.5 keV. The simul
and light enabled particle identification, revealing a clear
separation between 8/7, a, and nuclear recoil popula-
tions above 300 keV, with a light-yield—based particle
discrimination better than 60. These results, fully com-
parable with those achieved with other compounds in
the field, demonstrate that LigWOz, is a promising can-
didate for rare-event searches. In particular, the combi-
nation of excellent radio-purity (with U/Th levels be-
low 0.5 mBq/kg) and sensitivity to neutron interac-
tions via the °Li(n,a)H reaction makes this material
an attractive option for next-generation experiments on

aneous readout of heat

dark matter, coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scatter-
ing, and spin-dependent interactions.

1 Introduction

Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CEvNS)
process represents a unique probe at the intersection of
particle, nuclear, and astroparticle physics. Predicted
within the Standard Model (SM) [1, 2] 50 years ago,
CEVNS involves the scattering of low-energy neutri-
nos off entire nuclei via neutral-current interactions,
resulting in a detectable nuclear recoil with energies
ranging from a few eV up to several keV, depending
on the target mass. Despite its early theoretical pre-
diction, the process was experimentally observed only
in 2017 by the COHERENT collaboration [3], due to
the need for ultra-low threshold detectors and the lack
of suitable technology until recent advancements [4].
The relatively large interaction cross-section of CEvNS,
along with its equal sensitivity to all neutrino flavors
via the Z° boson exchange, makes it an ideal detect-

ing mechanism for neutrinos from various sources, such
as the Sun, supernovae, nuclear reactors, and radioac-
tive decays. Its sensitivity to subtle deviations from SM
predictions enables the exploration of exotic neutrino
properties, non-standard interactions, sterile neutrinos,

neutrino magnetic moments, and potential light media-
tors like new gauge bosons [5-8]. Furthermore, CEvNS
plays a critical role in characterizing neutrino-induced
backgrounds for next-generation dark matter experi-
ments, which share the need for low-threshold and high-
precision detection.
The CEVNS differential cross-section of a neutrino
with a spin-zero nucleus NV according to the SM prin-
ciples [1, 2] is

where Gr is the Fermi coupling constant, Ow is the
Weinberg angle, Z and N are the atomic and neutron
numbers of the target nucleus, my is its mass, and E,,
is the incoming neutrino energy. The functions FX (@)
and FY@ are, respectively, the neutron and proton
form factors of the nucleus NV’, which characterize the
coherency of the interaction and depend on the neutron
and proton distributions in the nucleus.

A strong correlation exists between the incoming
neutrino energy (£,,) and the recoil energy, as shown
by the average recoil [9]:

indicating that higher-energy neutrinos significantly en-
hance the recoil signal.

As shown in Fig. 1, CEvNS cross-sections can be up
to 103-104 times larger than other conventional neu-
trino detection channels. Scaling with N? under coher-
ent conditions, heavy nuclei are ideal candidates due
to their high neutron number and nuclear stability, en-
abling both high interaction rates and low backgrounds.
Additionally, the cross-section is proportional to the
square of the neutrino energy, E?, further favoring higher
energy sources. For heavy elements (Xe, W, Pb), the
cross-section is higher, but the required threshold is
lower. Conversely, for light elements (Li, O), the cross-
section is lower, but the recoils reach higher energies.
Indeed, having a recoil at higher energy can ease the
experimental constraint on having an extremely low
hreshold detector.

The renewed interest in CEvNS as a SM probe and
neutrino detection channel [13-16] pushes the scientific
community to develop detection techniques to probe
low-energy nuclear recoils produced by artificial neu-
rino sources. The COHERENT experiment achieved
the first detection of coherent elastic neutrino—nucleus
scattering at a 6.7 o significance using a 14.6 kg CsI[Na]
detector at the Spallation Neutron Source (Oak Ridge
National Laboratory, USA), confirming Standard Model
predictions and setting new limits on possible nonstan-
dard neutrino interactions [3]. Recently the CONUS+
experiment, based on high-purity germanium detectors

tom. CEvNS differential cross sections as a function of the nu-
clear recoil energy. Following the work in Ref. [10], a monochro-
matic neutrino of 747 keV emitted in the 5! Cr decay is assumed,
while considering a reactor neutrino with an energy of 3-4 MeV,
the spectra shift toward higher energies by a factor of ~20 (see
Eq. 2). Lighter elements, such as lithium (Li) and oxygen (O),
have a higher energy recoil, thereby relaxing the energy threshold
requirements. Figures adapted from Refs. [11, 12].

scattering from reactor neutrinos with a statistical sig-
nificance of 3.70 [17]. NUCLEUS [18] employs cryo-
genic bolometers made of CaWOy, and Al2O3 to detect
CEVNS from continuous flux of reactor neutrinos with
thresholds of a few tens of eV. Finally, RICOCHET [19]
uses cryogenic detectors with Ge and Zn targets to mea-
sure CEvNS from reactor neutrinos, aiming for high
precision and sensitivity to new physics. Since these de-
tectors typically operate near nuclear reactors at shal-
low depths, they must meet a combination of stringent
requirements:

— compact detector size, to handle the high event rates
at surface locations;

— high radio-purity, to suppress background from ra-
dioactive decays and minimize false nuclear recoil
signals;

with extremely low-energy threshold (160 eV), has achieved — energy threshold in the eV range, enabling sensitiv-

the first observation of coherent elastic neutrino—nucleus

ity to the recoil energies expected from CEvNS;
— particle identification capability, to discriminate nu-
clear recoils from electron recoils and other back-
grounds;

— in-situ neutron monitoring capability, to provide valu-
able information for background characterization and
its rejection.

From a detection technology perspective, cryogenic
calorimeters represent a promising solution to meet all
these requirements. Operating at milliKelvin tempera-
tures, these detectors can accurately measure extremely
small energy deposits [20-22]. In particular, they achieve
energy thresholds at the eV scale, offer excellent energy
resolution (as low as 0.1%), and provide efficient par-
ticle discrimination between nuclear and electron re-
coils, particularly through light readout in scintillat-
ing crystals. All these features make them well-suited
for detecting the faint signals characteristic of CEvNS.
Moreover, the versatility in the choice of absorber ma-
terial in cryogenic calorimeters allows one to choose the
most suitable one for the specific physics case. A lithium
tungstate (Lig WO.) crystal emerges as a promising can-
didate among potential target materials for CEvNS de-
tection. Its heavy tungsten content enhances the inter-
action rate of CEVNS (see Fig. 1), while its lithium com-
ponent —with approximately 8% natural abundance of
®Li— enables efficient neutron background suppression
via neutron capture reactions. Additionally, LigWO4
exhibits scintillation properties [23] that enable simul-
taneous phonon and light detection, which is crucial
for distinguishing between a particles, nuclear and elec-
tronic recoils at low energies. The interest in this ma-
terial has grown significantly in recent years, also driven
by the establishment of the lithium molybdate (LizgMoO.)
as a target material for CUPID [24] and AMORE [25] in
the search for neutrinoless double beta decay of !°°Mo.
For instance, in Ref. [23], the scintillation properties of
natural LigWO4, and LigMoO, crystals were compared
in a wide temperature range.

The first cryogenic characterization of an 8-gram
Li,WO, crystal doped with 5% molybdenum was per-
formed in the framework of the BASKET project: [26].
Here the authors demonstrated an excellent baseline
noise of 1.1 keV FWHM, an energy resolution of 3.7 keV
FWHM at 609 keV, and a clear particle discrimination
capability at a level of 50 between a and 3/7 events
when assisted by the Neganov—Trofimov—Luke amplifi-
cation for light detection. These results, together with
a low level of internal radioactive contamination, con-
firm the promising potential of LigWO.(Mo) for rare
event searches and CEVNS experiments in aboveground
conditions. A further measurement of the same crystal
sample was then carried out using a Metallic Magnetic
Calorimeter (MMC) as a thermal sensor [27], achiev-

ing an excellent baseline energy resolution of 194.1 eV
FWHM (o = 83 eV).

This work presents the first measurement of a large-
mass non-molybdenum-doped Liz WO, crystal operated
underground as a cryogenic scintillating calorimeter to
enable light-assisted particle discrimination. The calori-
metric detector performance and scintillation light yield
of the crystal were investigated to evaluate its potential
for rare event detection. These results lay the ground-
work for the future use of LigWO,-based detectors in
next-generation dark matter and neutrino physics ex-
periments.

2 Crystal production

The Liz WO, single crystal used in this study was grown
by a Low-Thermal-Gradient modification (LTG) of the
Czochralski technique developed at the Institute of In-
organic Chemistry SB RAS for production of large-
volume high-quality oxide crystals [28-31], and that
later was adopted to produce unique crystals for funda-
mental studies, including isotopically enriched crystals
106 CqWOg, SCdWOg, Zn!°MoO,g and Liz!°°MoO, [32-
35].

The initial charge (Liz WO, compound) was obtained
through a solid-state synthesis from the commercial
lithium carbonate (LigCO3) and deeply purified tung-
sten oxide powder (WO3) [35] following the reaction:
LiyCO3 + WO3 > LiyWO4 + CO2 t (3)

The thoroughly mixed precursors were placed in a plat-
inum crucible, heated to 450°C at a rate of 25°C/h un-
der an air atmosphere, annealed for 10 hours, and then
cooled to room temperature at a rate of 100°C/h. For
the subsequent crystal growth, the crucible with the
charge was heated to 770°C at a rate of 100°C/h, held
for 4 hours to homogenize the melt, and then cooled
slightly to 735°C for the seeding process. The optimal
seed orientation was defined as [001]. The growth pa-
rameters (pulling rate of 1 mm/h and rotation rate of
5 rpm) allowed the realization of a standard growth
mechanism with a rounded, slightly convex crystalliza-
tion front, and to obtain the LigWO, single crystalline
ingot without visible defects or inclusions with dimen-
sions 70 mm in length and 30 mm in diameter. Then,
a crystal sample with dimensions @24.3 25.3 mm was
procured, as shown in Fig. 2. One face of the cylindrical
sample was optically polished, while the other face and
the lateral surface were matted.

3 Experimental setup

The measurements with the dual-readout Lig WO, scin-
tillating calorimeter were performed in the IETI facil-
ity, a pulse tube-assisted dilution refrigerator located in
Hall C of the underground Gran Sasso National Lab-
oratory of INFN (Assergi, Italy). The LigWO, crystal
was equipped with a germanium neutron transmuta-
tion doped thermistor (Ge-NTD) [36], with dimensions
of 3 x 3 x 1 mm‘, glued on the upper surface with six
spots of bi-component epoxy resin (Araldite Rapid). A
copper holder secures the target crystal, held in place
by polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) supports. To detect:
the scintillation light, a germanium light detector (Ge-
LD) is installed facing the upper polished surface of the
LigWO, crystal. The Ge-LD consists of a double-sided
polished wafer (@44.5 mm, thickness 170 4m) with one
side coated with an anti-reflective coating (facing the
LigWO,) made of SiO to increase the light absorp-
tion efficiency. On the opposite surface of the Ge/LD, a
3x 1x 1mm? Ge-NTD was glued in the same manner.
An extensive description of the Ge-LD development and
performance is reported in Refs. [37, 38]. The surfaces of
the LigWO, crystal, except the one facing the Ge-LD,
were wrapped with a 3M VIKUITI reflective foil. The
Ge-NTDs are connected to the bias and readout system
via 25 ym gold wires, which are grafted onto twisted
pairs of constantan wires and then attached to a ther-
mally anchored board located on the mixing chamber

plate of the cryostat. Through the wiring resident in the
cryostat, the signal reaches room-temperature electron-
ics, which include low-noise front-end boards and DC
coupling, along with high-resolution digitizers [39, 40].

During data collection, the Ge-LD continuously faces
a Fe X-ray source directly installed within the detec-
tor holder for energy calibration. To set the energy scale
of the Lig WO, detector, an external y source of ?3?Th
was employed, positioned between the 300 K shield of
the cryostat and the external lead and copper shield-
ing. In two specific runs, to study the response of the
Li. WO, detector to a particles and nuclear recoils, the
?32Th source was replaced by an Americium-Beryllium
(AmBe) neutron source. The continuous data stream
was registered with a sampling rate of 10 kHz for the
232Th and 5 kHz for the AmBe data, applying a low-
pass Bessel filter with a cutoff frequency of 500 Hz to
reduce higher-frequency noise [40]. Data were collected
for approximately 98 hours in this configuration, fol-
lowed by an additional 28 hours (14 with a water mod-
erator and 14 without it) measurement using an AmBe
neutron source. Data were stored as binary files for of-
fline processing and analysis.

4 Data Analysis

The collected data were analyzed using a custom soft-
ware framework designed to trigger and process signals
from cryogenic calorimeters. An event was flagged as a
signal if its amplitude exceeded a threshold of 30 above
the baseline noise. When a trigger fires on the LigWO,,
the corresponding light signal is automatically triggered
on the Ge-LD even if below threshold. In addition, noise
events are randomly selected every 5 seconds for char-
acterization purposes. A multi-step analysis procedure
was employed to reconstruct the amplitude of triggered
events. First, the baseline level, slope of the pre-trigger,
root mean square (RMS) noise, rise time, decay time,
and unfiltered amplitude within a predefined analy-
sis window were computed. Then, the signal and noise
waveforms were selected to construct the optimal filter
transfer function [41], considering only events with a
single trigger per acquisition window and a stable pre-
trigger baseline. For the LigWO, detector, the signal
template is derived from events at 2.6 MeV to ensure
a high signal-to-noise ratio. After applying the opti-
mum filter, thermal gain stabilization was performed to
correct for possible amplitude drifts, using events from
20ST] at 2.6 MeV. The same analysis procedures were
applied to the Ge-LD, using events from the °°Fe peak
at 5.9 keV to perform both stabilization and calibration.
The energy scale of the heat channel was calibrated

ness, the resolutions of the baseline and of the 59.5 keV line due

ure 3 shows the resulting calibration spectrum of ?3?Th
collected over 98 hours with the LigWOy, crystal (top
panel) and the Ge-LD energy spectrum calibrated with
55Fe (bottom panel). These spectra were obtained by
removing spurious events based on the following crite-
ria:

— events with multiple triggers within the analysis win-
dow were rejected;

— only waveforms with a baseline slope within +20 of
the distribution were retained;
— rise and decay times were required to fall within

+30 of their mean values.

More details on the data processing are reported in

Refs. [42, 43].

5 Results

5.1 Energy Threshold and Energy Resolution

Following the above-described analysis procedure, a 0.50+

0.01 keV RMS baseline noise was achieved, referring to
1.5 keV trigger threshold for the LigWO, detector, de-
fined as 30 of the baseline noise. The energy resolution
of the Lig WO, detector was evaluated using the calibra-
tion y-ray peaks, as summarized in Table 1. For the LD,
the baseline resolution of 27.2 + 0.1 eV RMS was mea-
sured, along with the energy resolution of ¢ = 77+1 eV
at 5.9 keV. A global summary of the main performance
is reported in Table 2.

Although still far from the requirements for CEvNS
detection, these results demonstrate the feasibility of

using the molybdenum-free LigWO, crystal as a cryo-
genic calorimeter for radiation detection.

Fig. 3 Energy spectra acquired over 98 hours with the LigWO.4
crystal (top) and the Ge-LD (bottom) using an external ?9?Th
calibration source. In the LigWOs4 spectrum, all peaks exploited
for the energy calibration are highlighted and labeled following
the list in Tab. 1. Due to its small thickness (170 jum), the light
detector cannot fully absorb the ?3?Th y-rays, resulting in a fea-
tureless continuum spectrum. Superimposed on this latter are the
scintillation light signals from the LigWO, crystal (0-2 keV), as
well as X-rays from the >>Fe calibration source (5.9 and 6.4 keV),
and characteristic calcium X-rays (3.7 and 4.0 keV).

5.2 Particle identification in LigWO.

To investigate the particle discrimination capability of
the LigWO, detector at low-energy, a neutron calibra-
tion was performed using an AmBe source. The latter
produces fast neutrons through the nuclear reaction

a+ Be > ’Ct+n (4)

with neutron energies ranging approximately from 1 to
10 MeV. Since fast neutrons interact primarily via elas-
tic scattering, they induce nuclear recoils of lithium,
tungsten, and oxygen within the LigWOy, crystal. In
addition to neutrons, the source emits high-energy y-
rays, predominantly at 4.4 MeV, resulting from the de-
excitation of !?C nuclei. The AmBe source was placed
outside the cryostat in two different configurations: with
and without a water moderator. Data was taken over

14 hours in each configuration.

Fig. 4 presents the resulting scatter plot of the scin-
tillation light yield versus energy. It features a promi-
nent a peak at 5190 keV, corresponding to neutron cap-
ture events on Li. Notably, the nominal energy of this

process is 4784 keV, and an 8% shift due to thermal
quenching is observed, consistent with previous mea-
surements in similar crystals [44, 45]. The energy reso-
ution of this peak is evaluated to be o = 3.5+0.5 keV.

The scintillation light yield (LY), defined as the ra-
io of the light signal to the heat signal produced at a
certain energy deposition, was used as a key parame-
er for particle identification. Expressed in keV /MeV,

he detected LY is influenced by several experimental
actors, including scintillation efficiency of the crystal

at low temperatures, its optical properties (i.e. optical
transmittance), crystal geometry and its surface treat-
ment, light collection efficiency of the setup, and the Ge-
LD light detection efficiency. For these reasons, what is
quoted in the following is not the absolute LY of the
LigWO, but the LY measured in this specific detector
configuration.

As shown in Fig. 4, four distinct event populations
are observed:

— 6/y band, with a LY of 0.59 + 0.06 keV /MeV eval-
uated in the range 0.3 — 3 MeV on ?°?Th data;

— a particles, with a LY of 0.13+0.01 keV /MeV eval-
uated at 2—6 MeV on 7°?Th data;

— a particles + 9H, due to neutron capture on °Li,
with a LY of 0.13 + 0.01 keV/MeV evaluated at 5 —
6 MeV on AmBe data;

— nuclear recoils, with a LY of 0.08 + 0.04 keV/MeV
evaluated in the range 0.3 — 3 MeV on AmBe data.

The reported values were obtained by performing
a Gaussian fit to the LY distribution of each popula-
tion within the specified energy range. To adopt a con-
servative approach, the standard deviation (c) of the
distribution is quoted as uncertainty. For the LY of nu-
clear recoils, the uncertainty is larger than that of other
event types, as it accounts for the combined contribu-
tion of recoils on Li, O, and W nuclei. Finally, defining
the discrimination power (DP) as,

MB/y —~ Ba
4/Fa/y + 9%

where yu and o refer to the LY distribution for the differ-
ent event types, the particle identification capabilities
of the LigWO, dual-readout detector can be quanti-
fied. Using the data collected in this work, the discrim-
ination between nuclear recoils (NR) and 8/7 parti-
cles is DP = 6.8, while between a and {3/7 particles is
DP = 7.6. It is worth noting that these values represent

DP = (5)

an average within considered energy ranges, which vary
for different event populations. This reflects the need to
optimize energy ranges and to increase statistics. Fur-
ther measurements will be performed to investigate par-

ticle identification as a function of energy, improving
the energy threshold and the light collection efficiency
to assess particle discrimination at lower energies.

5.3 Radio- and chemical purity of the LigWO, crystal

One of the most effective methods to assess the inter-
nal contamination of cryogenic calorimeters caused by
radionuclides from uranium and thorium decay chains
relies on analyzing the a region of the energy spectrum.
By exploiting the extremely low counting rate in the 4—
9 MeV energy range of the LizWO, spectrum (7°?Th
calibration data), upper limits on the presence of nat-
ural radioactive isotopes can be set. It is assumed that
the latter are homogeneously distributed within the
crystal bulk, since the only evidence of surface contami-
nation concerns 7!°Po due to radon exposure, for which
counts are observed at EL, = 5300 keV caused by the es-
caping nuclear recoil (107 keV). The regions of interest
(ROIs) are defined around the Q-value of each isotope
as reported in Fig. 5. The width of each ROI is set to
+ 20 keV, corresponding to approximately 5.70. Figure

5 shows the energy spectrum in the a region, along
with the highlighted ROIs corresponding to the iso-
topes under investigation. Upper limits on the contam-
ination level are estimated under the zero-background
assumption, following the Feldman-Cousins unified ap-
proach [46]. The most prominent contribution to the
background spectrum originates from 7!°Po (Q = 5407

~ 0.1 keV/MeV, as well as the neutron-induced nuclear recoils

Additionally, a broader secondary peak is observed at
5304 keV, attributed to a decays of 7!°Po occurring on
the crystal surface. In this case, the nuclear recoils can
escape without releasing energy into the detector. For
all other elements, limits were set as shown in Tab. 3.

The chemical purity of the LigWO, crystal sample
was investigated using a quadrupole Inductively Cou-
pled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer equipped with a col-
lision cell (Agilent model 7850). A semi-quantitative
analysis was performed, by calibrating the instrument
with a single standard solution containing elements at
a known concentration level (10 ppb of Li, Co, Y, Ce,
and Tl). The contamination levels of K, Th and U were
measured using a High Resolution Inductively Coupled
Plasma Mass Spectrometer (HR-ICP-MS, Thermo Fisher
Scientific ELEMENT2) to enhance sensitivity. For K
"cool plasma" mode was adopted to reduce the back-

ground due to Ar based polyatomic interferences (8 Ar'H*).

In both cases, an uncertainty of approximately 25% was
estimated for the determined impurity concentration,
while the given concentration values are expressed in
parts per billion (ppb). A 21 mg LigWOs crystal sample
in a form of fine powder was placed in a plastic vial with
1 ml of ultrapure water. This mixture was then placed
in an ultrasonic bath at 60°C until complete sample dis-
solution. The resulting solution was further diluted with
ultrapure water to a total volume of 10 ml and acidi-
fied with 1% HNOs (a dilution factor of approximately
1500) in preparation for ICP-MS analysis. The results
of the ICP-MS measurements, listed in Tab. 4, demon-
strate the high chemical purity of the LigWOu, crystal
sample, confirming the effectiveness of the purification
process employed for the initial WO3 powder, as well
as the correctness of material handling procedures. For
instance, the purification is highly effective in removing
Th and U, with established upper limits below 0.4 and
0.3 ppb, respectively. Moreover, the LizgWO, crystal is
also pure with respect to certain low-energy a-emitting
elements, such as Sm and Pt, that guarantee a low
background counting rate in the nuclear recoil region.
Nevertheless, the crystal contains an evident amount
of Rb (135 ppb) and Cs (450 ppb), which have similar
chemical properties to Li, being all related to the al-
kali metals, and most probably came from the LizCO3
powder during the LigWO, compound synthesis. Both
these elements could be dangerous in case of rare de-
cay searches, especially at low energies, since rubidium
contains a natural ®7Rb isotope (ia. = 27.8%, Qg =
282 keV, Ty/2 = 4.97 x 10!° years) that decay through
6-decay with a yield of 100%. While cesium could be
contaminated by an artificial 8’Cs isotope, which is
impossible to separate from natural cesium, and that
can spoil the 8/y background region up to 662 keV.
However, the most intriguing chemical contamination
is molybdenum. As shown in Table 4, its concentra-
tion (8000 ppb) is the highest among all other elements.
This can be explained by the similar chemical proper-
ties of Mo and W. A dedicated ICP-MS measurement
was performed to determine the isotopic abundance of
Mo, which is present in the LigWOy, crystal; the results
are listed in Tab. 5. It is evident from the data that
molybdenum does not have a natural isotopic abun-
dance, but rather a distorted one, with the largest ex-
cess in the 1°°Mo isotope. This can be explained by the
“esrowth history” of the used platinum crucible. The lat-
ter was used earlier to produce a series of enriched and
natural LigMoO, crystals in the framework of R&D ac-
tivities for the CUPID experiment [44, 47, 48]. During
these R&Ds, molybdenum of a mixed isotopic abun-
dance was embedded in the platinum crucible walls.
Then, during the growth of the Liz WO, crystal, it was
emanated at the melting temperature from the walls
and incorporated into the crystal bulk material. Simi-
lar effect was earlier observed during production of the
archPhMoO4 crystal, as reported in Refs. [49, 50]. This
is further evidence that for the production of a low-
background crystal for studying rare nuclear processes,
only newly produced crucibles from refined materials
should be used.

6 Conclusions and perspectives

This work presents the first successful operation of a
large-mass molybdenum-free Lig WO, crystal as a dual-
readout cryogenic calorimeter. This detector, grown us-
ing the LTG Czochralski technique, which enables the
production of high-quality crystals on a kilogram scale,
represents a significant technological achievement in low-
background searches. It is the first LigWO, crystal to
enable particle identification at milliKkelvin tempera-
tures in the keV energy range. A baseline energy resolu-
tion of 0.50+0.01 keV RMS and a low-energy threshold
of 1.5 keV were demonstrated, which, although not yet

suitable for CEvNS detection, approaches the perfor-
mance observed in similar cryogenic calorimeters.

On the particle identification side, the obtained re-
sults demonstrate that LigWO, although still not meet-
ing the energy thresholds required for CEvNS detec-
tion, exhibits a particle discrimination capability (>
60) at energies higher than 300 keV comparable to
the best-performing detectors in rare-event physi
better than previous Lig WO, measurements. This con-
firms the potential of such scintillating material as a
promising candidate for low-background searches.

, and

The excellent radiopurity of the LigWO, crystal was
also confirmed, only limits below 0.5 mBq/kg were set
on the a-active nuclides from Th/U natural decay chains,
as demonstrated by the absence of visible a peaks in the
high-energy region. The only observed a contamina-
tion with the activity of 0.7+0.3 mBq/kg was ascribed
to 74°Pb/?!9Po and, most probably, caused by a sur-
face contamination of the crystal during its machining
and handling. From the other side, the crystal contains
an evident amount of Rb (135 ppb) and Cs (450 ppb),

which could be dangerous in case of rare decay searches
in energies ranging up to 662 keV. Rubidium contains a
natural §’Rb isotope (i.a. = 27.8%, Qg = 282 keV, Tiy2
= 4.97 x 10!° years) that decay through @ decay with a
yield of 100%. In comparison, cesium could be contami-
nated by an artificial '°7Cs isotope, which is impossible
to separate from the natural cesium isotope. Therefore,
extra measures should be taken to ensure the deep pu-
rification of raw materials (especially LigCO3 powder)
against these two elements. As well as to avoid possi-
ble cross-contamination during the crystal growth pro-
cess, LigWO, crystals for low-background applications
should be produced only in new platinum crucibles from
refined materials.

The following steps include coupling this crystal toa
Transition Edge Sensor (TES) and operating the setup
in a low-background cryostat to characterize the low-
energy spectrum and assess the presence of any excess
background. The relatively large mass crystal (24 g)
could be segmented or combined with optimized TES
geometries to achieve eV-scale thresholds. Finally, the
LigWOsy crystal used in this measurement could serve as
an excellent monitoring tool to assess the environmental
neutron background in underground cryogenic facilities.

In conclusion, the achieved performance clearly in-
dicates that molybdenum-free LizWO. is a favorable
material for low-background and rare-event searches.
Its excellent radio-purity, dual-readout capabilities, and
neutron sensitivity via °Li(n,a)?H make it a versatile
candidate for several interesting applications. A detailed
background measurement campaign in a source-free con-
figuration is planned to explore its potential further.
