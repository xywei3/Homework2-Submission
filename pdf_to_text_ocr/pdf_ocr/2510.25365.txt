Abstract

To elucidate low-frequency vibrational modes that modulate intramolecular charge
transfer (ICT), we investigate a benzoxazolium-coumarin (BCO™) donor-7~acceptor
derivative using transmission terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). The re-
trieved complex refractive index reveals distinct modes at 0.62, 0.85, 1.30, 1.81, and
2.07 THz. Gas-phase density functional theory (DFT) agrees well with these features
and enables assignment of specific intramolecular motions. Together, THz-TDS and
DFT identify the characteristic low-frequency modes of BCOT and suggest their con-
nection to ICT-relevant nuclear motions, demonstrating that THz-TDS provides a

sensitive probe of vibrational signatures in donor-acceptor systems.

Introduction

Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) directly captures the subpicosecond electric-
field pulse, enabling retrieval of both spectral amplitude and phase without relying on
Kramers—Kronig analysis.! Low-frequency vibrational modes (below 3 THz) serve as sen-
sitive probes of molecular flexibility and weak noncovalent interactions, and can modulate
charge-transfer pathways in organic molecules. * These collective motions encode conforma-
tional dynamics and intermolecular coupling in donor-7—acceptor (D-7—A) systems; accord-
ingly, THz-TDS accesses them directly and has been used to read out weak interactions,®
discriminate polymorphs, !° reveal transport-limiting phonons,’ and resolve H-bond network
vibrations. *

Many coumarin dyes are engineered as D-a—A chromophores—typically by placing a
strong electron donor at the 6/7-position (e.g., dialkylamino/alkoxy) and coupling it through

the coumarin 7-system to an electron-accepting carbonyl or cationic heteroaromatic fragment—

yielding analyte-responsive intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and enabling optical and
electrochemical sensing. !'"!4 Benzoxazolium heteroaromatics provide a rigid, electron-accepting
motif that supports planarity and extended conjugation, and are frequently used in ion-
responsive fluorescent probes; recent benzoxazole-based sensors, for example, enable cas-
cade recognition of CN~ and Fe**+.!°!” Fusing these motifs yields benzoxazolium-coumarin
(BCO*) derivatives, prototypical D-7r—A molecules with extended 7-conjugation, pronounced
ICT, and conformationally flexible scaffolds relevant to light-matter interactions and non-
linear optics. '*?° Notably, this scaffold has been deployed as a cyanide sensor, highlighting
its ICT-based reactivity and analyte sensitivity.?!

Despite extensive optical studies, systematic investigations of the low-energy IR-active
modes of BCO* in the terahertz region remain limited. Motivated by the sensitivity of
BCO? to the local environment and modulation of ICT pathways, we employ THz-TDS in
transmission to understand its low-frequency vibrational dynamics. The complex refractive

index retrieved over 0.43-2.51 THz reveals distinct resonances at 0.62, 0.85, 1.30, 1.81,
and 2.07 THz . Complementary gas-phase DFT reproduces these features and assigns them
to specific intramolecular motions involving torsion and bridge deformations within the D—
mA framework. Together, THz-TDS and DFT establish the characteristic low-frequency
modes of BCOt and suggest their relevance to modulation of ICT pathways, highlighting
the potential of THz-TDS as a sensitive probe of intramolecular interactions and analyte-

responsive dynamics in D-7—A systems.

Experimental Methods

Materials

The chemicals required for the synthesis and spectroscopic studies were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich, TCI, and Alfa Aesar and were used as received. The progress of the reac-
tions was monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on Merck silica gel 60 F 54 plates.
TH and 3C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 500 MHz FT-NMR spectrometer using
tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal reference and dimethyl sulfoxide-dg (DMSO-dg) as
the solvent. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a LAMBDA 365 UV-Vis spec-
trophotometer (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) using a quartz cuvette. Fluorescence
spectra were recorded on a Fluorolog-QM spectrofluorometer (HORIBA Scientific, Piscat-

away, NJ, USA).

Synthesis
2,3-dimethylbenzo/[d]oxazol-3-ium iodide (1).

2-methylbenzoxazole (0.025 mol) and methyl iodide (0.125 mol) were mixed in 15 mL of
acetonitrile and heated to reflux for 24 hours. After the reaction, ethyl acetate was added
to the reaction mixture to induce precipitation. The precipitate was filtered, washed with

ethyl acetate, and dried in a vacuum oven. Yield: 81%; 'H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d) 6

THz-TDS Setup

THz-TDS measurements were performed in transmission geometry. Femtosecond pulses at
790 nm (~70 fs, ~250 kHz) were supplied by a Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier (Coherent
RegA 9050). THz pulses were generated and detected by a (110)-cut ZnTe crystal. The THz

detection unit consists of (i) a quarter-wave plate, (ii) a Wollaston prism, and (iii) a home-

5
built balanced photodiode (see Fig. 1). The setup was purged with dry Ny to reduce H2O
absorption. The BCOt sample was homogenized and pressed into a pellet with thickness
d = 0.459mm (see the SI, Table $1). Repeatability of the time-domain traces is shown
in SI, Figs. S1-$2. The complex refractive index was retrieved using a standard Fresnel

transmission model. 2778

Computational Methods

All quantum-chemical calculations were performed with GAUSSIAN 16, Rev. B.01.?4 Struc-
tures were optimized at the B3LYP-D3/6-311++G(d,p) level with Grimme’s D3 dispersion
correction.” °” An ultrafine integration grid and tight SCF thresholds were used throughout;
geometry optimizations employed very-tight criteria (Opt=VeryTight) with analytical Hes-
sians at the first step (CalcFC). Vibrational frequencies confirmed true minima (no imaginary
modes). To compare with experiment, a single uniform frequency-scaling factor was applied
to the DFT values (reported with the assignments), consistent with established practice for

vibrational frequency benchmarking.?°°°
Results and Discussion

Figure 2 summarizes the experimental THz-TDS measurements. The time-domain traces
in Fig. 2a show reduced peak amplitude and a clear temporal delay for the BCO* pellet
relative to the reference, consistent with absorption and an effective refractive index near
~1.8. The corresponding Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) spectra in Fig. 2b define a usable
bandwidth of 0.43-2.51 THz, within which the main absorption features of BCO* are evident
and subsequently analyzed.

We compute the complex transmission Qexp(v) = Esam(v)/Erec(v) (Figs. 2c-2d) and
determine the complex refractive index by minimizing the error function ¢(v) in Eq. 1. In

the figures, v is reported in THz, while Eq. 1 uses SI units.

2
Cv) = , Qexp(v)| - (1)

This procedure yields the complex refractive index i(v) = n(v) +ik(v), shown in Fig. 3.
The real part n(v) (Fig. 3a) exhibits normal dispersion with changes near absorptive regions.
The extinction coefficient «(v) (Fig. 3b) reveals five principal absorption regions centered
near 0.62, 0.85, 1.30, 1.81, and 2.07 THz, and a weaker line at 1.02 THz.

To understand the nature of these vibrational modes, we performed a gas-phase DFT
analysis of BCO* at the B3LYP-D3/6-311++G(d,p) level. Normal-mode frequencies and IR.
intensities were obtained at a fully optimized minimum (no imaginary modes). To compare
with experiment on an absolute THz axis, we mapped each calculated frequency Male to the
observed value via a single least-squares scale factor, Vops = $Veaic, Which yielded s = 1.24
with RMSE = 0.0145 THz across the 0.43-2.51 THz window (see the SI, Section $3; Table
$2). After scaling, the principal simulated positions are Ps; = 0.624 THz , Ps2 = 0.843 THz ,
the Ps; doublet at {1.219, 1.336} THz , Psa = 1.790 THz , and Pss = 2.066 THz , in
good agreement with the experimentally observed modes. Inspection of the corresponding

eigenvectors indicates inter-ring torsion/libration and coupled skeletal/bridge deformations

that act along the D-7—A axis and therefore carry sizable IR intensity in the THz region.
Table 1 summarizes the IR-active modes of BCO* resolved in this work. The lowest-
frequency mode Pr at 0.62 THz is reproduced by Ps; and corresponds to an inter-ring
torsion/libration about the BCO* bridge. The second mode Pz at 0.85 THz is matched
by Psg and is best described as a ring libration with minor bridge participation. The in-
tense mode Pg3 at 1.30 THz is dominated by two intramolecular contributors (Ps3), whose
coupled skeletal/bridge character naturally modulates the ICT axis. At higher frequencies,

Pra at 1.81 THz is due to localized deformation (Ps4), and Pgs at 2.07 THz is due to

higher-frequency coupled ring deformation (Ps5). The near-uniform blue shift (single factor
s = 1.24) indicates systematic hardening of these soft modes in the solid state relative to the
gas phase; we attribute this to intermolecular constraints in the pellet—packing, local elec-
trostatics, and weak contacts—that stiffen torsional and librational coordinates. The small
residual RMSE implies that environment-induced shifts are broadly mode-independent at
this resolution, while the unassigned Py.4 = 1.02 THz feature is plausibly due to condensed-
phase activation without a gas-phase counterpart.

The BCO* derivative represents a highly polarized D-7—A molecular architecture that
facilitates ICT through an extended conjugated framework. The N,N-diethylamino group
at the 7-position of the coumarin ring acts as a strong electron donor, while the intrinsic
carbonyl functionality of coumarin and the cationic benzoxazolium fragment serve as potent
electron acceptors. The trans-vinylene linkage connecting these moieties provides a delo-
calized z-bridge that mediates efficient electronic communication between the donor and
acceptor termini. Such push-pull structures typically display large Stokes shifts because the

relaxed S$; state has pronounced ICT character; consistent with Fig. 5a, BCOt in DMSO

10
at 298 K shows Ate* = 535 nm and Am* = 620nm, yielding AA = 85nm (AE = 0.318 eV).
Additional steady-state spectra are provided in the SI (Figs. S3-S4). The broad, featureless
emission band is typical of relaxed ICT states in polar media.*!°? The HOMO/LUMO topol-
ogy (Fig. 5b) HOMO on the coumarin donor and LUMO on the benzoxazolium acceptor—
corroborates this assignment. Mechanistically, the torsional/bridge modes resolved by THz—

TDS (Ps:—Ps3) tune D-7~—A planarity and hence the ICT gap, rationalizing the large Stokes

shift observed in Fig. 5a.

Conclusion

THz-TDS reveals a set of low-energy, IR-active modes in the benzoxazolium—coumarin
(BCO*) D-r-A scaffold, with five prominent peaks at Pr; = 0.62, Pz = 0.85, Pr3 = 1.30,
Pra = 1.81, and Pes = 2.07 THz , along with a weaker unassigned feature at Py, =

1.02 THz . Gas-phase DFT IR mode calculations agree well with experiment and enable

11
the assignment of these observed modes: The Pr3 peak arises from a merged doublet within
Ps3, while Pg, and Pro originate from torsion/libration. The presence of Py4 without a
gas-phase counterpart highlights condensed-phase contributions beyond single-molecule the-
ory. Selective THz excitation of Ps;—Ps3 could enable direct tests of vibronic gating of ICT,
offering a route to control charge-transfer pathways through targeted low-frequency mode

excitation.
