ABSTRACT. We study the injective norm of random skew-symmetric tensors and the associated
fermionic quantum states, a natural measure of multipartite entanglement for systems of indistin-
guishable particles. Extending recent advances on random quantum states, we analyze both real
and complex skew-symmetric Gaussian ensembles in two asymptotic regimes: fixed particle number
with increasing one-particle Hilbert space dimension, and joint scaling with fixed filling fraction.
Using the Kac-Rice formula on the Grassmann manifold, we derive high-probability upper bounds
on the injective norm and establish sharp asymptotics in both regimes. Interestingly, a duality
relation under particle-hole transformation is uncovered, revealing a symmetry of the injective norm
under the action of the Hodge star operator. We complement our analytical results with numerical
simulations for low fermion numbers, which matches the predicted bounds.

Remark 1.1. This definition is the most natural since strictly separable skew-symmetric states do
not exist. Moreover, it follows from the usual definition. In fact, for allo € Gp, the permutation

the projector onto the skew-symmetric subspace. Then, for all T € (\? K¢*, P4(T) =T. Therefore,
coming back to the usual definition[ASI7@, [DM24] of the injective norm one has, using the skew-
symmetry of T,

by definition of the wedge product. Additionally, the set of simple wedge products has already been
formalized as the natural set of separable states for fermions, see for instance [GKM12], where more
generally, para-statistics are considered.

Motivations and main result: Different notions of entanglement for multipartite states have
been studied in the quantum information community. Among them, the geometric entanglement
has been extensively investigated in the literature [Shi95] [WG03} [AMM10b] [AMM10a| (OWBVdN14|
AST7| [FEN22\ [SG24) [DZ25]. A central aim of this work is to extend the analysis performed
in [DM24], which determines (lower bounds on) the geometric measure of entanglement of random
quantum states of distinguishable-particles, to random states of fermions. We treat two different
scaling regimes:

(1) fixed-p fermion number while letting the one-particle Hilbert space dimension d > 0.
(2) a double-scaling regime in which p,d — while the filling fraction a = p/d of the random
states is fixed asymptotically.
Following the approach of the first author in the article [DM24], we study both real and complex
skew-symmetric tensors. This puts our results within, and extends to multipartite fermionic entan-
glement, a line of work on bipartite entanglement measures for random fermionic states

(DNT22) PSA) W323).

The main results of the paper are as follows:

Theorem 1.2. Let T be a skew-symmetric random tensor over the field K, with i.i.d entries up
to antisymmetry, with entries distributed as Nig(0,1) in the case K = R and Ne(0,1) in the case
K=C. And let |Ws) := Tas where |T'|2 is the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the tensor T. Then we
have for fixed p:

and for a double scaling regime where both d,p > ©, with p = |ad| and a fixed a € (0,1):

with y(d) and Eo(p) defined in[3.7 and respectively.

Interestingly, we also uncover a duality relation for the geometric measure of entanglement of
fermionic states. The GME, like the injective norm, is invariant under particle-hole or Hodge
duality. This duality is recovered in the Kac-Rice integral and translates in the particular block
matrix structure of the random Hessian. In computing the limiting injective norm, we recover this
duality in terms of a as a symmetry of the entanglement measure under the transformation a @ 1l—a.

From a random-matrix-to-random-tensors point of view, the injective norm of a random tensor
generalizes the operator norm of a random matrix. It is therefore natural to study the behavior
of the injective norm for different random tensor ensembles, as it is natural to study the behavior
of the operator norm for different ensembles of random matrices. In the random matrix world,
several symmetry classes are investigated {For10]: real asymmetric, real symmetric, real
skew-symmetric [Kurl0], complex asymmetric, Hermitian. Those can display properties driven by
their symmetry. In the tensor world however, results concentrate on the symmetric real or real
tensors [Boe24]. But, symmetry-wise, the situation is richer.
Symmetry classes of tensors of order p are in bijection to irreducible representations of the sym-
metric group G,. Hence, it is natural to investigate the properties of random tensors in various
symmetry classes. Under this light, the case of skew-symmetric Gaussian tensors is analogous,
at least in the real case, to skew-symmetric Gaussian random matriced)| Our result can be seen
as part of a program aimed at understanding the asymptotic properties of the injective norm
of random tensors for all their possible symmetry classes. To fully achieve such a program, one
should certainly develop systematic methods to obtain asymptotically sharp bounds. While this
remains an open direction, the present work provides another example of the computation of a (con-
jecturally) sharp upper bound for a non-symmetric (here, skew-symmetric) Gaussian tensor ensemble.

The study of the injective norm is closely related to the study of the ground state in certain

disordered systems, notably spin glasses. The first steps in studying the complexity of these systems
and consequently their ground states using the Kac-Rice formula were taken in |ABAC13]. In

lwhich are themselves seldom studied, despite being a very natural Gaussian O(N) invariant ensemble
4 ON THE INJECTIVE NORM OF RANDOM FERMIONIC STATES AND SKEW-SYMMETRIC TENSORS

the authors provided precise asymptotic account of critical points at given energy levels
and revealed a complex structure near the ground state.

Building on these approaches and combining them with more recent random matrix results devel-
oped in [BABM22] [Mck24] [BBvH23}, the work studied what, in the disordered systems
world, could be considered the ground state of multispecies (eventually complex-valued) spin-glasses
and interpreted it as an injective norm or geometric measure of entanglement, thus connecting
quantum information with the former domains. High probability upper bounds were obtained in
two asymptotic regimes in the case of non-symmetric real and complex tensors with independent
Gaussian i.i.d. entries: the first regime being fixed-p and d — o and the second being fixed-d and
p— ©. One of those upper bounds was later matched with a lower bound in the real case, fixed-p

and d— © regime in [BS25].

From the point of view of Kac-Rice formula, and the landscape complexity program, one novel
aspect of our work is that we use the formula on the Grassmann manifold Gr(p, d). This is one of
several reasons why the relevant Gaussian process escapes the conditional results of coming
from the spin glass literature in the real case (and even more so in the complex case) as was already
the case of the earlier work in Remark 3.9]. It also escapes more recent results such as
'BS25} '

In parallel used asymptotic geometric analysis to produce upper bounds on p-injective
norms and general structured Gaussian tensors. Additionally, provided bounds for the
injective norm of random Gaussian tensors with independent entries having a variance profile. Both
works extend well-known random matrix results to random tensors.

Very recently, the physics work studied what they call the (signed) eigenvalue distri-
ution of random real skew-symmetric tensors using quantum field theory related methods in the
large one-particle Hilbert spaces dimension regime. This provides heuristics for the typical value
of the injective norm in this regime. This very recent work can be seen as extending the previous

physics work [Sas24].

Organization: The paper is organized in a way that mostly mimics the organization of [DM24].
In fact, the proof of our main theorem is built around very similar ideas. In Section 2, we introduce
he definitions related to quantum information and random matrix theory. We also present some
undamental properties of the defined concepts, which we use frequently in the paper. In Section 3,
we prove the results for the real case in both asymptotic regimes. Section 4 deals with the proofs in
he complex case. The proofs follow the line of logic of the real case, with only small differences.
All proofs in these two sections rely heavily on [AEKN19| (DM24]. Finally,
in Section 5 we present some numerical simulations that match our analytical results in the first
asymptotic regime. This section can be seen as an extension of the work [FEN22]. The appendix
contains details about the geometric properties of the Grassmann manifold and the calculation of
the correlation functions necessary in the Kac-Rice formula.

2.1. Random matrix models and their properties. We here recall the definition of the BHGOE
ensemble introduced in [DM24]. Building on that we introduce the BHGAE ensemble and show
that their operator norm is bounded from above.

Definition 2.1 (Injective norm of a skew-symmetric tensor). Let K be C or R for the remainder of
the paper. The injective norm of a skew-symmetric tensor T € (Ke) can be defined by:

To turn T into a quantum state we normalize it by defining T:

the complex setting.

Lemma 2.3. In the real case, the squared Hilbert-Schmidt norm of a skew-symmetric tensor T is
distributed as p! times a x? random variable with (°) degrees of freedom. In the complex case, tt

has the same law as B times a x-distribution with 2(4) degrees of freedom. For any x > 0, the
following concentration inequalities hold for the real and complex case

d pid!

(14) real case: P (ine < Gp! Qn fi) < exp(—2”)

complex case: P (ine < c I _ afte) < exp(—2”)

In particular the mean = ; behaves asymptotically as follows for the two cases of (fized p, d > 0)

and (fixed a € (0,1),p = |ad|, d—> %):

(15) (fired p, d+ ce): (ITI) = @(1+0(5))

(fived p = [ad], d— «&): (IT 2) = aeertottt-ayint-oe( +0 (4)

Proof. In the real case, the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of a random skew-symmetric tensor is a random
variable given as:

(16) IT =p! DY) Tho,
iW<<tp

We can define the sum as a random variable S = )); , 7? ;, which is a y? distribution with
1<i<ip Ti1,..5ip?

(’) degrees of freedom. After this, equation and the identity E(|T|?.) = 1 = follow directly

from [ZM00} lemma 1]. Using Stirling’s formula in the large-d limit of the fixed-p regime, the mean
becomes:

(17) lim E(T|2) = a (1 +0 (4)
Furthermore, for the double-scaling behavior of E(|T'|3) (73) Tess (d—i), one obtains,
pol p—1
log (E(|T'|3)) = > log(d—i) < I log(d — x)da
i=0 =

[ad log d — d(a + (1— a) log(1 — a))] (1 + 0(1)).

A lower bound comes

p=1 —p

ad log d — dla + (1 — a) log(1— a)].

Therefore, we obtain the asymptotic behavior,

(18) (\T 3) _ dete (ot (1-a) log(1-a))d (2 bug (;)) ,

which proves equation (15) for the real case.
In the complex case, we have E(|T'|3) = BSc with Sc being a y? distribution with 2(4) degrees of
freedom. The rest of the calculation is similar and leads to the same result (15). Applying [[M00}
lemma 1] yields the complex part of (14).

ON THE INJECTIVE NORM OF RANDOM FERMIONIC STATES AND SKEW-SYMMETRIC TENSORS 7

2.1.1. Properties of injective norm of fermions and their geometric entanglement. The injective
norm naturally leads to the definition of the geometric measure of entanglement (GME) as:

(19 GME((|¢>) = —2log(| |p) llinj)-

We now recall the definition of the Hodge dual

Pp d—p
(20) *: /\ Rt AR |b) = > Wolo, A A Co, > *|Y) = > Valo A A Cot _,
o¢([d])p o¢([d])p
where o is an injective (i.e. non-repeating) p-tuple from the set {1,...,d}. Since the order of the

components of o is important, we only consider, without loss of generality, o such that 01 <...< dp.
Furthermore, we assign to each p-tuple a (d—p)-tuple o° and we require it to have an ordering such
that {o1,...,0p,0f .-.,04_p} is an even permutation of {1,...,d}.

Example 2.4. Let o = (1,3) andaeé (a) then o° is ordered as o° = (4,2) since (1,3,4,2) is an
even permutation of (1,2, 3,4).

Given a state of p fermions 77 the Hodge dual maps it to a state of d—p fermions |q,) = * |Wf),
by swapping the filled and empty dimensions.

Proof. The Hodge dual preserves the Hermitian inner product up to a sign. Let |Ws) € A? C4 bea

given in the definition of the injective norm of |7,).
Denote |) := *|yp) the hole state dual to |W») in (7. Then one has

the Hodge dual, we have

where [#(y1 A... A Ya—p)] € Gr(p, d) which leads to a contradiction.

We now examine how the random function fr transforms under Hodge duality in a neighborhooc
of the "north pole" of the Grassmannian.
For this case, we first look at the transformation of the neighborhood itself under the action of
Hodge star operator, that is U > *U with U c Gr(p,d) and *U c Gr(d—p,d). For a small enough
t the coordinates of a basis vector in the chart described in the Appendix [A] can be displayed as:

M= d—
i = A
te p)xp |>

where gine is the (d—p) x p-matrix with 1 in the ij-th entry and zeros everywhere else. The
point described by these coordinates corresponds to the space spanned by:

€1 A we A (05 + tepyi) As A Cp:

This wedge product under the action of the Hodge operator is transformed to
—Ept1 A. A Cppi-1 A (Cox + te;) A Cp+itl A +++ A Cd;

which in the matrix form is presented as:

px (d—p)
M = (a
(ap)

Using the fact that Hodge operator is linear, it can be shown that the matrix B ¢ R(¢-?)*P
representing a point on the chart of U is transformed into BT € R?*‘4-?) on the chart of «U under
the pushforward of the Hodge duality and therefore the correlations of the functions and their
derivatives as we calculated in Appendix [B] are preserved under the action of the Hodge operator.

Definition 2.6. A BHGOE(d, p, 0?) random matrix is a pd x pd real-symmetric random matrix,
thought of as being partitioned into p* blocks of size d x d, with the diagonal blocks set to zero,
and the remaining entries are independent up to symmetry, each distributed according to a normal
distribution N(0,07). In other words, such a matrix is a GOE matrix with the diagonal blocks zeroed
out.

For all m,k € Z,, we define the partial transpose T : Mat,(C) @ Matm(C) + Mat,(C) ® Matm(C)
as the map Id@t where t : Matm(C) — Matm(C) denotes the transpose of a matrix. Let N = p(d—p)
and let the family EY be the standard matrix basis elements of Mat,(C) (that is, Ee)

ij is the p x p
matrix with a one at position (i,j) and zeros everywhere else).

Definition 2.7 (Block Hollow Gaussian Antisymmetric Ensemble). Let d,p€ Zso and let Ay be a
N x N BHGOE(d,p,o”) random matrix. Then,

An = > tay @Gij + EP @ Gj),
1<i<j<p
where the Gi, are independent dx d random matrices whose elements are independent and distributed
according to a normal distribution N (0,07).
We define Wn to a be an BHGAE(d,p,o7) as being the partial antisymmetrization of An

Ww := —<(An — Ad),

where Ah is the partial transpose of An, so that formally,

Ak= ¥ (EP @Gi,+ B% @Gi,s).

1<i<j<p

By construction, Wy consists of p? blocks, with vanishing diagonal blocks. We index the elements
of Wy by pairs of doublets (i, a), (j, 8), where i,j determine the block and a, 8 the line and column
inside a block. A given non trivial block (i, 7) is a skew-symmetric random matrix. Its independent
elements (Wy) (i,a),(j,3) for a < 6 are N(0, a”) random variables, while the elements on the diagonal
of a block vanish.

We use the work to obtain the following. The proof is very similar to what can be found

in [DM24| Lemma 2.3 & Corollary 2.4]

Proof. The proof of the proposition is very similar to the one given in the appendix of [DM24]. The
only difference arises from the particularities of the geometry of the Grassmann manifold. Some
considerations regarding the specific geometry of the Grassmannian and its volume are shown in
the appendix [A] and in particular lemma

3.1. Real, fixed p, d— .

Theorem 3.2 (Main theorem - real case). Let p > 3 be a fixed integer and let T € \? R¢ be a

on the annealed complexity log E(Crt s,(B)) of the Gaussian process fr expressed in proposition

[3-4] for B < (Eo(p), +2).
The assumptions of [BABM22| Theorem 4.1] are checked in proposition [3.4]

The upper bound on the injective norm follows from the application of the Markov inequality to the
probability P (Crt ,,((Eo(p) + ¢,0)) > 1). Formally,

This finishes the proof.

In particular, we recall the necessary assumptions (see [BABM22) theorem 1.2] and its assumptions)
that we have to check:

(1) Control of the Wasserstein distance: Let pyy(u) = wees 5y,(Hy(u)) be the empirica
spectral measure of the Hessian. According to Theorem 4.1 & Theorem 1.2], one
needs to show that Ja > 0 such that Wi (E(jyy(u))s Mp(u)) < N~™.

(2) Concentration of Lipschitz trace: One needs to prove that for every Lipschitz function
f:R-—R, 4C,c> 0 such that ,

(3) Gap assumption:

and as was realized through lemma 3.11 in |DM24J, one only needs this property to be true

for |u| large enough.
We also need specifically from theorem 4.1]

(4) There exists C > 0 such that E (|det(H(u))|) < (C'max(|u|,1))* together with the map
u+> Hy(u) being entrywise continuous (in our case it is just a translation of the diagonal
elements by u).

In fact, letting A := (—9, —Eo(p)) uv (Eo(p), ©), one shows,

Proposition 3.4. Let Hy(u) = u— Wy, where Wy is a BHGAE. Then properties [7] iB} are
satisfied for allué R. Assuming ue KC A closed, property [3] is also satisfied.

Proof. The proof consists in checking that the arguments proving lemma 3.15, lemma 3.16 and
lemma 3.17 in [DM24] can be adapted. In fact, property 2], the concentration of Lipschitz trace,

is obtained as a consequence of the Herbst argument, which can also here be adapted from |AGZ10)

difference in this case is the argument that supy E[|Wy |] < © , which is shown in proposition

Property |1|is obtained in the same way, as in |DM24]. To this aim we need to import the local

is sufficient to prove[]]

We now come to property Due to the presence of structural zeros in the Hessian it is not
possible to obtain a bound on the probability of occurrence of very small singular values for any
value of u with available techniques in the literature. However, as was found in [DM24], the trick is

to work on the event Ex := {I Wn < 24/ pot + ic} for K <A, where dx = d(K,.A) is the distance

between K and A. In fact, conditioned on this event, the spectrum of Hessfy is gapped away from
14 ON THE INJECTIVE NORM OF RANDOM FERMIONIC STATES AND SKEW-SYMMETRIC TENSORS

zero (i.e. the spectrum of Hessfy is at distance at least dx of 0). This translates into the lower
bound

inf P(Spec(Hess fv) a [-e™ ,e™] = @) = PlEx).

One then has from proposition [2.3] that limy_,~ P(Ex) = 1. Proving the necessary gap property.
Property [4s proved exactly the same way as in [BABM24| Lemma 4.4] and [DM24| Lemma 3.18].

proof of lemma 3.22 in [DM24].

4. COMPLEX CASE

The structure of the proof in the complex case closely parallels that of the real case. We propose
an alternative but equivalent definition of the injective norm, which is more convenient to work with.
Moreover, we demonstrate that this definition admits an upper bound via the Kac-Rice formula. As
in the real case, due to the homogeneity of the Hessian on the complex Grassmannian shown in
lemma [B-1] the Kac-Rice integral can be decomposed into two parts: a volume contribution and
a determinant contribution arising from the integrand. Each of these contributions can then be
evaluated analogously to the real case.

Lemma 4.1. Let T be a skew-symmetric d-dimensional random tensor of order p. The function

Tia) r...na?) 7 Ref (Tir a... na?)

fr(a@,...,2@)) = See has the same maximum as gr(a,...,2)) = Rel ean
and thus the injective norm of T can be given as the maximum of gr.

Proof. First, observe that for any set of vectors {a),...,2)} in C4, we have fr(x™,...,a)) >

gr(a@™,...,2")), Therefore, it suffices to show that there exists {y}; such that gr(y™, y)) =

max fr. Let {c}; maximize fr and let @ denote the phase of (T,a a... 0 x ?)) before taking
ON THE INJECTIVE NORM OF RANDOM FERMIONIC STATES AND SKEW-SYMMETRIC TENSORS 17

the absolute value. Thus setting y@ = e~®2 and yG = a) provides the set such that
gr(y,...,y®) = max fr.

the real Grassmannian with the complex Grassmannian, which leads us to use Vol(U(n)) instead o:
Vol(O(n)), as shown in Appendix [A] Any other detail remains the same.

4.1. Complex, fixed p, d— 0.

Theorem 4.3 (Complex, skew-symmetric, p-fixed, d > 0). Let Te A? C% be a random skew-
symmetric tensor with i.i.d. Nc(0,1) entries. Then for every ¢ > 0, we have:

il
(62) lim ——— log L(p, d) = 5

do 2p(d— p)
Proof. The proof of this lemma is very similar to that of Lemma [3.3] with the only difference in
the fact that the non-T contributions in eq. (58) appear with a power of two compared to Lemma
while the arguments of the ['-contributions are scaled by the factor of two. A straightforward
calculation shows that these differences yield an overall factor of two in log L which is canceled by
dividing by 2p(d— p) (as appropriate in the complex case) rather than p(d — p). Thus, the limiting
expression matches that of the real case.

Next, we verify that all the necessary properties established in the real case also hold for a
cBHGAE matrix.

Proposition 4.5. Let Hy(u) = u—Ww, where Wyn is a cBHGAE random matrix. Then, properties
fa are satisfied for allué R. Assuming ue K CA, with K closed, property [5| is also satisfied.

Proof. Property 3 and 4 carry over directly from the real case. The Herbst argument for property
2 requires the boundedness of the operator norm of cBHGAE, which follows from proposition
The rest of the argument remains unchanged.

Regarding property 1, in the complex case, the matrix Dyson equations are derived the same way
18 ON THE INJECTIVE NORM OF RANDOM FERMIONIC STATES AND SKEW-SYMMETRIC TENSORS

The remainder of the proof follows as in the proof of proposition [3.4] and 3.16].

4.2. Complex, double scaling. The complex case with p = |ad| and d > © is likewise analogous
to the real case. We introduce a sequence whose asymptotic behavior determines the upper bound
of interest. Then, applying Laplace’s method, we show that the Kac-Rice integral converges to the
same asymptotic limit. To that end, we state the following lemmas without proof, referring the
reader to the corresponding arguments in the real case:

Lemma 4.6. Fixing a, for every d there exists a unique Yo(d) = yS(d) > 0 satisfying:

The next lemma describes the asymptotic behavior of the Kac-Rice integral:

Then, the following holds:

canceled by factor 2 in the denominator of PCEOE giving the same limiting result as in the rea!

case.

And finally the upper bound in this case is given by:

Theorem 4.9 (Complex, skew-symmetric, double scaling, p,d > ©). For a fixed a € (0,1), let
p= |ad| and Te A? C4 be a random skew-symmetric tensor with entries that are i.i.d. Nc(0,1)

The proof of this theorem follows that of the real case. It relies on complex analogues of Lemma 3.7]

and Lemma B.8} which are stated above. Given the results established above, the proof proceeds

identically to the real case and follows the argument in |DM24].

5. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

To validate our analytical results in the case of finite p, we use the numerical methods implemented
in [FLN22]. These simulations are carried out for both real and complex skew-symmetric tensors,
with tensor orders p = 2,3,4. As anticipated, the results in both the real and complex settings closely
match, supporting the asymptotic behavior that we obtain. Although simulations are performed
for both real and complex tensors of orders p = 2,3 and 4, we display the complex-case results
only for p = 3, as a representative example. The behavior in the p = 2 or 4 cases is quantitatively
indistinguishable from the real-case simulations, both in terms of convergence and the limiting
bounds, and is therefore omitted to avoid redundancy. This reinforces the observation that the real
and complex cases exhibit identical large-d behavior in all tested orders. We do not extend the
simulations to higher orders p > 4, as the memory and runtime requirements grow prohibitively with
both tensor order and ambient dimension, making large-scale sampling computationally infeasible
in that regime.

In each case, we report the normalized injective norm of a random skew-symmetric tensor T, defined

as
[Zing

(d-p)
This observable is expected to remain bounded in the large-d limit. We employ two numerical
approaches for estimating the injective norm, depending on the tensor order:

e For p = 2, the norm reduces to the largest singular value of the associated skew-symmetric
matrix and can therefore be computed exactly via singular value decomposition.
e For p> 2, we use the gradient descent to obtain the approximate maximum value

FIGURE 2. Comparison of the values of the injective norm for random tensors of
order 2, 3 and 4 as a function of the dimension d. The asymptotic analytical upper
bound is indicated by the blue line.

The number of samples used in the simulations varies with p and d, primarily due to the memory
demands of storing and optimizing high-order tensors:

e For p= 2: 200 samples for all d

e For p= 3: 100 samples for d < 250, and 20 samples for d > 250

e For p= 4: 100 samples for d < 70, and 10 samples for d > 70
These choices reflect the computational cost of statistical precision, especially as both the rank and
ambient dimension increase. However, in the large-dimensional limit, the self-averaging behavior
of the injective norm leads to suppressed statistical fluctuations, partially mitigating the effect of

reduced sample sizes.
We compare the simulation results against the theoretical upper bounds predicted by our analysis.

These are given by:

APPENDIX A. GRASSMANNIAN GEOMETRY

In this section, we briefly review the fundamental geometric properties of the Grassmann manifold
relevant to our work. The topics discussed are mostly standard and well-known results and
constructions. Our exposition closely follows the treatment provided in and the references
therein. We begin by presenting the normal coordinates on the Grassmannian around a reference
point. We then discuss its structure as a homogeneous space and derive its volume, which will be
used in the main text.

In general the Grassmannian Gr(p, d) is defined as the set of all p-dimensional subspaces of the
d-dimensional vector space C4 or R¢.

Definition A.1. Formally, for K = R or C, the Grassmannian can be defined as:
(70) Gr(p,d) = {P € K™4|P? = P, P? = P, rank P = p}.

Equivalently, these projectors can be expressed for the real Grassmannian as:

(71) Cte = {or i ) O

cco).

with complex conjugate and U(d) replacing transpose and O(d) for the complex Grassmannian. The

matrix Po = {°? 0 plays a central role and will serve as our reference point on the Grassmannian

0
in the subsequent discussion. Pp represents the subspace spanned by the first p basis vectors. This is

reminiscent of the north pole (1,0,...,0) € S” being used in many works as a reference point.[DM24]

Lemma A.2. The volume of the real Grassmann manifold is given as:
Vol(O(d))
Vol(O(p)) Vol(O(d — p))
The volume of the complex Grassmann manifold is given by:
Vol(U(d))
Vol(U(p)) VolU (d — p))

(72) Vol( Gr(p, d))

(73) Vol Gre(p, d))

A proof of this lemma can be found in , consistent with the construction of the Grassmannian
as a homogeneous space.

A.1. Normal coordinates and non-compact Stiefel manifold. In particular, one can explicitly
define normal coordinates around the Po, i.e. the subspace spanned by the first p canonical basis
vectors. The tangent-space at this point is homeomorphic to R(-P)*P_ Thus, any point in the
tangent space can be represented as a d— p by p matrix Be R(¢-P)*?. Tt is useful to define for each
=~ ~ I,
matrix Be R(-?)*? a matrix Be RX? with B= b),
Furthermore, the coordinate map is given by
(76) g:U>R™4, Be B(BTB)'BT
where U is an open neighborhood around zero in R‘¢?)*?, Here, each point on the Grassmannian is
represented by the orthogonal projector onto the corresponding subspace. Note that this projection
matrix corresponds precisely to the subspace spanned by the columns of B.
Since the integrand in the Kac-Rice formula is independent of the choice of point (as shown in
Lemma|B.1) we can focus instead on the pullback of f from by the map y, y*f(B) = f(y(B))
in R(-))*? and evaluate it as such in the neighborhood U, and multiply the result by the volume
of the Grassmannian. In particular, y* f(B) = f(y(B)) can be written as:

1 T(b1,..., bx)
P(d — P) , /det(BTB)

(77) g* fr(B)

with b; being the i-th column of B.

APPENDIX B. COMPUTATION OF HESSIAN AND OTHER CORRELATIONS

We begin with the real case and, for convenience, write f instead of y*f under an abuse

of notation. On the tangent space of the point Po, let X,Y ¢ R-?)*P we have X = (%)

Y
expectation value E[f(X)f(Y)] is then given as:
1 det[X‘Y
P(A P) , [aet[X*X] det [YY ]

and Y = (?) whose columns span the corresponding vector subspace of y(X) and y(Y). The

Lemma B.1. Considering the integrand of the Kac-Rice formula derived from the function fr on
the Grassmann manifold Gr(p, d):

(79) I(x) = E(|det Hess f(x)|1p(e)efts t2]  VF(®) = ev yey(0),

then function J : Gr(p,d) > R is constant across the Grassmann manifold.

ON THE INJECTIVE NORM OF RANDOM FERMIONIC STATES AND SKEW-SYMMETRIC TENSORS 23

Proof. First we define the Hessian as a (1, 1)-tensor on the manifold. (Hessf);; = Vi(grad fr); where
V is the Levi-Civita connection on the manifold. The determinant of the Hessian, defined in this
way, is invariant under any coordinate transformation. Furthermore, the condition Vf = grad f = 0
is invariant under any change of coordinate. Finally it remains to check that the covariance of
function fr is invariant under the action of O(d) which transfers one point of the Grassmannian to
another. This is clear from the equation and its invariance under X¥ + OX and Y > OY.

Correlations of the random function f and its derivatives: Taking the derivative with
respect to one of the coordinates yields the following tangent-function correlation:

Of(X
(80) | : Pro] =0
Cx; X=Y=0
The next relevant correlation is:
Of(X) Of (Y i
ray #) 0404) =) 9g,
ac! ay \\y_yig P(d- P)

We now consider the correlation between the Hessian and the gradient:

=0

(82) z | F(X) of(Y)

ax) ax) ay?

X=Y=0

Finally, we compute the covariance of the Hessian entries:

(83) F(X) éF(¥) Loy
ax) aa) aye ay Poet, p(d —p)

(6% oon dn + 510" 5nd jn — 98° Sdn — 3M" d + 595i; 51)

Furthermore for the complex case, one can show that:

(Re{ f(X)} Ref f(Y)}) = 4 (Re{H( F(X) FY))} + Re{E(f(X) #(Y))}), where due to the choice of
he distributions the second term vanishes. Now we compute the correlation functions of derivatives
of Re{ f(X)}, following the same procedure as in the real case, up to second order. Note, however,
hat in the complex case, derivatives can be taken with respect to the real or imaginary parts of
each variable. To clarify this, we define:

pt nA 1 290
a = ay +ig;

gt — 7a pom:
Y= OF 1G

Accordingly, the correlation function becomes:
1 Re{det[XTY]}
det[XtX] det[YTY]

(84) E[Re{ f(X)} Ref f(Y)}]

Here, we have used the same coordinate charts as in the real case to define X and Y.
As in the real case, the gradient and Hessian of the function can be expressed as centered Gaussian
