Quantum computation with d-level quantum systems, also known as qudits, benefits from the
possibility to use a richer computational space compared to qubits. However, for arbitrary qudit-
based hardware platform the issue is that a generic qudit operation has to be decomposed into the
sequence of native operations — pulses that are adjusted to the transitions between two levels in a
qudit. Typically, not all levels in a qudit are simply connected to each other due to specific selection

rules.

Moreover, the number of pulses plays a significant role, since each pulse takes a certain

execution time and may introduce error. In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient algorithm to
decompose single-qudit operations into the sequence of pulses that are allowed by qudit selection
rules. Using the developed algorithm, the number of pulses is at most d(d—1)/2 for an arbitrary
single-qudit operation. For specific operations the algorithm could produce even fewer pulses. We
provide a comparison of qudit decompositions for several types of trapped ions, specifically 17 Yb*,

STBat, Cat, ®°Rb* with different selection rules, and also

lecomposition for superconducting

qudits. Although our result deal with single-qudit operations, the proposed approach is important

for realizing two-qudit operations since they can be implemente
is surrounded by efficiently implemented single-qudit gates.

I. INTRODUCTION

The development of a large-scale quantum com-
puter [1-3] that is able to outperform devices based on
classical principles in practically relevant problems, such
as simulating complex (quantum) systems [4], combina-
torial optimization [5], or prime factorization [6], repre-
sents an outstanding challenge. Various computational
models, for example, digital quantum computing [1, 2],
variational quantum algorithms [7, 8], or programmable
uantum simulation [9], and diverse physical platforms,
such as superconducting circuits [10, 11], semiconductor
uantum dots [12-14], optical systems [15, 16], neutral
atoms [9, 17-19], and trapped ions [20-22], are under
study on the way to useful quantum computers. The
inherent idea is to find suitable conditions for scaling
uantum devices with respect to the number of available
information carriers without significantly degrading the
ality of the control. In the most well-developed digital
model of quantum computing, information carriers are
ubits [1-3], which are two-level quantum counterparts
of classical bits. The execution of quantum algorithms
requires the realization of single- and two-qubit opera-
tions under a register of qubits, so that the combination
of the number of qubits and quality of quantum opera-
ions (gates) is the crucial parameter.

Underlying physical platforms, such as trapped ions
or neutral atoms, however, almost always have Hilbert
spaces of higher dimensionalities, which gives interesting
possibilities [23].Computing models based on the use of
additional degrees of freedom of physical systems, which
makes them qudits (where d indicates that the dimen-
sion of the Hilbert space may be larger than two), at-
ract great interest since they allow scalability of quan-
um computing devices without the need for an increase
in the number of physical carriers [2462]. There are
several approaches to how qudits can be used for more
efficient quantum processors. First, one can think about

as a standard two-qubit gate that

a multilevel system with 2™ levels as a set of qubits:
for example, a ququart is equivalent to a two-qubit sys-
em [63-65]. At the same time, implementing a two-
qubit operation with a single ququart (strictly speak-
ing, this is a single-qudit operation) would not require
physical interaction between physical objects, so the fi-
delity of such operation can be as high as the fidelity
of single-qubit operation. The second approach is the
use of additional qudit levels to substitute ancilla qubits
in multiqubit gate decompositions [66] (for example, for
he Toffoli gate [36, 38, 40, 43, 67-73]). However, the ef-
ficiency of these methods and their combination depends
on the mapping, i.e. the way in which qubits are encoded
in qudits (63, 65].

As in the case of conventional qubit-based processors,
the choice of a specific physical platform is also impor-
tant for qudit setups. Recently, multiqudit quantum
processors [74-77], including systems based on supercon-
ducting transmon qubits [74] and photons [75] as well as
*°Cat [76] and 17 Yb* [77] ion qudits, have been demon-
strated. It is clear that in the case of atomic qubits (ions
or neutral atoms), qudit encoding is natural due to multi-
evel structures, and it is straightforward to address more
chan two levels using a single laser with acousto-optic
modulators (AOMs) [76, 77]. Superconducting [78, 79]
and photonic [80] systems are also promising for qudit-
based quantum computing. Recent progress in quantum
computing with qudits also includes the demonstration
of a significant improvement in the realization of mul-
iqubit gates [81, 82] and quantum algorithms with qu-
dits (39, 78]. However, various details of resource-efficient
implementation of quantum algorithms with qudits are
che subject of research.

In this work, we address a specific problem of the re-
alization of single-qudit operations, taking into account
selection rules of physical systems. The objective is to
minimize the number of pulses in order to realize a single-
qudit operation, since such a minimization would result
in shorter execution time and lower amount of errors. We
propose a resource-efficient algorithm to decompose qudit
operations into the sequence of pulses that are allowed by
qudit selection rules. As we demonstrate, in the proposed
algorithm the number of pulses is at most d(d—1)/2 for an
arbitrary single-qudit operation, or even fewer pulses for
specific single-qudit operations. We provide a compari-
son of qudit decompositions for several types of trapped
ions, specifically 17} Yb*, 87Ba*, 4°Cat, ®°Rb* with dif-
ferent selection rules, and also decomposition for super-
conducting qudits.

II. QUDIT COMPUTING

A common quantum device relies on operations with
qubits, i.e. the set of transformations of two-level systems
in the superposition states:

Ib) qh = Vo |0) + 1/1). (1)

In the case of qudits, the structure of the superposition
state of the d-level quantum system is more complex:

/

baa

Wo |0) +--+:

d-1

n=0

where d is the dimension of the quantum state.

The evolution of a qudit state can be described using
unitary operators, similarly to the case of qubit opera-
tors. For example, if we interpret qubit Pauli o, as an
operation that swaps two levels, then we obtain:

SWAP Ya = li) (| + 1d) + SE Irp (m].(3)
n#i,j

On the other hand, a; can be generalized to modulo d
increment:

Xqa = > \n+1 mod d) (n], (4)

Xka = Do [ntk mod d) (n|. (5)
i

Also, one can use phase gates Zga and the d-nary
Hadamard transform Haas which is equivalent to the
Quantum Fourier Transform on a single qudit:

Zqa = > 2" In) (n), (6)

Haa = Doe In) (ma, (7)

nym

where w = e’?*/4 is the d™ root of unity.
In general, any single-qudit evolution can be described
using elements of the unitary group Ugg € U(d). This

group is isomorphic to the group of dxd matrices with
complex entries that satisfy the unitary condition:

Uo Uor Uo,a-1
No Una Ui ,a-1

Uga = : ‘ . (8)
Ua-1,0 Ua-11 +++ Ua-1,a-1

d-1
Uga'Uga =ld = Un Uk, = Snm (9)
k=0

The knowledge of how to efficiently implement arbi-
trary single-qudit evolution with existing qudit hard-
ware is the crucial step towards the universal qudit com-
puter. Especially, for the systems with high dimension-
ality [78, 79, 83-85].

Another important part of computation with qudits
is entangling operations. Using the extension of Pauli
operations to qudits, we obtain the analogues of qubit
controlled gates, particularly CX and CZ:

d-1
CUga = > |m) (m| ® Ufa. (10)
m=0
CXqa = > |, n-+m) (m,n), (11)
CZga = Dw” |m,n) (m,nJ. (12)

myn

Also, on several trapped-ion platforms the main two-

qudit operation is Mglmer-Sgrensen gate [79, 85, 86]:

MS (x) = exp {-% (of @14+1@ on')”} (13)
g Cx Oy ,

which is equivalent up to global phase to qubit RXX op-
eration on the subspace {|00) ,|01) ,|10) , |11)}:

RXX (x) = exp {-tx gz @ on}. (14)

Although we do not consider qudit entangling opera-
tions within the scope of this paper, however, we are able
to embed n-qubit gates into a single-qudit operation if
@22".

Ill. QUDIT HARDWARE OPERATIONS

From the experimental point of view, the qudit sys-
tem can be implemented using different physical systems:
trapped ions, neutral atoms, superconducting circuits,
photonic circuits, etc.

A qudit state can be encoded into ions’ or neutral
atoms’ degrees of freedom, e.g. states of the electron
on the outer shell [84, 85, 87]. In this model, each state
|n) has the corresponding energy E,,. After applying the
laser field with a frequency ; |E; — Ej|, the Rabi oscilla-
tion of the electron between states |i) and |j) is stimu-
lated if this transition is permitted by selection rules.

Superconducting circuits are able to store qudit states
as Fock states of Copper pairs in the potential well [78,
79]. Transitions between states are also stimulated via
Rabi pulses between neighboring states |n) and |n+1).
The potential well should provide some degree of anhar-
monicity so that each transition can be addressed indi-
vidually.

Photonic circuits can represent a qudit state using d-
wire schemes with a single photon [75, 80]. An index of
the basis qudit state represents the index of the wire. Us-
ing the beam-splitter with a given amplitude reflection
rate r (it is usually set r=1/,/2 for a half-transparent
mirror), we can permute photons in two neighboring
Also, we can perform a phase-shift of a single
wire at an arbitrary angle.

We can note that every mentioned qudit platform sup-
ports two main types of operations. The first is the phase
shift on the level |k), which we denote P* (6). The second
is a two-level transition RY (0,@) between levels |i) and
\7). These operations have the following definitions:

wires.

P* (0) = exp {0 k) (rl }, (15)
R" (0,6) = exp {-«502} ; (16)

where o¢’ is the qudit analogue of qubit Pauli operators
acting on the two-level subspace {|7) ,|j)} of qudit:

oe = 15) Gl +18) Gl, (17)
oy = els) Gl — ele) Gi, (18)
oy =e 15) i teh) GI. (19)

Thus, R operation can be viewed as 2x2 unitary matrix
R that acts on subspace spanned by {|7) ,|7)}:

cos ($) —ue'? sin (4)
—tet? sin (4) cos (8)

Several platforms may lack two-parametric transition
operations, e.g. for photonic circuits there is only a single
parameter r in the beam-splitter operation:

r -vI=7
vi-r vr |

We may always apply phase shifts and transform this
operation into R” operation:

Rd (9,6) = PA (o - =) o Ti (cos $) o Pd (5 - ) .
(22)
We also consider arbitrary selection rules for a given
qudit physical implementation that permit applicable RY
operations. In the following sections, we demonstrate

R (6,6) = | (20)

T(r) = | (21)

that any qudit operation U can be decomposed into the
sequence of allowed R“ and P* operations. Moreover,
for any selection rules, we guarantee at most d(d—1)/2
transition operations R”! in the final decomposition.

IV. UNITARY DECOMPOSITION FOR
TRAPPED-ION AND SUPERCONDUCTING
HARDWARE

Existing decomposition schemes utilize superconduct-
ing selection rules: transitions are allowed only for neigh-
boring states. Two distinct schemes are provided in [88]
(Row-by-row scheme for superconducting circuits) and
in [89] (Square scheme for photonic circuits). Both
schemes perform unitary decomposition by eliminating
non-diagonal entries from unitary matrix U using a se-
quence of two-level R operations.

In these decompositions, we initialize the algorithm
with a unitary dxd matrix. After right-applying a two-
level operation R°! (—6,,¢1) to U, elements of the first
two columns are modified in the following way:

By choosing proper values for parameters 6, and ¢), we
can set a single element of the first column U//_, 9 to 0:

In the next steps, we apply operations R"~!” in or-
der to eliminate element Ug—1,n—1 using element Ug_1n-
After d—1 steps, all elements in a row d—1 are elim-
inated. Due to the unitary property, all elements in
a column d-—1 are also eliminated and the diagonal
element has absolute value 1. With the phase gate
P4—1 (aq_1 = arg(Ua_1,a-1)) we obtain the following de-
composition:

o P*! (ag_1) 0 RO 4? (64-1, ¢a-1)° (27)
Orr 0

oR? (42, 62) 0 R°t (1,41).

After eliminating the row, we can repeat the same al-
gorithm on the lesser (d—1) x (d—1) unitary matrix Uj_,.
The full row elimination scheme for superconducting qu-
dit is depicted in Figure la.

If we want to implement the similar algorithm on the
trapped-ion quantum computer [87] with d = 4 levels,
we face the following issue. Consider the device operating

with transitions 01, 02, 03, whereas the given decomposi-
tion scheme operates with 01, 12, 23. The naive approach
requires using level-swap operations that transform any
transition R into the allowed transition R:
RY (8,6) = S™ oR” (0,4) 0S”,
or (28)
RY (8,6) = So R® (6,4) 0S”,

(29)

si = RY (n,7) = [ ma

1 0

However, using this strategy for arbitrary unitary, we
obtain 12 trapped-ion native transitions, instead of 6 as
for superconducting qudit. The best we can get using
level-swaps is 8 native transitions. This number will grow
with d more rapidly, than < d(d—1)/2 estimation for a
superconducting qudit.

Hence, we should deduce the most optimal decomposi-
tion scheme for trapped-ion qudits, which typically have
a star-like level transition scheme. In general, we con-
sider d levels trapped-ion qudit with transitions R°” or
R™°, where 0 <n <d. The main idea of our algorithm
is to eliminate all row elements Uy_1,, for 0 <n <d
using the zeroeth element Uy_1,9. Then, apply R°4-! to
eliminate the zeroeth element as well. The full row elim-
ination scheme for trapped-ion qudit unitary is depicted
in Figure 1b.

Row elimination for dxd unitary requires at most
(d—1)x R and 1x P gates. In total, after decomposing all

lesser matrices, we obtain d(d—1)/2x R and dx P gates
in unitary decomposition. Though some 6, parameters
could be equal 0 (if eliminated elements are already = 0),
hence these operations can be omitted in the hardware
execution. Also, on both considered platforms, phase
gates P can be performed virtually, so their amount in
the decomposition does not affect execution time as much
as transition gates R.

V. UNITARY DECOMPOSITION FOR QUDIT
WITH ARBITRARY SELECTION RULES

Our goal is to generalize the considered decomposi-
tion schemes to the case of arbitrary selection rules. A
specific decomposition pattern could be spotted in the
earlier proposed schemes. We apply d—1 operations in
order to eliminate all non-diagonal terms. Each R op-
eration requires an additional non-zero row element to
perform elimination. This pattern to eliminate a row r
could be described in a more formal way:

e On each step we apply R*?! gate, where z; is the
index of eliminated element in row and p; is the
index of pivot element that used to eliminate z;;

e 2;,p; must be allowed transition;

e Indices z; are non-repetitive and take all levels
{0,1,...,r—1};
e Indices p; could be arbitrary levels, except those
that have already been eliminated: Vi < r,j <i=>
Di F 2.

In fact, we are not restricted to eliminating only the
last row in unitary matrix. For a given sequence for elim-
inated rows {rn }%=} (elimination from top rp_1 to bot-
tom ro), we just have to modify 3°¢ rule in the pattern.
On k*® step, where row r;, is eliminated, we should run
through indices z; that are non-repetitive and take all
levels {ro,71,---,TR-1}5

In total, the decomposition scheme consists of indices:

e rx, — the order of eliminated rows;
e 2; — the order of eliminated elements on k‘# step;
© Pei — pivot elements on k*" step.

Using defined rules, we could produce a decomposition
scheme for all arbitrary selection rules. The existence of
such decomposition is not obvious yet but will be proved
during the rest of the paper. Though indices for some se-
lection rules, e.g. for superconducting qudit and trapped-
ion qudit, are already obtained in the previous section
and depicted in Table I.

Table I. Decomposition scheme indices for several qudit
platforms: superconducting with 4 levels and trapped-ion
with 4 and 5 levels.

We note that these rules are not sufficient to get
a unique decomposition scheme. For example, in the
trapped-ion case we can eliminate first kK—1 elements in
any order and still get the row eliminated. Also, trapped-
ion qudit with 5 levels can utilize two different schemes
with different row orders. This degree of freedom can be
useful, since we are allowed to select operations accord-
ing to physical heuristics of levels and transitions of the
given qudit platform.

An arbitrary single-qudit system could be described as
a connected undirected graph G, where nodes N repre-
sent qudit levels and edges € represent allowed transi-
tions. To determine decomposition indices for a given
graph G, we propose the following algorithm:

e On the step & (runs from d—1 to 1), N has k+1
nodes/levels. We select levels that, if removed, do

(a) Select |r) candidates that can be removed without breaking
connectivity of the graph.

(b) Split the transition graph into sets {F;} using breadth-first
search. VI, |n) € Fy, — dist(|r) ,|n)) = 1.

(c) Add indices |z;) and |p;) into the decomposition scheme for
row |r).

(d) Degree of freedom is presented in this algorithm. Qudit
physical properties could be used to choose the best transition
sequence.

Figure 2. Algorithm that determines indices for qudit
decomposition scheme. It utilizes the graph structure of
selection rules and the breadth-first search algorithm.

not break connectivity of the graph. One of these
levels can be chosen as |r) to eliminate the row rz
of qudit unitary matrix (Figure 2a). Here we can
use physical heuristics to eliminate less stable levels
earlier;

e Each level |?) € G is assigned the shortest dis-
tance from the level |r,). This could be done us-
ing breadth-first search, which has time complexity
O(\M’| + |E|). We can split all levels into sets {Fy},
where F contains levels at distance | from |r,) (Fig-
ure 2b);

e Let L be the maximum distance from |r,) in the
G. Each level |zz;) € Fy, is connected by a transi-
tion to some element |pri) € Fy—1. We add these
indices into the decomposition scheme, then repeat
for all Fy in descending order of | (Figure 2c). There
could be several levels € Fy, connected to |zz;)
(Figure 2d). Using physical properties of a qudit,
we can select the least noisy transition.

e Continue the algorithm on the step k — 1 for the
ransition graph G’ = G/{|r.)} until k = 0.

Produced decomposition indices satisfy rules required for
correct row elimination:

e Indices zj; are taken from each {F)}/_,. These are
non-intersecting sets, so {|z;)} = G/{|rx)}, ie. all
elements are eliminated except diagonal one;

e Indices p;; do not intersect already eliminated ele-
ments, since they have distance > I.

Note that on each step transition graph remains con-
nected. This property is crucial for correct unitary de-
composition. If we have a graph with 2 or more discon-
nected components, then we can only obtain a non-zero
element per component. Each of these non-zero elements
could not be eliminated since they are not connected via
any R path.

The decomposition scheme is obtained once for a given
qudit platform. This static decomposition scheme can be
used to decompose any qudit unitary matrix using a pre-
defined pattern of transitions. However, for some sparse
matrices with zero non-diagonal elements, better opti-
mized decomposition may be performed using adaptive
decomposition (Figure 3).

Adaptive decomposition runs through the same step as
static decomposition for each unitary matrix. The differ-
ence is that a level is excluded from the graph during de-
composition if it corresponds to a zero element and does
not break graph connectivity. Also, the order of elimi-
nated rows is determined by matrix sparsity: rows with
fewer non-zero elements are eliminated earlier. To sum
up, adaptive decomposition is only valid for a given ma-
trix and contains the least amount of operations, whereas
static decomposition can be applied to an arbitrary ma-
trix.

The similar graph algorithm for the transition graph of
S6Rb* ions was mentioned in [83]. Though it describes
the general technique, we propose the algorithm that is
able to minimize physical execution error and reduce the
number of transitions for sparse unitaries.

VI. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING
DECOMPOSITION METHODS

To show the advantage of the developed algorithm,
we provide the comparison with other approaches that
provide the functionality of decomposing arbitrary qu-
dit unitary operations into the sequence of native pulses.
All of them provide Python packages that help execute
and compare results on a dxd Python matrix of the type
np.ndarray. We compare existing methods with our de-
veloped decompositions in Tables II and III.

The first approach is BQSKIT framework that pro-
vides a generic method for numerical synthesis of unitary
operations. It supports both single- or multi- qubit/qu-
dit unitary synthesis. There exist several methods in
BQSKIT that allow one to decompose qudit unitary op-
erations. First is QSearchPass method that constructs
the target unitary matrix numerically using the provided
gate set. We can obtain desired decomposition by declar-
ing custom parametric qudit gates, which correspond to
allowed transition R and phase shift P* operations. No-
tably, this method is not deterministic, so we run each ex-
periment 20 times and take the median value for decom-
position length. The second method is called QSweep-
Pass [88], which is not part of BQSKIT but relies on its
transpilation workflow. It uses numerical and analytical
results to construct qudit unitary operation in terms of
two-level operations. However, it does not support ar-
bitrary selection rules and only targets superconducting
transition topology.

The second approach is provided by MQT. Qudits [90]
framework for mixed-dimensional quantum computing,
which is part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit. It is pos-
sible to pass qudit transition graph with corresponding
weights into the LocQRPass method and obtain the se-
quence of allowed gates as decomposition. This frame-
work also supports adaptive gate transpilation mode via
he LocAdaPass method that can reduce the length of
he decomposition.

In the Table Ila, our method is called TAQR
(Transition-Aware QR decomposition) for static decom-
osition and TAQR Adaptive for adaptive decomposi-
ion. In our comparison we are targeting 3 types of selec-
ion rules given as an undirected graph for different qudit
latforms. First considered platform has line transition
graph (Table Ia), where only transitions on neighboring
levels are allowed. Superconducting qudits and photonic
circuits have this type of selection rules. We can extend
ine transition graph to any number of levels d. Sec-
ond platform is trapped-ion qudits. Overall, this type
of qudit can have any arbitrary transitions selected by
atomic physics rules. Though, particular trapped-ion de-
vices provide star transition graph (Table IIb) or bipartite
transition graph (Table IIc) of the size d. Star transition
graph is the special case of bipartite transition graph with
partition p=1. Bipartite transition graph with partition
p is the graph with two disjoint subsets with sizes p and
d—p, that is, every edge connects a vertex in the first
subset to one in the second. We use bipartite graph with
p=2 in our experiments.

Each method produces decomposition for each given
platform for on of the following single-qudit operations:

e State number increment/decrement gate xz" and
X71, which have the form as in Equation (4);

e Quantum Fourier Transform with the size d that is
denoted H, in Equation (7);

e Uniformly distributed (using Haar measure proce-
dure) unitary matrix Uy. Since the matrix is ran-
dom, we run each decomposition on 100 generated
matrices, then take median value for decomposition
length;

e Two-qubit matrix € U(4) that represents the action
on two qubits embedded into the qudit with d = 4.
Chosen gates are: RXX (7/2), RZZ (m/2), CZ, CX,
CH, SWAP.

To sum up, Transition-Aware QR decomposition per-
forms as good as any other qudit synthesis framework for
superconducting or photonic platforms. For the majority
of qudit unitary operations, it produces the decomposi-
tion with the same length in a reasonable time (refer
Table III in the Appendix for execution time compari-
son). Thus, it can become a drop-in replacement for the
qudit transpiler pass for single-qudit operations for this
type of platform.

Next, our method provides the shortest decomposi-
tion for trapped-ion platforms (with any arbitrary se-
lection rules). Our result outperforms the average nu-
merical decomposition using QSearch method that pro-
duces random decomposition on each invocation and
takes significantly greater execution time. It also outper-
forms MQT.Qudits compilation passes, which produce
more transitions and level-swaps for the same unitary.
For generic unitary, our method is guaranteed to pro-
duce d(d—1)/2 transitions, which is the theoretical up-
per bound (the number of lower non-diagonal elements
in unitary). And lastly, we have shown the potential
benefits of using either static or adaptive decomposition.
Static decomposition is computed once for each platform,
which reduces decomposition time during transpilation
process. On the other hand, adaptive decomposition con-
siders the sparsity of the given unitary matrix and pro-
duces a sequence with fewer transitions for several cases,
e.g. for X, operation.

Notably, while LocAdaPass produces shorter decom-
position for two-qubit gates embedded into the ququart,
it also permutes levels virtually. This fact makes sense
for whole qudit circuit optimization. Though, we should
permute rows virtually or using level-swaps gates to ob-
tain proper unitary. Potentially, our method can also
benefit from virtual level-swaps when it is a part of the
whole qudit circuit workflow.

VII. CONCLUSION

In this paper we have proposed the method that con-
verts d-level qudit unitary operation into the sequence of
the allowed transitions between qudit levels. It considers
arbitrary selection rules of the qudit system and produces
the optimal decomposition sequence in terms of transi-
tion amount. Moreover, we show that the decomposition
consists of no more than d(d—1)/2 transitions, which is
the theoretical upper bound for arbitrary unitary matrix
dxd. Decomposition could be done once for each qudit
of interest before the transpilation, then applied to any
unitary matrix to obtain parameters of transitions. This
is the essence of the static decomposition. On the other
hand, we have proposed the modification that utilizes the
sparsity of the matrix and the transition graph simul-
taneously. Such treatment could reduce the transition
amount even greater for some operations, such as levels
permutation xP". This modification is called adaptive
decomposition.

As we have shown, the crucial advantage of our ap-
proach is that it does not distinguish between qudit plat-
forms and produces similar optimal decomposition for
any transition graph. Most trapped-ion qudit platforms
could benefit from utilizing this approach due to complex
selection rules on operated levels.
