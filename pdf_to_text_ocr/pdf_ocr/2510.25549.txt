Ergotropy provides a fundamental measure of the extractable work from a quantum system and,
consequently, of the maximal useful energy, or charge, stored within it. Understanding how this
quantity can be manipulated and transformed efficiently is crucial for advancing quantum energy
management technologies. Here, we introduce and formalize the concepts of isoergotropic states and
ergotropy-preserving operations, which reorganize the internal structure of ergotropy while keeping
its total value unchanged. These ideas are illustrated for both discrete (two-level systems) and
continuous-variable systems (single-mode Gaussian states). In each case, we show how ergotropy-
preserving operations redistribute the respective coherent—incoherent and displacement-—squeezing
components. We further examine the thermodynamic exchanges accompanying ergotropy-preserving
operations, including variations in energy and entropy, and demonstrate that these transformations
can be dynamically implemented through standard beam-splitter-type interactions with an auxiliary
system. Finally, we discuss the practical implications of isoergotropic states and operations in

optimizing charging protocols and mitigating charge loss in open quantum batteries.

I. INTRODUCTION

Quantum thermal devices designed to perform specific
tasks hold significant promise for emerging energy-based
technologies. The ability to precisely design and control
the energetics across quantum systems has direct appli-
cations in a wide range of small-scale quantum devices.
Thus, the development of machines capable of harnessing
energy fluxes, performing work, and manipulating heat
transport, such as quantum heat engines, refrigerators,
thermal transistors, rectifiers and etc. [1-9], has been es-
tablished as one of the main motivations behind current
efforts in quantum thermodynamics.

Among such devices, quantum batteries (QBs) have
emerged as a promising and powerful paradigm for en-
ergy storage. In contrast to its classical counterparts,
QBs are capable of allocating a portion of their energy
within their quantum degrees of freedom [10-13]. Dur-

closed quantum systems and thus its work capacity [65].
This particular thermodynamic quantity is nonadditive
and fundamentally distinct from the internal energy, but
closely related to the role that free energy plays [66, 67],
since it implicitly incorporates the notion that energy ex-
traction requires an external cyclic Hamiltonian control.
It is worth mentioning that different notions and exten-
sions of ergotropy have been investigated in interacting
subsystems [68] and open quantum systems [69-71].
More recently, ergotropy has been shown to be dif-
ferently distributed within the multiple internal degrees
of freedom of QBs. Notably, it can be generally decom-
posed into two distinct contributions: an incoherent part,
associated with population inversion in the energy eigen-
basis, and a coherent part, arising from quantum coher-
ence [72-74]. While the former can be readily identified
as a purely classical contribution, the latter is genuinely
quantum, i.e., without any classical analogous. In the
context of QBs, coherence has been shown to enhance

tical perspective, considerable attention has been focused
on developing and optimizing charging protocols [44-48],
and providing strategies to ensure stable charge retention
in the presence of detrimental environmental effects [49-
64].

In this context, the charge of a QB is commonly iden-
tified by its ergotropy, the operational figure-of-merit

energy storage [72] and help mitigate ergotropy losses
in open quantum batteries [64]. More recently, the co-
herent ergotropy of a single spin has been experimen-
tally accessible in a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center plat-
form [75], elucidating its practical relevance for the cur-
rent state-of-the-art technologies. More importantly, the
internal configuration of charge is not unique, and one
can distribute it across all the accessible variables. In-
deed, the ergotropy stored in arbitrary Gaussian states,
for instance, was shown to be divided between indepen-
dent displacement and squeezing contributions [76].

Different degrees of freedom can store useful energy,
so distinct states may carry the same ergotropy (charge)
while differing in how that charge is internally encoded.
These encodings respond unevenly to control fields and
environmental noise, making states with equal charge op-
erationally non-equivalent. This raises a natural ques-
tion: which encoding is best for a given setting or ther-
modynamic task? Isoergotropic (ergotropy-preserving)
reorganization addresses this question. By redistributing
charge among internal degrees of freedom without chang-
ing its total amount, one can refine charging protocols,
enhance work extraction, propose novel charge stabiliza-
ion techniques, and prepare batteries that are more ro-
ust to specific noise mechanisms—all of which are cru-
cial for realistic, open-system implementations. From a
hhermodynamic perspective, such operations also enable
new cycles whose strokes reshuffle charge internally at
a fixed budget. Understanding—and exploiting—the in-
erplay between these internal compositions of ergotropy
is therefore both fundamental and practically important
or the design of energy-based quantum devices.

In this work, we formalize the set £ of ergotropically
equivalent quantum states and the class K of operations
hat preserve total ergotropy while redistributing its in-
ernal components. Our procedure covers both CPTP
channels and non-selective measurements. We then ana-
lyze the fundamental trade-offs among internal ergotropy
components for two representative battery models: dis-
crete two-level systems (TLSs) and continuous variable
CV) single-mode Gaussian states. On the implementa-
ion side, we show that these ergotropy-preserving oper-
ations can be realized dynamically with standard beam-
splitter interactions to an auxiliary system, available
in current platforms. Finally, we illustrate how isoer-
gotropic states and operations aid practice: they en-
able the refinement of charging protocols and mitigate
charge loss by exploiting an ergotropic counterpart of the
Mpemba effect.

The remainder of this article is structured as follows.
In Sec. II we recall the definition of ergotropy and intro-
duce isoergotropic states and ergotropy-preserving oper-
ations. In Secs. III and IV, we apply these ideas to
quantum batteries built from discrete and continuous-
variable cells, modeled by two-level systems and single-
mode Gaussian states, respectively. Each section is self-
contained: we identify the corresponding isoergotropic
states, specify the ergotropy-preserving operations, and
describe how to reorganize ergotropy dynamically within
the internal degrees of freedom using a standard beam-
splitter coupling. In Sec. V, we illustrate how the for-
malism developed here applies to relevant scenarios for
quantum batteries, including charging and discharging
protocols. Finally, Sec. VI summarizes the main conclu-
sions and outlines directions for future work.

II. ERGOTROPY AND ISOERGOTROPIC
OPERATIONS

Let us assume a d-dimensional quantum system de-
scribed by a density matrix p = be py\J) (| € £ and
Hamiltonian H = ye E,,\E,)(E;|. As a quantum bat-
tery, its charge is commonly characterized by the maxi-
mum extractable energy through a unitary cyclic Hamil-
tonian control. This quantity, also known as ergotropy,

where pp = yi pi|E;)(E;| is the passive state relative to

and Ey < Ey < --: < Eg were assumed. Note that
Eq. (1) can equivalently be obtained by identifying the
unitary V that reorders the populations p; so as to min-
imize the system’s energy, p > pp = Vpvt. In general,
the total ergotropy of a system may be distributed among
distinct internal degrees of freedom. Consequently, dif-
ferent states can possess identical ergotropy—hence the
same stored charge—while exhibiting distinct internal
configurations. Formally, we introduce the following def-
inition:

Definition 1. Given an active state 6 with ergotropy
R= Ri], the set of isoergotropic (iso-R) states relative
to @ is defined as L:= {fp € L|R[A] = R}.

Figure 1 illustrates such states for (a) a two-level sys-
tem and (b) a single-mode Gaussian state [77]. In panel
(a), the colored surfaces on the Bloch sphere, and in panel
(b), the colored sheets in the (|y:|?,|€|, NV) space, collect
states with the same total ergotropy but different inter-
nal compositions of charge. The inset Wigner functions
W (a) illustrate distinct Gaussian states with equal total
charge and thermal occupation N but different displace-
ment js and squeezing €. Transformations connecting
states within a given isoergotropic surface correspond to
ergotropy-preserving operations, which redistribute the
internal composition of stored work while keeping its to-
tal value invariant. Unitaries that commute with the
Hamiltonian, [U, H] = 0 (e.g., free evolution), constitute
trivial instances of such operations, leaving the internal
configuration unchanged. We therefore define:

Definition 2. Given a state 6 € L, iso-R operations are
CPTP (measurements) maps satisfying K:£+> L£.

These operations provide the “free transformations" in
a prospective resource theory of ergotropy at a fixed bud-
get. The resource corresponds to the configuration of
stored work within a given level set £, while the iso-R
maps K represent the admissible reshufflings that pre-
serve the total ergotropy. Below, we instantiate this for
discrete (TLS) and continuous-variable Gaussian batter-
les.

Ill. TWO-LEVEL SYSTEMS

We begin with a TLS described by the Hamilto-
nian H = wle)(e| and by the density operator p =
(1p) la)(al + ple)(el + ¢ (e/fla)(el + hc.) /2, where
h.c. denotes the Hermitian conjugate, 0 € [0,47] and
C= Ly; lelAli)|, with C2 € [0,4p(1 — p)], is the 1,
norm of coherence in the energy eigenbasis [78].

In general, Eq. (1) for ergotropy can be split into a
contribution due to population inversion and a contri-
bution due to coherences (both defined in the Hamil-
tonian eigenbasis). Define the incoherent state Baie =
Tp (ExlAlEr) |ExXEx| and set R(A] = Rlpaiog)
RHA] = Rip] — Ri [A]. Then the ergotropy is fully
parameterized by (p,C): R(p,C) = Ri*°(p) + R°"(p,C),
with [64, 72-74]

R®¢(p) = w(2p — 1) [1 - @(1/2 —p)], (2)

and
ReM(p.C) =F (b— VR —C), (3)

where O() is the Heaviside step function (O(”) = 1 for
x > 0, O(x) = 0 otherwise), u[A] = Tr[f?] is the purity,
and w := \/2u[A] — 1. Both components are independent
of the phase 0; variations of 0 thus generate a trivial
family of isoergotropic states. Moreover, R°°(p,C) = 0
for incoherent states (C = 0), while R™°(p) is nonzero iff
p > 1/2 (the active regime).
A. Isoergotropic states

Given an active incoherent state 65 = (1 —p) |g)(g| 4
ple)(e| with p €]1/2, 1] with ergotropy Rp = R(p,0) =
R'™<(p), the corresponding isoergotropic set is

Li = {hp € £| Ripp(p, 9)] = Ro} (4)

A convenient parametrization of the states in Ly is

so gv ( l-p  Cplpe!®/2 :
7009) = ( oot» . Pp ) ©)

where C}(p) = 8(p—p) Pz and Ps < p < p, with Ps = 2p—
1 and @ € [0,47]. As extreme states, one has the mixed
reference state 05 (by construction) for p = p and its rel-
ative isoergotropic pure state fp(P5,0) = |Vp,9) (Yp,6| for
p= Pp, with |Upo) = 20 — Bly) + e-8/2, 2p Tle).
Thus, for each fixed p, the total ergotropy is redistributed
between the incoherent and coherent parts, such that

Rp _ R™(p) Ae R°°(p, Cp), (6)

while remaining constant. Figure 2 (a) shows the Bloch
sphere representation, with s, = Tr[éxAp(p)] with k =
x,y,z, and the isoergotropic surfaces generated by dif-
ferent values of p. For each p, the incoherent states dp
lies on the s, axis, while the isoergotropic pure state
Pp(P5,9) lies on the surface of the sphere. Figure 2 (b)
displays the ergotropy profile on the p — C? surface; the
colored curves correspond to the same isoergotropic sets
as in (a), and the black curve at p = Py; marks the pure
states. Finally, Fig. 2 (c) depicts how the internal er-
gotropy splits into coherent and incoherent components
along two representative paths: (Top) Cé(p) and (Bot-
tom) Py.

Thermodynamics

Having identified the isoergotropic set Lp, we now ex-
amine how key thermodynamic quantities vary along it.
In this sense, note that, despite having the same er-
gotropy, different iso-R states necessarily contain differ-
ent internal energies, unambiguously identified as [79]

(H) = Tr[HAp(p, 8)] = wp. (7)

So, any iso-R transformation pp(p,0) > pp(p',’) in-
duces the following energetic change

AU = A(A) = w(p' — p). (8)

If the Hamiltonian is fixed (no explicit time dependence),
no work is performed W = Tr[p AH] = 0 [80, 81], and
the first law of thermodynamics AU = Q+W reduces to

Q = w(p' —p). (9)

Therefore, moving between the iso-R states requires the
supply or release of heat. Notice that, for any p, states

'S 0.75)

0.5!

P (H)/w

FIG. 3: (a) Ratio R/(H) = (2p—1)/p on the (p, p)-plane.
For each p, the ratio decreases monotonically with p from
1 at the pure point p = Py to (2p—1)/p at the incoherent
point p = p. (b) Energy-entropy diagram on Lp: (Hf) =
wp and S,v(p) = H2(2p—p) increase monotonically with
p. Arrows indicate heat Q = w(p’ — p) absorbed (right,
red) or released (left, blue) when moving along £5. Black
dashed: p = P5 (pure, Syv = 0); blue solid: p = p
(incoherent, Sy. = H2(p)).

closer to the center of the Bloch sphere are more ener-
getic, i.e., p closer to p and the z-axis. Given the in-
variance of ergotropy, this also implies the proportion of
energy stored as charge decreases, that is, R/(H) < 1 for
p < Py. To illustrate this, Fig. 3 (a) shows the ratio be-
tween charge and internal energy for all values of p and
p. Additionally, Fig. 3 (b) depicts the internal energy
vs. entropy diagram for all isoergotropic states. The von
Neumann entropy is written as

Sun [Op(p, 8)] = Ha(2p — p), (10)

with H2(x) = —xIna—(1—2) In (1 — 2) being the binary
entropy function, varies across the isoergotropic surfaces.
The blue lines highlight the mixed states along the z-axis
with p = p, while the black dashed lines show the re-
gion with pure states p = Py at the surface of the Bloch
sphere, with S,,[/p(Pp, 9)] = 0. Consequently, there are
no nontrivial operations that simultaneously conserve er-
gotropy and are isentropic or energy-preserving: along
Lp, for fixed H, nontrivial iso-R transformations nec-
essarily involve heat exchange and entropy change; they
are not implementable by system-only unitaries, but arise
naturally as thermal operations or as reduced dynamics
of an energy-conserving global unitary.

B. Ergotropy preserving operations

It is clear that the tradeoff between coherent and inco-
herent components of ergotropy within different states of
Ly implies that iso-R operations are, in general, neither
incoherent nor purity-preserving (and, as noted above,
FIG. 4: Isoergotropic operations. The continuous and
dashed lines indicate two distinct ergotropy-preserving
trajectories along £Lo.7 from the black to the red points.

not entropy-preserving either). In fact, incoherent op-
erations preserve only the incoherent part of ergotropy.
Given a state fp(p,@) € Lp, we call iso-R operations the
CPTP maps (or measurement instruments) that satisfy

a SWAP gate. To illustrate iso-R operations, Fig. 4
shows two distinct ergotropy-preserving trajectories
along £o.7 generated from Eq. (12). The black (red) dots
mark the initial (final) states. By choosing the parame-
ters appropriately, any path on the Bloch sphere within
£o.7 can be implemented.

1. Iso-R realization via POVM

Iso-R operations can also be realized through selec-
tive measurements (POVM elements). A single selective
measurement is sufficient to realize an isoergotropic op-
eration that maps an incoherent two-level system active
state to any other state within the same isoergotropic
family. Indeed, consider the incoherent active state

= (1—p)|9) (gl +Ple) Cel, (16)

and its corresponding isoergotropic family Lp. When the
desired target is a pure member of Lp, a rank-one selec-
tive measurement suffices. Let the single measurement
operator be

M = |dout) (din, (17)

which, acting on 6p, yields the (unnormalized) post-
measurement state

M6pM" = (in| Op |din) |Gout) (Gout - 18)
After renormalization, the output is pure, such that
B' = |dout) (bout - 19)

To remain within £5, the output state |¢o,,) must be
the normalized eigenvector of the target isoergotropic el-
ement,

The success probability of this transformation is

Hence, the optimal Kraus operator reads

and the maximal success probability follows as
Pace (P) = P- (23)

For a general mixed target in £5, a rank-one operator
is no longer sufficient, as it always yields a pure out-
put. Nevertheless, a single selective measurement with a
higher-rank Kraus operator can achieve the transforma-
tion in one step. Specifically, consider the ansatz

By construction,

and the normalized post-measurement state (upon the
success outcome) is precisely the mixed isoergotropic el-
ement fp(p’, 6’).

Finally, if one is allowed to reset the input to Op after

identical with per-trial success probability qmax- In that
operational setting the cumulative success probability af-
ter N attempts is the geometric (Bernoulli) form

PLN) =1- (1 = dmax)™, (31)

which tends to unity as N — oo. Thus, a single selec-
tive measurement suffices to generate any state—pure or
mixed—within the isoergotropic family Lp starting from
the incoherent active state 6p.

C. Dynamic ergotropy conversion

We now show how iso-R operations can be engineered
autonomously by coupling a quantum battery (B) to
an auxiliary system (A). Consider two TLS with to-

tal Hamiltonian H = Hp + Ha + Vaps where Hy, B=
wa,B |e)(e|a,p and
Vap = in(e2 @o4 — 6? 64), (32)

with coupling strength 7. For simplicity we take resonant
TLSs, wa = wg =w. If the initial local states are pp (0)

FIG. 5: Top: Bloch sphere representation of the (a) bat-
tery and (b) auxiliary TLS dynamics induced by U(t), as-
suming 65(0) = pp(Pp,0) and pa(0) = pp(P, ¢) (colored
dots) as initial states, and w = 7 = 1. The isoergotropic
curves £5 for different values of p are represented. Bot-

Notice that Eq. (33) has the same swap block structure as
Eq. (15). Prepare both systems on the same isoergotropic
curve Ly with pg(0) = pp(P5,9) and pa(0) = pp(p, 6).
Then the battery state at time t reads

Pa(t) = pp(pa(t), 8 + 2wt) € Lp, (34)
where

Figure 5(a,b) shows the corresponding trajectories on the
Bloch sphere for the battery and the auxiliary (for several
pand w =17=1). The battery remains on the same iso-
ergotropic surface, whereas the auxiliary generally does
not. Panels (c,d) display the dynamics of total ergotropy
and its coherent/incoherent components for both sub-
systems: the auxiliary ergotropy oscillates with period
nT = 1, while the battery cyclically converts coherent
ergotropy into incoherent ergotropy and back.

FIG. 6: (a) Charge and (b) von Neumann entropy dy-
namics induced by U(t) for p = 0.8. The entropy and
ergotropies of the full system (computed without the in-

teraction, i.e, H4 + Hg) and the battery are invarian'
during the time-evolution. The ergotropy of the auxil-
iary system oscillation is accompanied by the conversion
of coherent ergotropy to incoherent. Such oscillation is
also observed by the local entropies Sj and mutual in-
formation Z.

Although the total ergotropy of the composite is con-
served because [(/(t), H] = 0, the local decrease of auxil-
iary ergotropy quantifies the internal energetic cost of the
conversion on the battery. In realistic settings, the inter-
action strength 7 can be modulated in time to tailor this
conversion. If only local ergotropy is available, the full
energetic cost comprises both the auxiliary’s ergotropy
consumption and the control required to modulate the
interaction. If global access to the composite ergotropy
is available, only the external control cost remains rele-
vant.

Figure 6 further reports (a) ergotropy and (b) the
von Neumann entropies $y and the mutual information
TL = Syn [Pp|+Sun[pal—Svn [Pea] during the interaction
for p = 0.8. The auxiliary’s ergotropy oscillations are in
resonance with changes in local entropies. The growth of
mutual information signals the build-up of correlations,
accompanying a decrease (increase) of the battery’s co-
herent ergotropy (the auxiliary’s ergotropy).

D. Extension

Naturally, one can extend the iso-R analysis to
multi-cell batteries composed of n TLSs and identify
suitable ergotropy—preserving operations implemented
by local or global transformations. As a simple and rel-
evant two-cell example, consider the family of X-states
with Hamiltonian H = w |e) (el; @ 12 + 11 @w |e) (el2 and

total ergotropy satisfies R(q) = R(1 — q) for all gq; the

state with 0 < q < 0.3 has a correlated isoergotropic

(36)

Equation (36) can be obtained as the output of an opti-

mal unitary applied to two Gibbs states that maximizes
quantum correlations [85]—including entanglement and
discord [84]—and local uncertainty. For this X-family,
the concurrence is

C(q) = max{0, 2q° —q- 201-4) Va - a}. (37)

While entanglement vanishes at a finite critical tempera-
ture [84, 86, 87], other quantum signatures decay gradu-
ally with temperature [84, 85]. The ergotropy within the
bipartition is

R(q) =w|L-2q, — R'*(q) =w|(q—2)(G— 9), (38)

hence R(q) = R(1 —q) for all g. Thus, fx(q) and
px (1 — q) are isoergotropic, even though their entangle-
ment may differ significantly [64]. Figure 7 (top) high-
lights the symmetric ergotropy profile and the split be-
tween coherent and incoherent contributions; Fig. 7 (bot-

den death. In particular, every uncorrelated state with

and the maximally entangled px(1): both have the same
ergotropy, with Ri"°(1) = R°(1) = w/2. Moreover, one
finds that the internal energy is constant for all q while
1

the von Neumann entropy is symmetric about q = 5

(with a maximum at g = 4): (H) = Tr[Héx(q)] =
and S,n(q) = Syn(1—q). Consequently, the fraction
of energy stored as charge decreases near gq = 1/2 and
for the isoergotropic transformation q +» 1 — q one has
AU = AS,n =0 and W = -@Q.

An explicit iso-R operation connecting the partners
can be written as

K [ax (q)] = VTraw [8 (Ox(@) © Faux) O']V", (39)

where U is the 4 x 4 SWAP, the auxiliary state is Taux =
7 ® Fy with te = (1 —q)|9)(gle + ale) (eles and V = d2d4

6a = |+) (oal + lge) (gel + leg} (eal + Id-} (eel,

and |¢4) = (|gg) + |ee))/V2. This construction realizes
the isoergotropic mapping g +> 1 — q by a thermal auxil-
iary system plus a global unitary and a fixed postprocess-
ing unitary V. Note that the mapping g++ 1 — q cannot
be implemented deterministically by local operations and
classical communications (LOCC) [88] for q € (0,1): for
q< 3 it generally increases entanglement (e.g., the con-
currence of x(q) is smaller than that of x (1—q)), which
is forbidden under LOCC; accordingly, our construction
employs a thermal ancilla and a global unitary.

In this sense, it is natural to consider isoergotropic
transformations according to the LOCC paradigm for
work extraction in correlated systems similar to the
framework proposed in Ref. [89], where local heat en-
gines can act on each subsystem and classical communi-
cation is allowed. In our setting, one may similarly ask
whether a transformation that is non—isoergotropic when
constrained locally can nevertheless become globally iso-
ergotropic—or at least less non—isoergotropic—once clas-
sical coordination and suitable ancillas are considered.

This motivates defining an LOCC-iso-R class of oper-
ations that preserve the total ergotropy of the compos-
ite while acting locally, and introducing an “ergotropy
deficit” to quantify the difference between globally pre-
served ergotropy and what is retained by purely lo-
cal means. A systematic characterization of the mini-
mal nonlocal resources (shared randomness, classical vs.
quantum communication, ancilla temperature) required
to uplift locally non-isoergotropic processes to globally
isoergotropic ones is an open direction for our future
work.

From a thermodynamic perspective, the coupling to
the auxiliary implements a heat exchange Q = w(2q—1),
while the subsequent unitary Vv performs coherent work
W = —Q, so that the net energy change vanishes: AU =
Q+W = 0. Moreover, the initial and final von Neu-
mann entropies coincide, S,v[6x(q)] = Sun [ax(1 —4)],
so the transformation q ++ 1 — q is entropy-preserving
overall. It is worth mentioning that in the SWAP step,
the heat exchanged between the composite system and
the auxiliary does not go to the correlations inside the
composite system since we have no interaction within
them: (H) = (H,) + (Hz). This heat is accounted for
entirely by changes in the local energies.

As for the local ergotropies, the bipartite state in
Eq. (36), the reduced states px(q) = Trg[Ax(q)] (k = 1, 2;
k = 2,1) are diagonal with p;(q) = 1 — 3q +¢q and

p2(q) = 3q- being the excited-state populations of the
subsystems 1, 2 respectively. Figure 8 plots Ry (black),
Re (orange), and R (green): for q < } only cell 2 carries
charge; for gq > 3 only cell 1 does. The total ergotropy
R(q) = wll — 2q| > Ri(q) + Ro(q), the excess being
due to correlations/coherences. Under the isoergotropic
mapping q +> 1 —4q, each cell exchanges heat equal to its
energy change (no local work), giving

Qi=w (« - 7) > Q2=-Q1. (41)

Hence, for g > $ cell 1 absorbs heat (Q > 0) while cell
2 releases heat (Q2 < 0); the roles reverse for q < 4
The global energy is constant and the total ergotropy is
preserved.

IV. BOSONIC GAUSSIAN STATES

Consider a single-mode bosonic field of frequency w
with Hamiltonian H = w(a@'a+4), where a and at satisfy
[a,4*] = 1. Assume the system is in a Gaussian state of
the form

p= D(u) S() #(N) $1) DV(u), (42)
where 7(N) is a thermal state with occupation N =
(e® —1)-1, Diu) = exp(uat — a) is the displace-
ment operator, and $(€) = exp[5(€a!? — €*4?)] is the
squeezing operator, with complex parameters 4. = \ulet®

and € = |€|e’®. Any single-mode Gaussian state admits
the decomposition in Eq. (42) [90]. Equivalently, Gaus-
sian states are fully characterized by first and second mo-
ments: the mean vector d = ((a), (@t))? = (,u*)? and
the covariance matrix © = (N + 4) F(€,¢), with

FE.9)= (Selden cosh(2|é\) ) (3)

A convenient phase-space representation is given by the
Wigner function, defined as

W(a) = —~= exp[—-}(a-d)io'(a—d)], (44
(a) = gy oPl-Hla- Mea a], (4s
with a = (a,a*) and || = det ©. Both displacement
and squeezing contribute independently to the total er-
gotropy, so the stored charge can be parameterized by
(H,€,.N) as R(,€,N) = R4(n) + REN), with [72, 76]

Note that N enters only the squeezing contribution.
Moreover, Eq. (45) is independent of the phases 6 and
@, which provides a trivial class of iso-R states.

A. Isoergotropic states

Given an active Gaussian state of the form 6, =
D(q)#(0)Dt(f@), with ergotropy Ra = R(ji,0,0)

R4(ji), the set of isoergotropic Gaussian states relative
to 0g is written as

Lyne = {Pp € £| R[Pa(usé,N)] = Ra}, (46)
for 0 < |u| < |p|, |€| > 0 and N > 0. These states can
be written as pa(j.€,N) = D(w)S()*(N)S*(©)D"(n),
where pp = \/fz(€, Nye with

fyl&.N) = nl? = (+5) foosn(@le)— 1], (47)

and (€, N) satisfying fp(€,N) > 0. Figure 9 shows the
ergotropy profile in terms of parameters (u,€,N). In
(a), is highlighted the isoergotropic surfaces £1, £2,5 and
L5. Figure 9 (b) shows the surface N = 1/2. The dashed
lines indicate the surfaces shown in (a). The bottom part
of Fig. 9 (c) presents the internal ergotropy distribution
along the iso-ergotropic curve represented by f5(€,1/2).
The black vertical lines highlight the points where (i)
R® = 0, (ii) R? = R* and (iii) R? = 0. The Wigner
function W(q) for each of these cases is presented in the
plots at the top.

Thermodynamics

As in the TLS case, isoergotropic states on the same
level set can differ in their thermodynamic properties.
For single-mode Gaussian states with Hamiltonian H =
w(ata+ 4), the internal energy reads

(H) = Tr[A pp(u,€,N)]

Ri(E,N)+R4()+w(N + 4).
Along an iso-R manifold L)q)2 the total ergotropy Ra =
R> +R is fixed, so

(H) =Rp+w(N +3),

which is independent of the squeezing parameter €. Con-
sequently, for fixed |ji|? the ratio of charge to energy de-
pends only on the thermal component:

Be Ra
(H) Ra tw(N +3)’

Figure 10(a) shows this behavior on £5 as a function of
N and €; the green dashed curve marks the zero set of
fal€,N). We quantify mixedness by the Rényi-2 entropy
So(p) = (1 — 2)~1 In Tr[p? [91], for which

Sa{aa(u,€,N)] =In(1+2N), (49)

ie., Sy depends only on N and is invariant under
displacement and squeezing. Figure 10(b) plots the
((H), So, Rj) diagram for different N and ji; black
(blue) curves correspond to N = 0 (N = 1), and
the red line highlights fj = 0 (no ergotropy: all en-
ergy/entropy is thermal). Differentiating Eq. (48) and
using dR° + dR* = 0 on Lijaj2 yields

d(H) =wdN.

With Hf fixed (no explicit time dependence) the first law
gives W = 0 and therefore

Q=AU =wAN.

Hence, reshuffling ergotropy between displacement and
squeezing at fixed N is thermodynamically neutral on
he subsystem:

dN =0 Q=0, d;,=0, dRyz =0:

Only changes in the thermal occupancy N carry heat
Q =wdN) and entropy (dS_ = 2dN/(1+2N) under Eq.
49)). Figure 10(c) shows fixed-N lines on £5; the yellow
curve is an isothermal trajectory (N = 0.5). Moving
rom the black to the red point along this line leaves (H),
So, and R, unchanged, while the internal composition

RS & R4 is reconfigured, as illustrated in Fig. 10(d).

B. Ergotropy-preserving operations

Restricting to Gaussian states, we likewise restrict
to Gaussian iso-R operations. Given an initial state
Pa(u,§,N), an iso-R Gaussian map K: Lyjaj2 > Ljqj2 pro-
duces

ba(ws§'N’) = K[éa(H.€,N)I, (50)

with total ergotropy Rg unchanged. Gaussian channels
are fully specified by their action on the first moments d

and the optimal vector is
IGopt) = U(n, &) [0) 64)
so that the optimal Kraus reads
Mops = |i) (opel - 65)

Analogously to the qubit case, this shows that selective
measurements can be employed in Gaussian systems to
transform one state into another while preserving the er-

gotropy.

C. Dynamic ergotropy conversion

Similarly to the TLS case, isoergotropic operations can
be performed dynamically in a Gaussian quantum bat-
tery (B) by coupling it to an auxiliary system (A). As-
sume two resonant bosonic modes with total Hamilto-
nian H = Hp + Ha +Vap, where Hp = w(b'b + 1/2),

hat, during the dynamics, both systems change within
Ls. While both local ergotropies are constant, the dis-
lacement and squeezing components oscillate with pe-
riod nT = x. The former changes due to x(t), while
he latter is due to Nx(t). Moreover, Fig. 12 (e) illus-
rates the Wigner function at different instants of time,
or 0g = 0, 6g = 7, andw =7 =1. For t = 0, most
of the battery’s charge is stored in the squeezing com-
onent. In t = 7/4, one observes R4, = R%;, until the
ergotropy is transferred to the displacement component.
The auxiliary system follows the opposite behavior. No-
ice that such a process has no internal cost of ergotropy,
ie., both the total and local charges are invariant, as
shown by Fig. 13 (a). Thus, the only cost to realize such
internal reorganization is due to the interaction term.
To evaluate how the correlations change, Fig. 13 (b) de-
picts how the Rényi-2 entropies and mutual information
change during the dynamics.

Vv. APPLICATIONS

To highlight the potential significance of understanding
the set of isoergotropic states, in the following, we will
examine two relevant scenarios for quantum batteries:
charging and discharging.

A. Charging

Charging a quantum battery—i.e., increasing its er-
gotropy—amounts to transforming a passive state into
an active one. In the simplest setting this can be done by
coupling the storage to a semi-classical charger for a fixed
duration JT. This direct charging protocol [26] is mod-
eled by a time-dependent Hamiltonian H(t) = Hp+V(t),
with Hg the battery Hamiltonian and V(t) the charging
drive, switched on only for 0 < ¢ < T (V(t) = 0 oth-
erwise). The evolution is unitary, A(t) = —i[H(t), A(t)],

FIG. 14: Isoergotropic surfaces and optimal-power charg-
ing. Starting from passive (uncharged) states, the cone
marks all states reachable at maximal average power in
the direct protocol; it corresponds to the fixed polar angle

trate representative charging trajectories. The circular
arcs are the intersections between the cone and the iso-R
surfaces Lp; points on an intersection are optimal states

and supplies both energy (Hg) and ergotropy R to the
battery. A natural performance goal is to maximize the
average charging power under realistic constraints. We
define

(W) = D{He (A(T) — A(0))], (76)

and assume a bounded driving strength, ||H(t)|| <
é. For a single TLS with Hg = |e)(e| and Bloch
representation p(t) = (i + s(t) - o)/2, s(t) =
s(sin Q; COS Y;, SiN Qy SiN Yz, COS ai)’, the optimal proto-
col with respect to the power under the norm bound
is [33]

a é. x é es

H(t) = — 9 SiN Gt Ox + 5 COS Ht Fy, (77)
which drives

Yt = Po, a4 = a9 + et.

Starting from a passive (uncharged) state on the north
pole, ag = 0 and s(0) = so(0,0,1)7 with so € [0,1], the
average power evaluates to (P) = so{1 — cos(eT)] /2T.
Maximizing (P) over T yields

cos(eT) + eT sin(eT) = 1, (78)

whose solution gives a7 = eT ~ 0.747. Thus the set of
active states attainable with optimal power forms a cone
on the Bloch sphere,

as indicated by the colored dots (initial states) and
dashed lines (driven trajectories) in Fig. 14.

B. Open QB and discharging

External dissipation and decoherence degrade the per-
formance of quantum devices in general [93-97]. Miti-
gating ergotropy leakage is therefore essential for realis-
tic quantum batteries [63, 64]. The ability to reshuffle
the internal composition of ergotropy, developed above,
enables the preparation of states that are more robust
against environmental noise. To illustrate this, we cou-
ple the battery weakly to a thermal reservoir at inverse
temperature §. The local dynamics of a TLS and of a
single-mode Gaussian state (GS) are described by the
GKLS master equation (h = kg = 1) [98]:

TLS: p= —ifff, A] + 1(1 — YD, [64] + 99D, [6],
GS: p iH, 0 + y(1+n)D,[a} 4 nD, [a"),

(81)

where 7 is the decay rate, i = (e®”+1)~1 is the fermionic
(bosonic) occupation number for the TLS (GS), and
D,|[6] = 6pot — {6t6, p}/2. Equation (81) relaxes each
system to the Gibbs state at temperature 1/3, discharg-
ing the battery. Crucially, the coherent and incoherent
(displacement and squeezing) parts of ergotropy decay
differently, and the observed discharge reflects their in-
terplay.

Regarding the TLS system at time t the state
has the form a(t) = (1—ps)lg)(gl + pele)(el 4

Ce (cis lg)(el + he.) /2, with populations and coherence

evolving independently as p, = (pp —n)e~% + 7 and
C2 = Cie". Thus po = m and Cx = 0. The
(in)coherent components of the ergotropy can be com-
puted using Eqs. (2) and (3). Interestingly, as ob-
served by a previous work [64], despite the monotoni-
cally decreasing behavior of the population and coher-
ence, non-intuitive ergotropy dynamics can appear due
to coherence, i.e., depending on the initial conditions,
the coherent ergotropy becomes non-monotonic in time.
More specifically, the maximum of R°°! is reached for
p = 1/2, thus if po > 1/2, one observes a first in-
crease of the coherent ergotropy until p;,,. = 1/2 be-
fore asymptotically approaching zero, where Tg *=
yotin [(r0 —n) (1/2 —n)~") is the time required for the
incoherent state become passive. Figures 15(a)—(c) show,
or all initial states on Lo.g, that the total and incoher-
ent charges decay monotonically, while the coherent part
can exhibit a transient increase. Panel 15(a) marks the
half-life Ty 2 defined by R(T1/2) = R(0)/2. States with
arger initial coherence have longer T;/2 despite sharing
he same initial charge. Figure 15(d) depicting the half-
ife time in terms of p and Py < p < p confirms this trend
across different iso-R surfaces: within a given Lp, coher-
ent (near-pure) states on the Bloch-sphere surface are the
most resilient to environment-induced dissipation.
As for the GS states, since the dissipators in Eq. (81)
are linear in @ and a‘, Gaussianity is preserved. The
ergotropy at time t is given by Eg. (45) with time-
dependent parameters (jt, €, N;) evolving as [76]

with A, = 2(N —n)e~% + (n + 1/2). Figures 15(e)—(g)
display the decay of charge for different initial points on
Ls with N = 0.5: both the squeezing and displacement
contributions decrease monotonically, but the half-life is
shorter for larger initial |€|. This “hotter empties faster”
behavior is the ergotropic analogue of the Mpemba ef-
fect [76]. Panel 15(h) shows Tj, versus |€| for several NV,
confirming the trend across £5.

In summary, consistent with Refs. [64, 76], tailoring
the internal composition of ergotropy—either at prepa-
ration (charging) or via iso-R operations—yields states

that retain charge longer under open-system dynamics,
providing a practical advantage for quantum batteries in
realistic noisy environments.

VI. DISCUSSION

A central challenge in the study of quantum batter-
ies (QBs) lies not only in maximizing their stored en-
ergy but also in understanding how this charge is in-
ternally structured and can be effectively manipulated.
While ergotropy R provides a fundamental measure of
the extractable work from a quantum state, recent in-
sights show that this quantity can be distributed among
distinct internal components, classical and quantum de-
grees of freedom. This internal composition plays a cru-
cial role in determining how the stored charge can be
accessed, transformed, or preserved during realistic op-
erations, including efficient charging and work extraction.

In this broader context, we introduced and investi-
gated the set £ of isoergotropic states, defined as states
possessing the same total ergotropy but different inter-
nal configurations of ergotropy. Although such states are
equivalent in terms of their stored charge, they may ex-
hibit markedly distinct physical properties, including in-
ternal energy, purity, and entropy. We further explored
the class K of quantum operations—comprising com-
pletely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) maps and se-
lective measurements that act within £, preserving total
ergotropy while redistributing its internal components.
The thermodynamics involved during such processes is
also verified, including heat transfer and the possibility
of isentropic and internal energy-conserving transforma-
tions. As relevant examples, these concepts are illus-
trated and applied with both discrete and continuous-
variable quantum batteries, respectively represented by
two-level systems and Gaussian states. While in the for-
mer, the charge is stored within the coherent and in-
coherent components, in the latter, it is independently
distributed along the displacement and squeezing ones.

We also demonstrated that dynamical conversion be-
tween the internal components of ergotropy can be
achieved by coupling the quantum battery to an auxil-
iary system. In particular, Eqs. (32) and (66), describing
the interactions for the TLS and Gaussian cases, share
the structure of a beam-splitter-type coupling. Such in-
teractions enable coherent energy exchange while con-
serving the total number of excitations in the compos-
ite system. These couplings allow the autonomous re-
configuration of ergotropy and the simultaneous realiza-
tion of isoergotropic transformations within the target
systems. Based on the results reported in [75],
ticipate that these processes could be exploited to se-
lectively assess and extract specific components of the
stored charge. Beam-splitter-type interactions are stan-
dard tools in quantum optics and are widely used across
various quantum technologies [99-101]. Moreover, such
couplings can be readily engineered in both optical and

we an-

superconducting platforms [102-104]. Therefore, isoer-
gotropic operations can be realistically implemented in
quantum batteries using current state-of-the-art tech-
nologies.

To this end, we also explored the practical implica-
tions of iso-R states and operations in relevant scenar-
ios. Considering a direct charging protocol for a TLS,
we characterized the set of states that achieve optimal
charging power and identify the corresponding optimal
isoergotropic states within each Lp, as illustrated by the
intersections in Fig. 14. In this way, one can either tune
the initial discharged state fo to reach a desired iso-R
surface or determine the optimal charged state attainable
from a given fo. Similar analyses can be performed for
other optimization criteria and charging strategies. Fur-
thermore, we investigated the robustness of different iso
ergotropic states under environmental noise. By accoun
ing for the distinct dynamical behavior of the ergotropic
components, one can mitigate dissipative charge loss in
open quantum batteries—either by charging into suitable
isoergotropic states or by dynamically reshuffling the er-
gotropy between components. As shown in Fig. 15(a),
isoergotropic states with coherence exhibit longer half-
life times T)/2, thus decaying more slowly. A similar
advantage is observed in Fig. 15(b), where maximizing
the ergotropy stored in the displacement component en-
hances robustness against dissipation.

The formalism and analyses developed here can be sys-
tematically extended to arbitrary quantum battery archi-
tectures. Future work should aim to identify additional
applications and explicitly incorporate iso-R operations
into practical protocols. For example, optimal charge
stabilization strategies can be found through quantum
control techniques for different relevant dynamical sce-
narios [105], including non-Markovian environments. Ad-

ditionally, they can be utilized in the selective charging
and extraction of specific ergotropic components. Such
operations could be harnessed to design novel thermody-
namic cycles whose strokes internally redistribute charge
while maintaining a fixed energy budget. Also, one can
study the potential use of non-isoergotropic local opera-
tions along with global isoergotropic processes in multi-
cell quantum batteries. Finally, by taking isoergotropic
transformations as free operations, one can build a re-
source theory of ergotropy in direct analogy with stan-
dard quantum resource theories (see the review [106]).
Framed this way, ergotropy can be integrated with exist-
ing resource theories of coherence [78] and Gaussianity
[107], enabling analyses beyond the usual settings. No-
tably, recent work has designed nonlinear coherent heat
machines that convert passive Gaussian states into non-
Gaussian active ones [108]. This indicates that nonlinear-
ity cannot be treated as a free resource in any continuous-
variable resource theory of ergotropy. Investigating the
interplay among these resources—and identifying appro-
priate monotones and conversion rules—would be valu-
able, but lies beyond the scope of the present work.
