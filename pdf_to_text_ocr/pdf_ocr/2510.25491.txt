Abstract

Decoherence of quantum bits arises primarily from the parasitic resistance within the qubit. This study presents the analysis of the
decoherence process due to physical interactions between the qubit photons and parasitic resistance atoms, utilizing exclusively the
Caldeira-Leggett electrical model, without relying on external Hamiltonians. The analysis shows a good agreement between the model
of the electrical noise and the Johnson-Nyquist noise. The emission and absorption rates of the qubit’s coherence loss, required for the
Lindblad master equation that approximates the decoherence, are obtained. A numerical substitution in the analysis result yields a strong
correlation with previous measurements. The present analysis enables also the derivation of the appropriate circuit characteristics for

future simulations.

1. Introduction

The fundamental unit of information in quantum computing is
the quantum bit, commonly referred to as a qubit. The most
common implementation of qubits is by superconducting
Josephson Junctions. These qubits are controlled using an external
voltage source [1]. Once a qubit is set to a specific quantum state,
a combination of the first two eigenstates, |0) and |1), it starts to
experience decoherence [2], the process where the coherence
between the two eigenstates is lost. This loss of coherence is
primarily due to the parasitic resistance within the qubit [3], which
has two main causes: the emission of photons into the resistor with
the involvement of atoms in this process, as well as the absorption
of photons that are excited by the thermal vibrations of the
resistor's atoms.

The decoherence process has been investigated based on several
theoretical approaches. Breuer and Petruccione [4] give reference
to prior works [5,6] that utilize a Hamiltonian based on a single
qubit interacting with its environment [7], and the Caldeira-
Leggett model [8], known as the spin-boson model Hamiltonian.
Alternatively, the Ising model was used to describe the
decoherence process [9]. Recent works [10, 11, 12] investigate
decoherence by pure mathematical analysis based on physical and
mathematical models which have no correlation with any
electrical circuit model. The first to use an electric field model to
represent the internal resistance of the qubit, to derive quantum
fluctuations, was Devoret [13]. He employed the Foster model
[14] to replace the resistance of the qubit by an infinite number of
parallel LC resonators connected in series. A subsequent effort by
Cataneo and Paraoanu [15] provided a comprehensive review of
the decoherence process, for both a single qubit and two qubits
connected to external resistors, using small serial capacitors.
However, this work analyzed only the influence of external
resistors on qubit's decoherence, ignoring the part of qubit's
internal resistance.

Along the lines of the previous works, mainly that of Cataneo
and Paraoanu [15], we introduce a comprehensive analysis of the
Hamiltonian for a qubit with parasitic resistance, based on the
Foster model of the resistance. We calculate the parameters of the
model and employ the Lindblad master equation [16] to analyze
and simulate the decoherence process.

2. Calculation Process

To simplify the analysis of the decoherence process, it is
necessary to assume that the qubit is in an initial quantum state,
disconnected from the surroundings, as shown in Fig. 1.

Resistors cannot be included in the circuit Hamiltonian due to
lack of energy conservation. To overcome this problem, Devoret
[13] replaced the resistors by an infinite number of LC resonators
connected in series as shown in Fig. 2. The resonators differ from
one another by their resonance frequencies, 1 /VinCy , that equals
kAw for the k’th resonator, and by the section admittance, ./ Cy /L
that its value is set using the required bath resistance function
Rg (ax).

Fig. 2 * Qubit electrical model employing a thermal reservoir,
representing the resistor by a set of resonators.

During transient time, following an input signal to the bath
circuit with a finite number of resonators, the circuit behavior is
similar to that of a resistor. With increasing time, the bath circuit
behavior changes to a reactive network. As the number of the
resonators increases to infinity, the transient time at which the bath
circuit behaves as resistor, approaches to infinity as well.
Therefore, the behavior of the network can be seen as an
impedance with a significant resistive component and a negligible
reactive component, but only within a limited frequency range, as
discussed in section 4.

The calculation procedure for determining the decoherence
process of the circuit shown in Fig. 2 is performed using six major
steps:

1) System and bath Hamiltonian
2)  Resistor’s bath reactive model
3) Thermal noise of the resistor
4) Emission and absorption rates
5) Coherent wave decay constant

6) Solution of the system’s Lindblad equation

These steps are discussed in the following sections.

3. System and Bath Hamiltonian

the following set of equations

The last term in equation (5) is the interaction Hamiltonian. It
represents the energy in the i, current loop. This loop expresses
the interaction between the qubit and the resonators in the bath.
The absence of a capacitor in the interaction loop poses a challenge
in describing the system by known operators and eigen-functions.
Therefore, it is necessary to characterize the interaction flux as a
dependent function of the fluxes of the other inductors in the
circuit. A short way to do this, is to retreat to the equations set (2)
and to calculate its Laplace transform in the following manner

4. Resistor’s Bath Reactive Model

We employ the Fermi Golden Rule [21] for the calculation of
emission and absorption rates. To that end, the energy states
density associated with the qubit states are required. We start with
the calculation of the bath frequency response. At every junction
in the bath, the current is given by

dv,

tp = Cea t tk ; k =1,2...00 (15)

Hence, the Laplace transform of the total bath impedance is

7, a2 y 1 os 1 6
en ip Ely S@+ aR” [Ty Cy (6)
This impedance represents the reactance part only. However, if the
inductance and capacitance components of the resonator tend to
zero and the number of resonators tends to infinity, the resistive
component becomes significant. The ideal impedance of the bath
network is equal to the qubit's parasitic resistance for all
frequencies. However, it is not achievable with a reactive network.
The practical alternative is to form a target impedance function
that presents the required impedance in a band limited frequency
response. This target impedance function has a real and an

imaginary part as follows

Zp (@) = Rew) + j Xe) (17)

To create the target resistance, we define a set of parallel
resonators, where the resonance frequency of the k’th resonator
equals to kAw , and its section admittance, Cui Ln , is set so that
the section bandwidth will be 2Aw. In that way we form the
required bath resistance Rg (w,) :

G
Qn = nao fe

where Q;, is the section’s quality factor. The scattering parameter
S21 of the first five resonators of the bath circuit with k = 1,..,5,
as a function of the normalized frequency w/w, , are shown in Fig.
3. Each resonator is separately connected as a terminated 2 port
circuit with a Rg(@,) resistor.

Thus, using equation (21)a , we can conclude that the relation
Zp = j Xp represents a part of a more extensive bath impedance as
seen in equation (17). This result is attributed to the infinite
number of resonators in this model.

For a finite number of resonators, a real part behavior is
observed only during a transient time following the initial
excitation, and it vanishes gradually in time. As the response
reaches stable conditions, only the imaginary part is retained. As
the number of resonators is increased, the duration of the transient
time grows, ultimately reaching an infinite value when an infinite
number of resonators are used. This implies the presence of a
constant real part in the impedance.

We proceed to establish an arbitrary realizable band limited
formula of the resistive part of the impedance. Next, we substitute
this into equation (21)a to calculate the reactive part, as follows

The resistive part equation presents a combination of High-Pass

Frequency (HPF) and Low-Pass Frequency (LPF) responses. The

purpose of incorporating the HPF response part, over Cataneo and

Paraoanu [15] approach , is to prevent the occurrence of
singularity while calculating the loop interaction inductor L, by
equation (4).

By plotting the relative dimensions of the real and imaginary
parts of equation (22), using arbitrary values of wp, and w, , we
obtain the following curves

The above analysis fails to include the DC case, w=0. In this case,
the flow of current is limited only to the bath inductors, resulting
in an impedance value of zero.

5. Thermal Noise on the Resistor

In this chapter, we will analyze the thermal properties of the
resistor's model described in equation (22) and demonstrate its
close relation to the well-known Johnson-Nyquist noise [24].

Noise Spectral Density

To calculate the spectrum density, we start with deriving the
correlation function of the voltage drop across the resistor by
calculating the auto-correlation function for each LC resonator at
the bath electrical model, as follows

C® (0) = (ve (OVE (OD) = (P(t b:e(O)) 908)

Three functions must be calculated for (23)

The physical interpretation of the states weighting function V(w)
is attained from the limit lim n(@) = 0, since only the positive

frequency part of N(w) remains. In the limit of T approaching
zero, the system is only in the absorption state, with no emission.
This leads to the following classification

N(w) = n(-—@) (26)

and the bath HPF to 1MHz, about 10,000 smaller than qubit
frequency. The derived power density of the resistor bath is shown

which is similar to the known Johnson-Nyquist noise [24], except
for the factor of 2 instead of 4 in the Johnson-Nyquist model. This
difference is due to the different frequency ranges. The Johnson-
Nyquist model applies for positive frequencies, while equation
(29) includes both the positive and the negative ranges.

Fig. 7 + Emission and absorption time constants vs. temperature.

The dependence of these rates on temperature is demonstrated in
the curves in Fig. 7. The time constants here are Tyg = 1/Tea -
As can be seen, one can use a single qubit for a reasonable time
for temperatures below 1K. These emission and absorption rates,
appear in the general Lindblad master equation, as follows [27] :

where

© ps = Ps(t) is the non-dissipative system's density matrix

e {A,B} = AB + BA are the anti-commutative brackets

e 6, =I, (t) is the emission rate

e =Tq =TQ(E) is the absorption rate

Assuming that the absorption rate is negligible relative to the
emission rate, and using the expressions of equation (48), we
obtain

To demonstrate a numerical behavior of equations (82), we chose
typical parameters in Fig. 8. In this example, the resonance
frequency of the qubit is 13.5GHz. The qubit operates at a
temperature of 10mK, with an emission time constant of 332sec
as designated in Fig. 7 above. The initial state, |+) =

$5 (lo) +|1)) , is with equal probabilities for the two first states

of the

qubit and zero phase angle 59 between the states.

CONCLUSIONS

model parameters are obtained by comparing coherent wave

time response to classical circuit response. The numerical results
based on extensive analysis confirm the experimental results that
over a temperature of about 0.6K, a high degradation of the
coherence is observed. The decaying rate is dependent on the
state, the |1) state decays much faster than the |0) state.

The

calculation presented in this work suggests a process that

opens a way for a deterministic method to analyze the qubit
decoherence for a variety of internal parasitic resistance types.
