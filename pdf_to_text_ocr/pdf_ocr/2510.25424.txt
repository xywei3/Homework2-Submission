Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic reshaped human mobility through policy interventions and volun-
tary behavioral changes. Mobility adaptions helped mitigate pandemic spread, however our
knowledge which environmental, social, and demographic factors helped mobility reduction
and pandemic mitigation is patchy. We introduce a Bayesian hierarchical model to quantify
heterogeneity in mobility responses across time and space in Germany’s 400 districts using
anonymized mobile phone data. Decomposing mobility into a disease-responsive component

and disease-independent factors (temperature, school vacations, public holidays) allows us

to quantify the impact of each factor. We find significant differences in reaction to disease

spread along the urban-rural gradient, with large cities reducing mobility most strongly.
Employment sectors further help explain variance in reaction strength during the first wave,

while political variables gain significance during the second wave. However, reduced mobility

only partially translates to lower peak incidence, indicating the influence of other hidden
factors. Our results identify key drivers of mobility reductions and demonstrate that mobility

behavior can serve as an operational proxy for population response.

1 Introduction

During the COVID-19 pandemic, people substantially adapted their mobility patterns as case numbers
increased and official guidelines and policy evolved: social visits were postponed, meetings and shopping
shifted online, public transport during peak-hour was avoided, stay-at-home rules were observed, and school
were closed. These adjustments combined both voluntary adaptations due to increased personal risk and
compliance to government-mandated non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), making mobility an immediate
indicator of population response [HB]. Indeed, investigations show that time spent away from home mediates

exposure opportunities; fewer minutes spent in shared spaces translate into fewer contacts and a lower effective

reproduction number Because many control measures directly affect mobility, tracking it shows whether

interventions take effect, where additional support is needed, and how quickly behavior adapts. Importantly,
these responses can be measured in near real time, due to the availability of anonymized mobile-phone data

at population scale

The magnitude and timing of mobility reductions differ across time and space. Voluntary responses and
NPI compliance depend on local information environments and social norms, workplace constraints and
the feasibility of remote work, and, critically, trust in institutions (9). Furthermore, structural conditions,
including housing density, income, work opportunities, infrastructure, and dependency on public transport,
differ along the urban-rural gradient, so the same NPIs and case numbers can yield different reductions in
out-of-home duration in different locations. This variation matters: it changes when and where transmission
accelerates, and it determines whether finite resources such as testing and hospital capacity are deployed

equitably and most effectively. Yet most studies quantify mobility adaptations at national or international

scales or, when subnational, focus on metropolitan areas , leaving rural and small-town contexts

comparatively underexplore: . Improving the understanding of how responses vary across the urban-

rural gradient fills an essential research gap that will improve transmission modeling, targeted communication,

and fair allocation of interventions

To quantify differences along the urban-rural gradient, we focus on Germany during the first year of the

COVID-19 pandemic, quantifying changes in local mobility for all 400 German districts (Landkreise and

kreisfreie Stddte). We use out-of-home duration — the amount of time spent away from one’s home — as our
mobility measure, drawing on anonymized cellular data from a major German mobile telecommunications
provider. This sample encompasses up to 30 million devices. Unlike reported case incidence, which serves as
a key epidemiological metric but represents a delayed and composite behavioral signal influenced by testing
and reporting practices, baseline transmissibility, and other protective behaviors, out-of-home duration offers
a more immediate and direct measure of behavioral response to COVID-19.

In this study, we develop a Bayesian hierarchical model that decomposes out-of-home duration into a
disease-responsive component and three disease-independent drivers (temperature, school vacations, and
public holidays). The disease term combines national and local incidence through a weighted finite-memory
signal and allows for pandemic fatigue, yielding a district-specific reaction strength to disease spread. Our
model successfully disentangles the different components, finding that the disease term is the leading factor
impacting out-of-home duration. We find significant difference in the reaction strength to disease spread along
the urban-rural gradient, with large cities reducing most strongly. We then relate cross-district heterogeneity
in reaction strength to demographic and socioeconomic covariates. Finally, we analyze how mobility responses
interact with population density to shape peak incidence across waves. We find that the urban-rural differences,
together with the social and economic variables, explain a large part of the variance of the reaction strength
across districts. However, this reduction of mobility only translates partly into a reduction of the peak
incidence height, as other factors remain influential. Overall, our work provides a deeper understanding of
the relationship between the progression of the pandemic, the mobility response and how demographic, social,

economic and political variables influence this relationship.

2.1 Analysis Overview

COVID-19 shaped the 2020 annual course of the out-of-home duration in Germany’s 400 districts through
a combination of government-mandated interventions and voluntary cutbacks in social and work related

travel 3}. Our objective is to quantify the strength of this joint effect and to identify the demographic

and socioeconomic characteristics that influenced it. Because time spent outside the home mediates exposure
opportunities, reductions in out-of-home duration strongly affect transmission dynamics and thus a wave’s
incidence peak J. At the same time, peak incidence reflects additional influences, including protective
behaviors like mask-wearing or vaccinations and differences in the baseline reproduction numbers across
districts. Consequently, we regress both mobility reduction and peak incidence on socioeconomic and

demographic factors to understand their cross-dependencies. We structure the analysis in three steps:

1. a Bayesian model for weekly decreases in out-of-home duration driven by disease spread alongside

three disease-independent factors,

2. a linear model attributing cross-district variation in these decreases to population density and
demographic and socioeconomic covariates,

3. astructural equation model attributing cross-district variation in peak incidence to the same covariates

and additionally to the average decrease in out-of-home duration.

2.2 Impact of Disease Spread on Out-of-home Duration

Our Bayesian model spans the 52-week period from March 2020 to March 2021. The multiplicative model
represent the out-of-home duration D,(t) for each week t € T = {1,...,52} and each German district
dé D= {1,...,400}. We assume that the out-of-home duration is determined by a baseline out-of-home
duration, COVID-19 disease spread, and by three disease-independent factors: temperature, school vacations,
and public holidays (see Fig. [I]for a reduced graphical representation of the model and Table[l] for introduction
of underlying data bases and sources).

We assume these factors are multiplicative (i.e., additive in log-space) because we assume changes in one
factor do not induce changes in another, and because their effects can be expressed as multiples of a base

level. The model reads:
Dat) = Dpase,a « Ca(t) « (Wa(t) - Va(t) - Ha(t)). (1)

The baseline out-of-home duration Dpase,d represents the out-of-home duration in district d during a week
without disease spread, without school vacations, no public holidays, and with annual average temperature.
This baseline out-of-home duration Dpase,a is multiplied by Cy(t), a factor depending on the COVID-19
disease spread. The disease factor Cq(t) is based on the COVID-19 incidence rate (new weekly cases per

First, based on the assumption that both local and national disease dynamics influence mobility behavior, a
weighted average of the normalized local and normalized national COVID-19 incidence rate is computed.
Second, as the population is not only influenced by the current incidence, but also by that of the recent past,

incidence is convolved with a Gamma distribution. Third, assuming that the population’s perception of risk

during the second COVID-19 wave. While the model successfully captures these trends, it leaves opportunity

for improvement at two specifi

c time points. First, the model predicts the local minimal out-of-home duration

in spring 2020 too late (Model: April 5th, 2020 vs Data: March 15th, 2020). Second, the model does not

capture a temporary spike in out-ofhome duration observed in late November 2020 to early December 2020,

which interrupted the otherwise declining trend in out-of-home duration. A potential explanation for this

spike is the looming stricter lockdown that was finally announced on December 13th, 2020 and took effect on

disease-independent factors Wa(t), Va(t), and Ha(t). The disease factor Ca(t) decreases the out-of-home duration most

The disease factor Ca decreased the out-of-home duration substantially more in spring 2020 than in
winter 2020/2021. All three disease-independent factors, school vacations, public holidays, and temperature,
significantly influence the out-of-home duration during the two COVID-19 waves. Temperature has a
decreasing effect only until mid-April 2020 and an increasing effect over the warm summer months (May —

September). Overall, the findings demonstrate that disease spread dominated the out-of-home duration in
Inferring Mobility Reductions from COVID-19 Disease Spread along the Urban-Rural Gradient

districts as diverse as Berlin, Gottingen, and Prignitz, while seasonal and holiday factors provided secondary
but consistent reinforcing effects.

In the three exemplary districts of Berlin, Géttingen, and Prignitz, the disease spread had a stronger
multiplicative effect on out-of-home duration than the three disease-independent factors (F igB]middle column),
with substantially larger reductions in spring 2020 than in winter 2020/2021. The three disease-independent
factors — school vacations, public holidays, and temperature — significantly influenced out-of-home duration,
provide secondary but consistent reinforcing effects, with temperature decreasing mobility until mid-April 2020
and increasing it during the warm summer months (May—September).

Expanding the analysis from the three exemplary districts to all 400 German districts (Fig. fA), the

disease factor consistently emerges as the strongest influence on out-of-home duration, confirming the pattern

observed for Berlin, Géttingen, and Prignitz: During the first wave, the disease factor Ca(t) reduces the
out-of-home duration most strongly in the week ending April 19th, 2020, reaching a median multiplicative
impact of 0.77, IQR: ([0.73, 0.80]) (Fig. fc). Despite higher incidences during the winter 2020/2021 wave,
the disease factor reduces out-of-home duration less than during spring 2020, reaching a median maximal
multiplicative impact of 0.82 (IQR: [0.79, 0.85]). This suggests that pandemic fatigue fully compensates the

effect of higher incidences. The difference in out-of-home duration between winter and summer is about

11%, with a median multiplicative impact of 1.06 (IQR: [1.05, 1.07]) during the warm summer months
(May-September) and 0.95 (IQR: [0.94, 0.95]) during the winter. The decreasing impact of school vacations
and public holidays is even smaller: The median difference between weeks with school vacations and weeks
without is 4% (same effect is inferred for all districts; boxes in Fig.[]C represent that during the corresponding

week school vacations occurred in some districts but not in others, rather than a difference in effect size).

The median difference between weeks with public holiday(s) and without is 3%. In summary, across districts
and just like for the exemplary districts of Berlin, Géttingen, and Prignitz, disease spread most strongly
reduces the out-of-home duration, followed by the influence of temperature and modest reductions due to

school vacations and public holidays.

2.3 Stronger Mobility Reductions in More Densely-Populated Districts

n order to understand the differences in reduction of out-of-home duration between districts, we first
investigate how much it depends on rural versus urban differences. To this end, we classified districts into
five district types: large city, small city, suburban/independent town, medium rural, and rural (using the
classification system of the German Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs, and Spatial
Development). We do not directly use the reduction of out-of-home duration as our variable of interest, but
he reaction strength of the out-of-home duration with respect to the incidence. We use reaction strength as
we expect that for districts with high local incidence, the decrease in out-of-home duration will be stronger
(even if that effect is not so strong, as most of the district are more strongly tied to the national incidence,
Fig. fa). As reaction strength we used the average impact of the incidence on the reduction of out-of-home
duration, which is mathematically the integral of our exponential decay function. Comparison across district
pes revealed a large differences: large cities exhibited on average the largest reaction strength, while rural

districts showed the weakest response (Fig.

A). T-tests comparing mean reaction strength across district

types confirmed significant differences between the four more densely populated district types: large city vs
small city (p < 0.01), small city vs suburban/independent town (p < 0.001), and suburban/independent town

vs medium rural (p < 0.001). Finally, the difference in mean reaction strength reaches a plateau, with no

statistically significant difference observed between medium rural and rural districts (p > 0.05). Overall, this
demonstrates a clear urban-rural gradient in response to disease spread, with reaction strength decreasing
systematically from large cities to rural areas.

However, differentiation by district type does not suffice to fully explain the observed differences in mobility
reduction in the 400 districts (see Fig. BIB, in general smaller polygons represent cities). For instance, we
observe strong reactions in the west of Germany, particularly all across North Rhine-Westphalia. Meanwhile,
northern Bavaria (specifically the Upper Palatinate region) shows only moderate reactions, even in the city
districts. Furthermore, we are interested in whether urbanness is really the main factor that influences
urban-rural differences in mobility reduction, or whether partially-collinear demographic or economic factors
also play a role.

To better understand which factors are responsible for the observed differences in mobility reduction,

we regressed nineteen potentially relevant demographic, socioeconomic, and political variables that encode

differences between districts on the reaction strength during the first wave and on the reaction strength during

second wave separately (defined as the integral over the corresponding wave, see Section

precisely, as demographic variables we considered population density, average age, and share of 65+ year
old people; as economic variables we considered the average income, employment and unemployment rate,
economic sectors (agriculture, forestry fisheries, manufacturing sector, construction, service sectors, trace,
transport, hospitality, information, communication (TTHIC) sectors, finance sector); and as sociological and

political variables we considered the share of small children in childcare, the voter turnout, and share of

votes of any of the political parties that received more than 5% of votes in the 2021 federal election (see
Supplementary Table [3] for overview and summary statistics). Exhaustive search and comparison of model

selection criteria (adjusted R?, Mallow’s C,, AIC, and BIC) determined which explanatory variables were

considered in the final regression on reaction strength. In the regression, we then used the set of variables for

for details).

A. Large cities display the greatest average reaction strength, with reaction strength structurally decreasing along

reaction strength spatially highlights great reaction strength in cities (small polygons) and in the west of Germany,

contrasting with modest reaction strengths in parts of the former GDR and northern Bavaria.

We find that during the first COVID-19 wave, unemployment rate and population density contribute most

strongly to explaining variance in reaction strength, with similar strong effects (Figure [6] A and Table [6] for

detailed model output). The strong contribution of population density was expected from the large differences
in reaction strength between rural and urban areas (F' igure J] A). The strong contribution of unemployment
rate may be explained by the fact that the economy of high-unemployment districts is often concentrated
in sectors that are more vulnerable to pandemic disruptions (retail, hospitality, manual labor). During
an outbreak, these jobs get shut down or drastically reduced, yielding a stronger reaction 27]. Another
explanation may be that high-unemployment districts often have a generally weak economy such that even
without strict lockdowns, economic hardship enforces staying home. Furthermore, the regression coefficients of
three other independent variables are also significantly different from zero (p < 0.05, not multiple comparison

corrected): agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, voter turnout, and FDP. For income, the regression coefficient

is significantly different from zero at a significance level of p = 0.1. We have some proposals for the causal
relationship between the decrease in out-of-home duration and these four variables: Agriculture, forestry,
fishers is an economic sectors with little to no home office feasibility, forcing employees into the workplace,
thus limiting reaction strength. Voter turnout may be understood as a measure of political trust, and as such,

high voter turnout enhances adherence to guidelines and consequently staying at home . Voting for

FDP correlates with political convictions that may discourage reducing one’s mobility. A higher average
income is correlated with white-collar jobs, which allow for remote work more readily, increasing reaction

strength To conclude, however, these variables might not have direct causal connections, and may rather

be indicative of underlying social and economic conditions that shape mobility responses.

level of p = 0.05): CDU, SPD, FDP, and AfD (Fig. (gj C and Table [6] for detailed model output). A
possible explanation may be that during the first wave, nonpharmacceutical interventions and communication
strategies were implemented nationally, uniting society in an attempt to flatten the curve. These national

implementations dictated home office feasibility and on-work site necessity clearly. During the second wave,

this authority shifted more and more from the national to the federal state level, highlighting the different

approaches of the political parties (and consequently their voters) to disease spread. The regression coefficient
of unemployment rate is still statistically significant from zero (p < 0.05), but comparable in magnitude to
those of the political variables. In contrast, the regression coefficient of population density is not statistically
different from zero anymore.

Together, our findings suggest that mobility responses shifted from being primarily driven by structural
economic and demographic factors during the first wave to being increasingly shaped by election results and

regional governance during the second wave.

2.4 Cross-district Differences in Peak Incidence

Relevant for pandemic control, however, is not the strength of mobility reductions, but rather the peak height
of the infection waves, which determines the maximal burden on the health care system. Peak height, in
turn, depends on the decrease of mobility, but not exclusively. There certainly is a causal relationship, as a
reduction of out-of-home duration limits contacts and consequently reduces infection opportunities and thus

the effective reproduction number and peak height . However, other factors also play a role, such as

the local baseline reproduction number.

A key indication is that during the first wave the peak height does not reveal an urban-rural gradient which
we might have expected given the stronger decrease of mobility in urban districts (Figure[7] A). Moreover,
during the second wave, even though we observed the strongest reactions in cities, they also demonstrated
the largest peak height (Figure [7]B). The lack of urban-rural gradient suggests that rural areas may have a
smaller baseline reproduction number. Differences in baseline reproduction may then, in turn, be traced back
to demographic and socioeconomic factors.

To investigate these hypotheses, we used structural equation modeling, regressing on peak incidence of the
first and the second wave separately. As explanatory variables we considered the demographic, socioeconomic,
and political variables of the previous section. Reaction strength entered the structural equation models as a
mediator. If the peak incidence of either wave was driven solely by mobility reductions, only reaction strength
should be significant, with other variables’ effects mediated through it.

For both waves the reaction strength, i.e. our mobility measure, contributes to a decrease in peak incidence

(Figure[6]C, D, for the second wave, only at a significance level of p < 0.1. Note that the x-axis is flipped, for
easier comparison with panels A and B). In contrast, population density has an increasing effect, counteracting
the reaction strength, which might explain nearly the constant or increasing peak height from rural to urban
districts. Indeed, urban areas must react more strongly in order to compensate for their higher population

density, which often coincides with crowded public spaces, smaller living spaces, and a higher share of public

transport, which all facilitate disease spread |32|}33|. Otherwise, agriculture, forestry, fisheries is the only
variable whose regression coefficient does not change its sign between the first and second wave. Thus,
interpreting the influence of the other socioeconomic and political factors is difficult, despite them having a

relatively high impact during both waves. Similarly as for the regression on reaction strength, this might be

a indication that the context of the first and second wave was different, from mitigation being driven more by

Germany-wide interventions and restrictions during the first wave, to more federal state wide interventions

and voluntary cautious behavior during the second wave. Taken together, these results show that our measure

of mobility is only one of the factors determining the COVID-19 spread and spreading models and predictions

may be improved by taking into account the composite of mobility and other environmental factors.

Inferring Mobility Reductions from COVID-19 Disease Spread along the Urban-Rural Gradient

3 Discussion

We quantified the change in local mobility in Germany’s 400 districts during the first year of the COVID-19
pandemic year using out-of-home durations derived from anonymized cellular data. For each week, our
hierarchical Bayesian model decomposes the out-of-home duration into a product of a baseline out-of-home
duration, a disease factor based on the local and national COVID-19 incidence, and three disease-independent
factors (temperature, school vacations, public holidays). Three findings stand out: First, the model successfully
reproduces both the timing and the magnitude of the major reductions in out-of-home duration across districts.
This required incorporating a disease factor with diminishing impact over time, reflecting pandemic fatigue.
Second, national incidence carries more weight in explaining mobility behavior than local incidence. Third,

districts’ reductions in out-of-home duration in response to disease spread varied significantly across space,

decreasing systematically from large cities to rural areas.

Our Bayesian inference model attributes most of the reduction in out-of-home duration to disease spread,
secondary effects to temperature and only modest reduction to calendar effects (school vacations, public
. Our

framework, however, cannot fully disentangle the drivers behind the impact of disease spread on behavior.

holidays), aligning with evidence that policy and perceived risk jointly drive mobility changes

The disease factor, which captures the reaction to incidence, combines government-mandated and voluntary

responses that co-vary with incidence and media coverage |3 , which must be considered when interpreting
our results. Importantly, to infer the out-ofhome duration successfully, the disease factor has to incorporate

that the reduction in out-of-home duration resulting from disease spread weakens over time. This gradual

relaxation is consistent with survey-based evidence on declining adherence , though the underlying
mechanisms — habituation, economic pressure, poor communication — need further investigation and may
vary between subpopulations.

The stronger influence of national compared to local incidence suggests that information and policy signals
were integrated on a national level. This is plausible in Germany, where nationwide announcements and

broadly coordinated measures dominated in 2020 [39]. Heavily weighting the national incidence also reflects

that mobility behaviors are coupled across districts through commuting and media consumption. However, we
do not claim this weight to be universal: in settings with highly decentralized policies or localized outbreaks,
local incidence may matter more. Understanding how people weight varying signals remains an open problem
with implications for the timing and targeting of NPIs and communication strategies.

We found districts to vary significantly in how much they reduced out-of-home duration in response
to disease spread, with reductions decreasing systematically from large cities to rural areas. The observed
urban-rural gradient in out-of-home duration reduction can be motivated by higher vulnerability and baseline

contact opportunities in cities , yet density alone cannot fully account for the variation. Regional

clusters indicate that inter-district connectivity, sectoral composition, and early outbreak histories also
matter 3]. Political and social context likely contributes as well: our trust-proxy (voter turnout) correlates

with stronger reductions, echoing work linking trust in government and institutions to adherence fg 3

Differences in home office feasibility by occupation further support larger potential reductions in higher-income,
service-oriented urban districts {30}. These observations are supported by our regression, where population

density and unemployment rate were the dominant correlates, followed by modest contributions of additional

14
Inferring Mobility Reductions from COVID-19 Disease Spread along the Urban-Rural Gradient

socio-economic and political covariates (voter turnout, income, industries with little home office feasibility,
voting shares).

Importantly, however, stronger mobility reductions did not automatically translate into smaller local
incidence peak height: We did not observe a clear urban-rural gradient in peak height for the first wave, and
cities experienced larger peaks during the second wave despite stronger reductions.

There are three caveats one has to keep in mind when interpreting our results. First, smartphone-based
measures can under-represent specific demographics (e.g., the very old or young) and essential workers,

potentially biasing urban-rural comparisons Second, district-level covariates risk ecological fallacy. As

coefficients are estimated on between-district variation, their magnitudes also reflect how much each covariate
varies across districts. Variables with limited between-district variation (even if heterogeneous within districts)
will yield smaller standardized regression coefficients. Individual-level data could improve model accuracy
and help understand equity implications. Third, the inferred importance of population density is robust and

aligns with known structural differences, but the socio-economic factors with smaller coefficients — income,

unemployment, childcare, voter turnout — may be proxies for latent constructs (job mix, employer practices,
information environments). Natural experiments that shift these factors, for instance change in home office

feasibility or closure of childcare facilities, would be needed to isolate mechanisms . As a result, our

regression and structural equation model should be read as explanatory rather than causal.
A central methodological choice we made is the mobility measure. We argue that the out-of-home

duration is an appropriate choice, as it directly tracks time potentially spent in shared physical spaces and is

comparable across districts and weeks. This contrasts with distance-based measures, trip counts, or venue
visitation indices, which capture different behavioral facets . Out-of-home duration aggregates across

rip purposes without requiring venue classification and maps naturally to contact time in many settings,

hough it does not distinguish crowded from sparse environments, indoor from outdoor time, or clustering

. This limitation becomes

at specific locations — all of which influence transmission dynamics
evident in the imperfect link between reductions in out-of-home duration and peak incidence: Within-own
household transmissions, crowding in essential workplaces, and lack of other self-protective behaviors (e.g.

mask-wearing) can sustain spread even when time away from home declines . Additionally, cities may

need larger reductions to offset inherently higher contact opportunities linked to crowding in places ranging

from home to public transport vehicles . This underscores the need to integrate a mobility quantity with

context (who, where, how crowded) to improve predictive value. Combining duration with occupancy and

indoor-air proxies, and modeling network structure explicitly , are promising directions.

Some aspects of our modeling approach present opportunities for improvement. For instance, our disease

factor combines local and national incidence for Germany but does not include cross-border epidemiological

dynamics, which may affect border regions 7. Furthermore, we observe that minimal out-of-home duration
in early March 2020 preceded incidence peak; incorporating additional drivers — such as media and

risk-perception signals or international incidence — may improve timing, especially at the start of waves

Despite these limitations, our findings have practical implications. As out-of-home duration is measurable

in near real time, it can serve as an operational proxy for population response, complementing slower

epidemiologic indicators fai]. Further, the observed urban-rural gradient suggests calibrating communication
and support locally: dense cities may require earlier or stronger measures to achieve comparable risk

reduction, while rural areas may benefit from tailored strategies that address different job mixes and transport

4 Methods

4.1 Input Variables

4.1.1 Temperature

In Germany, weather influences the out-of-home duration throughout the year, with warmer temperatures
motivating individuals to spend extended periods outside their homes, whereas lower temperatures promote
staying at home

November to February — temperatures are low, partly dropping below the freezing point, while the summer

Temperatures hereby follow a seasonal pattern: During the winter months —

months — June to August — bring high temperatures up to 30°C (Fig. [). During the study period,
the maximal average german temperature was recorded mid-August 2020, whereas the minimal average
temperature was recorded in February 2021. For our analysis, we consider the weekly average of the daily
maximum temperature. Whenever temperature data is unavailable for a district, we consider the average
temperature of all bordering districts for which temperature data is available. In sum, weather affects

the out-of-home duration, with higher temperatures encouraging time spent outside one’s home and lower

point) and summer highs (up to 30°C).

ribbons represent the 95% interpercentile range. The global maximum temperature occurs mid-August 2020. From

then onwards, temperature steadily decreases until it reaches a global minimum in February 2021.

4.1.2 School Vacation

School vacations decrease the out-of-home duration through two mechanisms: directly by keeping children
from going to school and indirectly by requiring parents to take vacation days or work remotely to look after
their children. In Germany, school vacations differ by federal state, with most states having spring, summer,
fall, and winter breaks. For each week, we sum up the number of school vacation days (Fig. [). As children
in Germany go to school from Monday until Friday, the maximum number of school vacation days per week
is five. Summer vacation (between July and September), with a duration of six weeks in most federal states,
represents the longest break period. Overall, school vacations decrease the weekly out-of-home duration by
keeping children home from school and prompting parents to take vacation days, with timing varying across

German federal states due to different vacation schedules.

have four breaks: spring, summer, fall, and winter, with summer vacation (July — September) representing the longest

break period.

4.1.3 Public holidays

Public holidays that fall on weekdays decrease the out-of-home duration both directly by exempting many
employees from work and indirectly by encouraging many employees to take additional vacation days on
the weekdays preceding and/or following the public holiday. This decreases the out-of-home duration
on the public holiday itself and the days adjacent to the public holiday, which, in turn, decreases the
weekly average out-of-home duration. In Germany, some public holidays are national holidays (including
Easter Monday, New Year’s Eve, and New Year’s Day), while others differ by federal state (including
International Women’s Day and All Saints’ Day). For each week, we sum up the number of public holidays

that fall on a weekday (Fig. . During the study period, Christmas week was the only week with two public

holidays. Overall, public holidays decrease the weekly out-of-home duration both directly through work-free

days and indirectly through adjacent vacation days, with effects varying by region due to differences in federal

holiday schedules.

Christmas week has two public holidays; all other weeks contain a single holiday or none.

4.1.4 COVID-19 Case Numbers
In Germany, the first COVID-19 case was detected on January 27th, 2020. Case numbers began to steeply rise
in March 2020, reaching the first local maximum between March 29th, 2020 and April 12th, 2020, depending

on the district (Fig. Across districts, the local maximum 7-day incidence/100,000 averaged 54 (median o'

maxima: 44, IQR: [27,67]). The height of the initial wave differed greatly across districts, with some districts
experiencing no first wave at all, and the highest outbreaks being observed in southern Germany and parts o!

North Rhine-Westphalia (Fig A). From the maximum onwards, case numbers decreased and remained low

throughout summer. Cases began to rise again beginning mid-September, reaching a second peak around

the turn of the year 2020/2021. Again, second wave heights differed greatly across districts, with a mean

maximum of 251 (median: 223, IQR: [181, 294]). Eastern Germany, specifically the districts close to Czechia,

endured the highest second waves (Fig.

B). Overall, during the first pandemic year, Germany experience

two pandemic waves, one in the spring and one in the fall-winter, with large differences between districts.

4.2 Output Variable: Out-of-home Duration

The out-of home duration is a measure of local mobility, describing the amount of time (in hours and per day)
an average person spends outside their home. This duration fluctuated considerably throughout the study
period, with the first change being observed in the second week of March 2020, when the out-of-home duration

sharply decreased (Fig. Contact reductions were introduced in the week ending March 23rd, 2020,

the week the out-of-home duration reached a local minimum. Rather than plateauing at this low point,
the out-of-home duration began to increase immediately, notably before the first governmental relaxations
(weeks ending May 4th, 2020 and May 11th, 2020). Throughout the summer of 2020, the out-ofhome

duration exceeded pre-pandemic levels from early March 2020, until mid-September, when another decrease in

out-of-home duration is observed. The so-called “lockdown light”, introduced on November 2nd, 2020, stopped

the decreasing trend and lead to a plateau (potentially due to hasty Christmas-shopping and the looming

24
Inferring Mobility Reductions from COVID-19 Disease Spread along the Urban-Rural Gradient

stronger lockdown). This plateau was followed by a dramatic decrease coinciding with more restrictive contact
measures introduced on December 16th, 2020. During the winter of 2020/2021, the out-of-home duration
fell to levels comparable to those observed during the initial COVID-19 wave in March 2020. Altogether,
the out-of-home fluctuated throughout the study period, declining sharply during lockdowns in March 2020
and winter 2020/2021, but exceeding pre-pandemic levels during summer 2020, with changes often occurring

before rather than after policy implementations.

Line represents the mean across districts, ribbons represent the 95% interpercentile range. Sharp decreases can be
observed in March and December 2020. Out-of-home duration does not plateau at the local minima, but immediately
rises again. During the summer 2020, out-of-home durations exceeding pre-pandemic levels from early March are

observed.

4.3 Bayesian hierarchical model

The model aims to infer the out-of-home duration Dg(t) for each German district d € {1,...,400} for each
week t € {1,...,52}, spanning the period from March 2020 until March 2021. We assume that the out-ofhome
duration D,(t) can be modeled as the product of a baseline out-of-home duration Dpase,a, multiplied by
a disease factor dependent on local and national COVID-19 spread Cy(t) and three disease-independent
factors (temperature Wa(t), school vacations Va(t), and public holidays Ha, Fig. [14] for graphical overview
and Table[2] for summary of prior distributions). We assume that these factors are multiplicative (ie. additive
in log-space) as changes in one factor do not yield changes in another and as we assume that their effects can

be expressed as multiplies of a base level. The multiplicative inference model reads:

Da(t) = Dyssear Walt) . Va(t) : Ha(t) . Ca(t) (2)

The different factors are discussed in the subsequent subsections.

Baseline Out-of-home Duration

The baseline out-of-home duration Dpase,q differs across districts: Districts with high concentration of
tradespeople, healthcare professionals, hospitality workers, or with a large share of employees working in
manufacturing or mining, typically have longer out-of-home durations as employees need to by physically
present onsite, forcing them to commute to work and leave their home. In contrast, districts dominated by
remote work, with high shares of retirees or high unemployment rates, may show lower baseline out-of-home
duration. Finally, commuting time is typically longer in rural than in urban areas, as employees in rural areas
need to cross greater distances to reach their worksite, increasing out-of-home duration (49). The baseline
out-of-home duration Dpase,q encapsulates this district-dependency, representing the out-of-home duration

during a week with no disease spread, no public holidays or school vacation, and average temperatures:
Dpase,d = Obase,d * 8,
where based = exp(HPase + Zbase,d * Obase)s
Zpase,d ~ N(0, 1),
Mase ~ N(0, 0.2),
Olase ~ HalfNormal(0.3).

The underlying assumption of Dpase,a is that the baseline out-of-home duration fluctuates around 8 hours,

reflecting the typical daily work time of a full-time employee in Germany.

26

Temperature

Weather — here represented by temperature — increases out-of-home duration during the warmer months
(typically April through September) and decreases out-of-home duration during the colder months (typically
October through March). We model this effect using a sigmoid function, which captures the saturation
of weather’s effect at the temperature extremes. The inflection point of the sigmoid takes on a value of 1,
representing a week with average annual temperature, where temperature neither in- nor decreases out-of-home
duration.

School Vacations

School vacations typically decrease out-of-home duration because students no longer attend schools and
parents often take vacation days or work remotely to care for their children. The more business days are

school vacation days, the stronger the reduction in week t.

by the school vacation, while the out-of-home duration on the weekend remains unaffected.

27
Inferring Mobility Reductions from COVID-19 Disease Spread along the Urban-Rural Gradient

Public Holidays

Public holidays that fall on weekdays decrease out-of-home duration both by exempting employees from work

and by incentivizing them to extend their time of by taking additional vacation days before and/or after the

holiday.

In Germany, the majority of full time employees works from Monday to Friday. Consequently, “#Public

holidays during week t” may take on integer values between 0 and 5. If every weekday of week ¢ is a public

holiday, then Ha(t) = 20nd + z, reflecting that only the out-of-home duration on the weekdays is affected by

the publich holiday, while the out-of-home duration on the weekend remains unaffected.

Disease Spread

We assume that the effect of disease spread on out-of-home duration to have a decreasing impact: High case

numbers motivate more stringent NPIs and increasec

risk perception which both, in turn, lead to smaller

out-of-home activity and consequently decrease out-of-home duration. The disease factor Ca(t) takes the

4. Fourth, as we assume it has a multiplicative effect, we take the exponential of the convoluted and

exponentially decayed case numbers. This also ensures a smaller than 1 multiplicative effect for

positive case numbers.

Together the disease factor reads:

4.4 Inference

We use the package PyMC to build the model and the NUTS sampler for inference via the library
Nutpie 52]. We use 2000 tuning steps and 1000 draws in 4 parallel chains. We made sure the chains converged,
as the R-hat value is below 1.07.

4.5 Multiple Regression

We explore differences across districts for three outcome variables: reaction strength, weight of local incidence,

and pandemic fatigue. To this end, we build a multiple linear regression model for each outcome variable,

considering population density as well as eighteen demographic, socio-economic, and political factors as

explanatory variables (Table [3] for overview of considered variables).

4.6 Linear Model Explaining Cross-District Variation in Reaction Strength

First analysis reveals significant differences in reaction strength between district types (Section|2 However,

district type — i.e. population density — alone does not suffice to fully explain the observed differences. To
explore the differences in reaction strength further, we conduct a multi-step analysis separated by wave. To
his end, we define reaction strength first wave as the integral over the exponential decay function for the
first 13 weeks of the study period, ranging from the week ending March 8th, 2020 until the week ending
May 31st, 2020, while we define reaction strength second wave as the integral over the exponential decay

function for the final 26 weeks of the study period, ranging from the week ending September 6th, 2020 until

he week ending February 28th, 2021. For each wave we follow the same four step approach:

1. Exploratory analysis of correlation coefficients of reaction strength and population density and eighteen
additional demographic, socioeconomic, and political explanatory variables (Table [3] for considered
variables).

2. Exhaustive search for each number of variables between 1 and 19. For each number of variables, we

chose the subset with the highest adjusted R?.
3. Model selection across subset sizes using (adjusted and predicted) R?, Mallow’s C,, AIC, and BIC.

4. Regression on reaction strength to determine the demographic, socioeconomic, and political variables’

ability to explain observed variance in reaction strength.

4.6.1 Exploratory Analysis

n the first analysis step, we consider linear correlations between reaction strength first wave and reaction
strength second wave on the one hand, and the explanatory variables on the other hand. Population density
shows the largest positive correlation with reaction strength first wave (0.60). The finance sector (0.55) and
he service sectors (0.48) exhibit the second and third largest positive correlations, respectively. A possible
explanation may be that the finance sector is dominated by white collar jobs which allow for remote work
more easily. In contrast, the service sectors were completely shut down for large parts of the COVID-19

pandemic, forcing employees to stay home and consequently explaining the strong positive correlation.

Finally, green party is also strongly positively correlated with reaction strength first wave (0.44). In contrast,
employment sectors that do not allow any remote work and necessitate on-site labor, are strongly negatively
correlated with reaction strength first wave: agriculture, forestry, fisheries (correlation coefficient of —0.47),
construction (—0.44), and the manufacturing sector (—0.43). Examining the correlation coefficients among
the explanatory variables reveals an extremely positive correlation between average age and 65+ year olds
(0.97). Manufacturing sector and service sectors are strongly negatively correlated (—0.99), and so are voter
turnout and unemployment rate (—0.74). We further observe a strong negative correlation between green
party and the right-wing party AfD (—0.70).

Examining reaction strength second wave yields similar patterns, though with slightly smaller correlation
coefficients. Again, reaction strength second wave is strongly positively correlated with population density
(0.50), the finance sector (0.48), green party (0.47), and the service sectors (0.46). Again, we observe strong
negative correlations with construction (—0.44), the manufacturing sector (—0.43), agriculture, forestry,

fisheries (—0.36).

Figure 15: Reaction strength of either wave is strongly correlated with population density and employment
sectors which easily or not at all permit remote work. Reaction strength correlates most strongly positively
with population density, service sectors, and finance sector. Agriculture, forestry, fisheries, manufacturing sector, and
construction are negatively correlated with reaction strength. A. Correlation coefficients of reaction strength first
wave and the 18 chosen explanatory variables. B. Correlation coefficients of reaction strength second wave and the 18

chosen explanatory variables. Only first the first row differs from panel A.

Overall, the correlation analysis reveals that reaction strength in both waves is consistently positively
correlated to population density, sectors amenable to remote work or disrupted by lockdowns, and green

party support, while being inversely related to industries requiring on-site labor.

4.6.2 Exhaustive Search

We perform an exhaustive search o

all possible variable combinations to determine which independent

variables predict reaction strength first wave and reaction strength second wave. For this analysis step, we use

the R, package olsrr

R? (for first wave analysis, see Tab

analysis, see Table

. For each subset size (1-19 variables), we select the model that maximized adjusted

e [4] for variables chosen for each variable count and for second wave

For the first wave, via this method, population density, the explanatory variable most

strongly correlated with reaction strength first wave, is chosen for every subset size, while unemployment rate,

the explanatory variable second-mos

-strongly correlated with reaction strength first wave, is chosen from a

subset size of 4 onward. Overall, apart from population density, the variables chosen in the smaller models,

mostly relate to different job sector and the necessity (or lack thereof) of on-site work: A high unemployment

rate Working in the finance sector as

well as having a higher income correlates with pursuing a white collar

job, allowing for home office and remote work more readily. Contrarily, working in agriculture, forestry, and

fisheries forces employees to work on-site. For the second wave, via this method, political variables gained

Table 5: Regression on reaction strength of second wave favors political variables. For each subset size from
1 to 19 variables, all possible combinations are evaluated through exhaustive search, and the subset with the highest

adjusted R? is selected.

4.6.3 Model Selection

We compare the following metrics across different subset sizes: R?, adjusted R?, pred R?, Mallow’s Cp, Akaike
information criteria (AIC), and Schwarz Bayesian criteria (BIC). For the first wave, the majority of selection

criteria favor the nine variable model, while for the second wave, the majority of selection criteria favor the

only variable not considered in the union but favored by the model selection criteria applied to the second

wave is 65+ year olds. We exclude 65+ year olds as it strongly correlates with average age and as we deem
them to have the same effect on reaction strength.

Figure 16: Model selection criteria for the two regressions favor the 9 (first wave) and 11 (second wave)
variable models. AIC is short for Akaike information criterion, BIC is short for Schwarz Bayesian information
criterion. BIC favoring smaller models for both regressions is to be expected as BIC penalizes each additional
parameter more strictly than AIC. Left. Model selection criteria for reaction strength first wave as regressand. Adj.
R?, pred. R? Mallow’s Cp, and AIC all favor the 9 variable model (marked with filled out circle). For each number of

reaction strength second wave as regressand. Adj. R?, pred. R? Mallow’s C,, and AIC all favor the 11 variable model

are considered.

4.6.4 Regression on Reaction Strength

We regress reaction strength first wave and reaction strength second wave on the union of variables chosen
via the model selection of the previous paragraph. During the first COVID-19 wave, unemployment rate
and population density contribute most strongly and equally to explaining variance in reaction strength
(Table|6p. Voter turnout is the only other significant (p = 0.05) explanatory variable with a positive correlation
coefficient. In contrast, agriculture, forestry, fisheries and FDP both contribute to explaining variance in

reaction strength, alas with a negative correlation coefficient.

4.7 Structural Equation Modeling Explaining Cross-district Differences in Peak Incidence

To understand which factors impact peak incidence (here defined as the 90th percentile of the peak height of

We assume

the corresponding wave), we employ a structural equation model using the R package lavaan
that reaction strength as well as the fourteen variables chosen via model selection (Section impact
peak incidence. However, as we have already shown that some of these fourteen socioeconomic variables
also impact reaction strength, reaction strength enters the structural equation model as a mediator. This
allows the computation of the total effect size of the fourteen economic variables, the sum of the direct effect
size and the indirect effect size mediated through reaction strength (see Figure [17] for total effect sizes and

Figure [6] for direct effect sizes).
