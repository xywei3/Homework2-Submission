We study a recently discovered property of many-body quantum chaotic systems called ETH-
monotonicity in two-dimensional systems. Our new results further support ETH-monotonicity in
these higher dimensional systems. We show that the flattening rate of the f-function is directly
proportional to the number of degrees of freedom in the system, so as L? where L is the linear size
of the system, and in general, expected to be L* where d is the spatial dimension of the system.
We also show that the flattening rate is directly proportional to the particle (or hole) number for

systems of same spatial size.

I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

Quantum chaos and the related topic of thermaliza-
tion in quantum many-body systems has been subjects
of intense study for the past few decades [I}3]. One of
the most important properties of many-body quantum
chaotic systems is that these systems thermalize. It is
widely believed that this is how (quantum) statistical me-
chanics arises in many-body systems. On the other hand,
integrable systems have been observed to avoid thermal-
ization experimentally as well as numerically [4] 5].

One the most important theoretical advances in this di-
rection is the discovery of eigenstate thermalization hy-
othesis (ETH) [6] [7]. In quantum mechanics, we can
keep track of only certain few-body observables which
can be easily measured or calculated. ETH gives an
ansatz of the matrix elements of such observables in the
energy eigenbasis. It has been shown to be true for vari-
ous chaotic models, see for examples [2] [814]. ETH (at
least Srednicki’s version) is motivated from Berry’s con-
jecture [2] [15]. Berry’s conjecture states that eigenstates
of quantum chaotic system is observationally equivalent
© a microcanonical ensemble. ETH statement can be
considered as Berry’s conjecture with precise definition
of the fluctuations.

Consider a non-fermionic and hermitian operator O
which represents one such observable. ETH states that
he matrix elements Om», in energy eigenbasis is [2]

(m|O|n) = Omn = O(E)5mn + lal)

m) and |n) are energy eigenstates with energy eigenval-
ues E,, and E, respectively. E = (Em + E,)/2 and
w = E,, — E, are the mean and the difference of E,,
and E,. S(E£) is the entropy at energy E. O(E) and
f(£,w) are smooth functions of their arguments. So,
O(E) is equal to the expectation value of O in the mi-
crocanonical ensemble of energy E. f(E,w) is real and
positive. Ryn are pseudo-random complex variables with
zero mean and unit variance. The operator O is hermi-
tian so

Ram = Ronny f(E, -w) = f(E,w). (2)

The relation between ETH and the second law of
thermodynamics has been explored in [16]. Interest-
ingly, the second law gives rise to a group of constraints
called ETH-monotonicity. These constraints are con-
cerned with the E-dependence of the f-function. We
will write the f-function as f(£) for a fixed w when the
w-dependence is not important. We will also work with
f(E) as a function of the effective temperature T(E) or
effective inverse temperature 8(E). With a slight abuse
of notation, we will represent these new functions as f(T)

ETH-monotonicity states that

f-function is a monotonically increasing function of the
magnitude of the effective temperature |T(E)|-

L is the linear size of the system. [16] considered the one-
dimensional XXZ spin chain with next-to-nearest neigh-
bour interaction.

In the present work, we explore ETH-monotonicity
in two-dimensional systems. We work with two differ-
ent models, viz. hard-core bosons on a two-dimensional
square lattice and two-dimensional transverse field Ising
model on a square lattice, with open boundary condition.
So, the primary task is to study the E-dependence of the
f-function and its scaling as the system size grows,
in these systems.

We found that the f-functions of the different opera-
tors are monotonically increasing function of the magni-
tude of the effective temperature |T'(E)|. We also found
that the flattening rate goes as the area A ~ L? in these
systems, where L is the linear size of the systems. So,
we expect that the flattening rate is proportional to the
volume V ~ L¢ for a d-dimensional system. Mathemati-
cally,

So, we believe that the flattening of the f(£) is partly due
o the stretching of this function as the system size grows.
But it is not a simple rescaling of the f(£) function [IG].
We still do not know the precise transformation of f(£)
as the system size increases. On the other hand, the
role of the extensive nature of E is further supported
y the observation that f(T) or f(8) does not flatten as
he system size increases, because T' or 3 are intensive
quantities.
We also found that the flattening rate goes as N+ where
N is the number of particles when the system size L¢ is
fixed.

II. MODELS AND METHOD

We will work two different many-body quantum
chaotic systems with open boundary condition. The first
one is hard-core bosons on a square lattice with near-
est neighbour interaction. This model is chaotic at high
temperature away from the edges of the energy spectrum.
Quantum chaos, thermalization and ETH in this model
has been studied in [17]. The one-dimensional version
of this model with next-to-nearest neighbour interaction
[8] [9] is also chaotic and has been the subject of intense
study for quantum chaos and ETH.

The Hamiltonian of the two-dimensional hard-core bo-
son (HCB) system under consideration is

Hy =—- >> (d1d; + b4:) +U nin; (6)

(i) (i)

(i,j) denotes all nearest-neighbour sites. The first term
is the kinetic term and the second term in the nearest-
neighbour interaction term where nj; = bb; is the occu-
pation number at site 7. The boson number is a con-
served quantity. We work in a fixed particle sector of
this Hamiltonian. We fix U = 0.1 for which the system
is chaotic.

We work with systems of size 4 x 4 sites with 4 parti-
cles and 5 x 5 sites with 5 particles to study the system
size dependence of the flattening rate. The corresponding
dimensions of the Fock spaces are 1820 and 53130 respec-
tively. To study the dependence on the particle number,
we considered the systems of size with 4x 5 sites but with
different particle numbers, viz., 4,5 and 6 bosons. The
corresponding dimensions of the Fock spaces are 4845,
15504 and 38760 respectively.

The Hamiltonian matrix is diagonalized using exact di-
agonalization. We cannot use sparse matrix techniques
because the entire Fock space is required. We considered
two observables, namely, the kinetic energy term (an ex-

tensive operator) and

the occupation number of a single

site (an intensive operator).

Om =— >> (d1d; + +040.) ,
(id)

Op. =n (7)

The single site under consideration for the different sys-
tem sizes are (2,2) in the 4 x 4 lattice, (2,3) in the 4.x 5
lattice and (3,3) in the 5 x 5 lattice. We will not be pre-
senting some of the numerical results for Og2 operator
because the numerical results are very similar to that of
Opi, operator.
We calculate the above operators in the energy eigen-
states. The matrix elements are used to calculate the
f-function following [16]. The calculations are done in
a conservative manner such that the results remain ro-
bust. For example, the choice of the microcanonical
energy window is such that, even if we use the canon-
ical entropy instead of the microcanonical entropy, the
ETH-monotonic behaviour of the f-function remains ro-
bust. Actually the use of the canonical entropy reinforces
the ETH-monotonic behaviour of the f-function. The f-
function becomes a faster monotonically increasing func-
tion of |T(E)|.

The other system we are considering is the two-
dimensional transverse field Ising model (TFIM) {13} [14].
The Hamiltonian is

i

(i,3)

The first term is the interaction term and the second term
is the longitudinal magnetic field term. This system un-
dergoes a quantum phase transition from the ferromag-
netic phase to the disordered phase as the strength of the
longitudinal magnetic field g increases. We will work in
the disordered phase with g = 4. We consider system
sizes of 3 x 4 lattice sites and 4 x 4 lattice sites. The
total spin is not a conserved quantity so we have to work
with the entire Fock space. We consider even states un-
der P,Py operation (or 180° rotation) (rg), where P,, and
Py are reflection operations about the x-axis and the y-
axis, respectively. The Fock space dimension is reduced
approximately to half. The Fock space dimension is 2050
for the 3 x 4 lattice and 32769 for the 4 x 4 lattice.

The operators to be analysed are the transverse mag-
netization operator and the total (longitudinal) magne-
tization operator, both are extensive operators.

Osi =o, Oso =\ogj (9)

Os, is one of the terms of the TFIM Hamiltonian
The one-dimensional Ising model with next-to-nearest
neighbour interaction has also been studied in [10].

Ill. RESULTS

We will first present the results for the hard-core boson
(HCB) system. We study f(E,w) for fixed w € [0.0, 5.0].
Figure{]]s hows the monotonically decreasing behaviour of
f (8) with varying ||, for different fixed values of w. So,
f(T) is a monotonically increasing function of |T|. These
plots are for the 5 x 5 lattice. For completeness, we have
also plotted f(E). The top row is for the kinetic energy
operator Ogi. The bottom row is for the occupation
number operator at a single site Ogo.

tion does not flattens as the system size increases. This
agrees with the fact that @ is an intensive quantity.

Figure la) is plots of the slope of 1/fdf/dE from
linear-fitting, with changing w for the two system sizes.
The absolute value of the slope for the larger system size
is clearly smaller. Figure |3{b) and Figure [3{c) are again
plots of the slope of 1/fdf/dE but rescaled with differ-
ent powers of the system area A. Figure 3(b) clearly
shows the slopes, scaled with A!, overlapping. So, it is
clear that the rate of flattening of f(£) is directly pro-
portional to the system size or area A. We also find that
the flattening rate of the f(E) for the occupation num-
ber Ogg is directly proportional to the system-size or
area A. So, we will not be presenting the related plots.
Similarly, we plotted the slope of 1/fdf/dE from linear-
fit, with changing w for the different boson numbers in
Figure[i[a). In this case, we are working with the system
size 4 x 5 lattice but with 4, 5, and 6 bosons. The ab-
solute value of the slope for the higher particle number
is clearly smaller. Figure [4{b) and Figure Alc) are again
plots of the slope of 1/fdf/dE but rescaled with differ-
ent powers of the boson number N. From these plots,
it is clear that the rate of flattening of f(E) is directly
proportional to the particle number N for a fixed lattice
size.

We will now present the results for the transverse field
Ising model (TFIM). Figure is the plot of the total
magnetization M, = (Ose) of the eigenstates with dif-
ferent values of the transverse magnetic field g. We will
be using g = 4 for which the total magnetization in all

the eigenstates has practically vanished. In the thermo-
dynamic limit, this quantum phase is the phase with the
Z symmetry intact [13].

Figure [6] are plots of f(£) and f(@) for the transverse
magnetization operator Og. These plots show the mono-
tonically decreasing behaviour of f(@) as a function of
Bl.

Figure |7| shows that the flattening rate of the f(E)
or the transverse magnetization operator Og, is directly
proportional to the system-size or area A.

We also find that the flattening rate of the f(E) for
he magnetization operator Ose is directly proportional
0 the system-size or area A. So, we will not be presenting
he related plots. But we present the plots of f(£) and
f(G) for the magnetization operator Og in different sys-
em sizes of 3 x 4 lattice and 4x 4 lattice, in Figure[8]| We

present these plots because we can see that some of the
peaks of f(/3) for fixed values of w are not at 8 = 0. This
deviation could lead to violation of the Kelvins statement
of the second law of thermodynamics at 6 = 0. Similar
deviation has been studied in the one-dimensional spin
chain in [16]. This unexpected result is purely due to
the very small system size that we are working with. It
can be seen from Figure |8} In the f(E£) plots, distance
of the deviated peak from a reference point (like E = 0)
remains similar even though system size increases. So,
for relatively large systems, it would be difficult to dis-
cern the deviation because EF is extensive and its range
would be very large for large systems. In the language
of inverse temperature, in the plots of f(@), we can see
that the deviated peaks are moving towards 6 = 0 as the
system size increases. For this purpose, we have kept the
range of 6 same in both the plots of f(8) in Figure |p]

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have shown that ETH-monotonicity
is present in two-dimensional systems. We found that
he flattening rate of the f(E) function goes as the area
A ~ L? in these systems, where L is the linear size of
he systems. So, we expect that the flattening rate is,
in general, proportional to the volume V ~ L#@ for a d-
dimensional system. We also show that the flattening
rate goes as N! where N is the number of particles when
the system size V is fixed.

We are considering systems with only local interac-
tions. For these systems, the energy is an extensive quan-
tity. We can see this by calculating the total range of
energy which is given by subtracting the lowest energy
eigenvalue from the largest energy eigenvalue, and di-
vide the result by the number of sites. For example, this
energy-range per site in the TFIM is 7.54 for 4 x 4 lattice
sites, and 7.30 for 3 x 4 lattice sites, even with the open
boundary condition that we have used. Periodic bound-
ary condition would make these numbers even closer. So,
as we have mentioned in section []] , we believe that the
flattening of the f(£) is due to the stretching of this func-
ion as the system size grows. But simple rescaling of
che f-function with appropriate power of the system size
does not give the correct f(£) for different system sizes.
Even taking into account the stretching in w-direction
does not reproduce a simple scaling transformation of f-
function as the system size grows. So, it appears that
he flattening of the f-function is a more complicated
ransformation of the f-function in the E —w plane. In
future, we plan to further study the properties of this
ransformation.
