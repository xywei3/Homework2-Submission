ABSTRACT

Context. Current exoplanet surveys are focused on detecting small exoplanets orbiting in the liquid-water habitable zones of their host
stars. Despite the recent significant advancements in instrumental developments, the current limitation in detecting these exoplanets
is the intrinsic variability of the host star itself.

Aims. Our aim is to use the full CARMENES guaranteed time observations (GTO) data set spanning more than 8 years of observations
of over 350 stars to investigate the wavelength dependence of high-precision radial velocities (RV), as stellar activity features should
exhibit a wavelength dependence while the RV variation due to an orbiting planet will be wavelength independent.

Methods. We use the chromatic index (CRX) to quantify the slope of the measured RVs as a function of logarithmic wavelength. We
investigate the dependence of the CRX in the full Carmenes GTO sample on 24 stellar activity indices in the visible and near-infrared
channels of the CARMENES spectrograph and each star’s stellar parameters. We also present an updated convective turnover time
scaling for the calculation of the stellar Rossby number for M dwarfs.
Results. Our results show that approximately 17% of GTO stars show a strong or a moderate correlation between CRX and RV. We
can improve the measured RVs by a factor of up to nearly 4 in rms by subtracting the RV predicted by the CRX-RV correlation from
the measured RVs. Mid M dwarfs with moderate rotational velocities, moderate CRX-gradients and quasi-stable activity features have
the best rms improvement factors.
Conclusions. We conclude that the CRX is a powerful diagnostic in mitigation of stellar activity and the search for low mass rocky
planets.

rocky exoplanets orbiting in the liquid-water habitable zones

In recent years there has been exceptional progress in wave- of their host stars using the RV technique. These include

length calibration and the development of high-precision, ESPRESSO (Pepe et al J2021), EXPRES (Jurgenson et al. 2016)

and MAROON-X (Bean|2020) among others with tens of cm s~!
precision. Recently,|Suarez Mascarefio et al. (2020) reported the
achievement of a precision of 30 cm s~' for ESPRESSO obser-
vations of Proxima Centauri. The current limitation in detecting
small rocky planets is not instrumental capability, but the intrin-
sic variability of the host stars themselves (see recent works such
as|Crass et al.[2021} [Zhao et al.[2022| and references therein).
All stars with masses just above and lower than the Sun pos-
sess an internal convection zone and exhibit some degree of mag-
netic activity from very low (e.g. the early M dwarf GJ pies
to very high (e.g. the early and mid M dwarfs
AU Mic and EV Lac: |Cale et al./[2021} [Klein et al.|/2022} \Jef-|
fers et al.[2022} [Bellotti et al./2022). The presence of this ac-
tivity induces an asymmetry in the shape of the stellar photo-
spheric absorption lines which limits our ability to determine the
star’s centre-of-mass motion via the position of the line’s cen-
tre (Dravins et al.]1981}|Saar & Donahue} 1997}|Lagrange et al.
Meunier et al.[2010) [Reiners et al.J2010} [Bares et al.
2014). This con-

sequently results in an additional activity-induced RV contribu-
tion which impacts the detection and the measurement of the
masses of small planets orbiting close to their host stars. There
are also a large number of methods that have been developed
to remove the activity-induced component to the RVs. However,
the conclusion is, from the extensive testing of different activity-
removal methods gg SE ie | that no method succeeds
in routinely achieving a reduction in the RV rms to sub-meter-
per-second levels.

In this work we aim to understand the wavelength depen-
dent activity diagnostics of the full data set secured as part of the
CARMENES GTO survey (Calar Alto high-Resolution search
for M dwarfs with Exo-earths with Near-infrared and optical
Echelle Spectrographs; |Quirrenbach et al.| (2018 2020). The
CARMENES GTO sample was selected to contain the brightest
stars in the J band for each M dwarf sub-spectral type bin that are
observable from Calar Alto Observatory in southern Spain and
have no stellar companion within 5 arcsec. This selection pro-
cedure for the GTO sample ensures that it includes both mag-
netically active and inactive stars, and now after over 8 years
of operation, and with more than 20000 spectra in hand
{et al. [2023), ensures that we have a statistically significant sam-
ple to understand the impact of stellar activity on high-precision
RV measurements. One important diagnostic parameter in the
search for exoplanets orbiting stars showing stellar activity is an
analysis of the wavelength dependence of the measured RV val-
ues. This is because features of stellar activity such as dark cool
starspots are typically wavelength-dependent because the con-
trast between starspots and the stellar photosphere is smaller at
longer wavelengths. In contrast, the RV signal from an orbiting
exoplanet is wavelength independent.

The chromatic index (CRX) is a measure of the RV varia-
tion as a function of wavelength. It is defined by taking the slope
of the RVs in every spectral order as a function of logarithmic
wavelength (Zechmeister et al./2018). The CRX-index has been
shown by Jeffers et al.}(2022), using a low-resolution Doppler-
imaging technique, to be directly correlated with starspot cover-
age for the mid M-dwarf EV Lac. This is consistent with (i) the
simulations of (2020), who combined the CRX-
index with photometric observations of YZ CMi to constrain the
spot-filling factor and YZ CMi’s spot and photosphere tempera-
ture contrast, and (ii) the previous work of [Tal-Or et al-] (2018),
who investigated the CRX-index for only the most active stars
in the CARMENES GTO sample using the first 1.5 years of

CARMENES data. More recently, |Lafarga et al.) (2020) inves-

tigated periodicities found in RVs and nine activity indicators in
the CARMENES GTO sample. They concluded that the CRX is

as efficient as the line bisector (Queloz et al.|/2001) as indica-
tor of activity for active M dwarfs. Other recent work by|Collier|

Cameron et al. (2021) (and also|Lisogorskyi et Eu has ex-
ploited the wavelength dependence of RV induced by stellar ac-
tivity to separate RVs with dynamical origin from stellar activity
induced variability.

In this paper we aim to empirically understand the wave-
length variations of RVs using the CRX-index, and to quantify
how to remove this contribution from the RVs. In Section 2 we
define the CRX-index and in Section 3 we describe the obser-
vations and define how the CRX stars were selected from the
full CARMENES GTO sample. Section 4 we investigate the de-
pendence of CRX-index on fundamental stellar parameters. In
Section 5, we use the wavelength information contained in the
CRX-index to remove stellar activity from the RVs. We discuss
the implications of our results in Section 6.

2. CRX: dependence of RVs with wavelength
2.1. Definition of the CRX
The CRX-index is defined as the slope of the RV as a function

of logarithmic wavelength (Zechmeister et al.|[2018)
spectrum. The RV of each spectrum is computed using weighted
averages to account for the wavelength dependence of the RVs
(more details later in Section 3.1). This is illustrated in Figure(I}
which shows the wavelength dependent RVs of 10 spectra o
the mid-M dwarf EV Lac. The spectrum exhibiting the steepest
positive gradient is illustrated with red points and a linear fit in
green. The RV value computed by serval is shown as a hori-
zontal purple line.

Figure [2] shows the CRX calculation in more detail for
the same 10 spectra that are illustrated in Figure in Because
the spectra span less than two complete rotations of EV Lac
(Prot = 4.349 d; Jeffers et al-[2022), the effects of evolution due
to stellar activity should be minimal. Each spectrum is coloured
according to the stellar rotation phase. The CRX-index measured
for each of the spectra in Figure [2] (top left panel) is shown as a
function of RV in Figure 2] (top right panel), where the colour
coding is the same in both panels.

Fig. 2. Illustration of the behaviour of the CARMENES visible channel CRX for the mid-M dwarf EV Lac. Top Left: Variation of RV as a function
of wavelength (spacing is logarithmic). The CRX-index is the slope of RV vs log(A) for each spectrum. A total of 10 CARMENES spectra are
shown covering approximately one stellar rotation. The upper and lower boundaries are the fits to the most positive and negative RV values. Top
right: The CRX-gradient, illustrating the CRX-index as a function of mean RV. Bottom Left and Bottom Right: CRX vs rotation phase and RV vs
rotation phase illustrating the anti-correlation of CRX-index (i.e. the negative CRX-gradient shown in the top right panel). The plotted points in

each panel are colour coded according to stellar rotation phase.

The gradient of the CRX-index versus RV distribution for a
series of spectra is referred to as the CRX-gradient in the work
that follows. For each star, we define the CRX-length as RVmax
- RVmin, Where the RVmin and the RVmax are the minimum and
maximum RV values from all of the available spectra (using 90
and 10 percentiles). We prefer this definition since CRX vari-
ation (CRXmax - CRXmin) and CRX are directly related, while
CRX-length is most readily calculated directly from the RVs,
even in the absence of CRX-index measurements. The large vari-
ations in the CRX-index as a function of rotation phase (as illus-
trated in Figure[2) demonstrate how the CRX-index evolves over
the stellar rotation period due to the presence of activity features
on the stellar surface. The CRX-index for each individual spec-
trum, and consequently the CRX-gradient for a series of spectra,
has been directly linked to the distribution of dark starspots on
the stellar surface using low resolution Doppler imaging tech-
niques by [Jeffers et al.](2022). The lower two panels of Figure
show the variation of CRX-index and RV as a function of stellar
rotational phase, with the same colouring as in the upper panels.

The data shown in Figure [2] are for the VIS channel only
as the errors in the NIR channel are too high for meaningful
interpretation for the case of EV Lac. Even though the NIR data
are not shown, we do not expect to see a convergence of the
slopes at longer wavelengths as is suggested by the outer edges
of the light grey region in Figure[2|(top left panel). As discussed
), a black-body scaling of the spot and

by

photospheric flux ratios will remain constant continuing to NIR
wavelengths, in agreement with PHOENIX models for the spot
/ photosphere ratio. A more detailed description of the full data

set of EV Lac was previously presented by (2022

2.2. Comparison of the CRX with different instruments

The CRX will show different behaviour when investigated with
different spectrographs with varying wavelength coverage and
spectral resolution. The comparison of the CRX between data
secured with HARPS and CARMENES has been previously in-

vestigated by (2018) for the stars YZ CMi,
and GJ 3379, and for AD Leo. In
general the CRX shows a negative slope for both HARPS and
CARMENES datasets of YZ CMi while for GJ 3379, only the
CARMENES data show a significant chromatic variation. Simi-
eae CARMENES M dwarf K2-18 has been reported by|Radica|
to show chromatic behaviour at a level that is be-
ioe our threshold of Pearson’s r > 0.5. Similar to GJ 3379, this
is not visible in the HARPS dataset of K2-18. Surprisingly, the
CRX of AD Leo shows a positive slope for archival HARPS data

and a negative slope for CARMENES data (Kossakowski et al.
[2022}[Zechmeister et al.[2018) and significantly lower amplitude
for much redder wavelengths (Carmona et al.]2023). The com-

parison of chromaticity of RVs across a very broad wavelength
regimes has the potential to give a crucial insight into the activ-
ity of these stars. However, simultaneous observations across a
broad wavelength range are required to truly compare the wave-
length dependence as features of stellar activity can evolve on
timescales of a few stellar rotation periods.

2.3. Modelling the CRX

The effect of dark starspots on the wavelength dependence of
RVs has previously been investigated by (2007);
[Bames et al, (2011); (2021) among many

others. In particular, the CRX has been simulated by

A&A proofs: manuscript no. CRX_main_ALL

fet al] (2020) using spectroscopic and photometric data for the
mid-M dwarf YZ CMi. They demonstrated that the CRX-index,
computed for each spectrum, can be used to determine, and
break the degeneracy between, the spot-filling factor and temper-
ature contrast between the starspot and unspotted photosphere.
Recent work has shown that the CRX-index versus RV re-
lation can have an inclined lemniscate (00) or figure-of-eight
shape, with a typically negative slope, which results from a slight
phase offset between the phase curves of the RVs and the CRX
values (examples include|Baroch et al.[2020} Jeffers et al.[2022}
for YZ CMi and EV Lac respectively). This is comparable to

the inclined-lemniscate shape established for RV versus Bisector

Inverse Slope (BIS) relations for co-rotating cool spots

let al. [2007 1997} [Boisse et al.|2011). For the
BIS, (2011) attribute this to result from foreshorten-

ing and limb-darkening effects, while for the CRX|Baroch et al.
consider that the offset results from the combined effects
of limb darkening and convective blue shift. The example of the
CRX-index versus RV relation shown Figure 2 for the mid-M
dwarf EV Lac is almost a straight line due to the dominance of
high-latitude spot features (see the surface brightness maps re-
constructed by [Jeffers et al-|(2022)) and to the limited time sam-
pling of the data which covers only a few rotation periods. We
would expect a higher amplitude lemniscate shape if there was a
higher degree of spot coverage located at equatorial latitudes as
has been modelled for the BIS (Boisse et al.[2011)

2.3.1. Spot to photosphere contrast

The spot to photospheric temperature contrast decreases towards
redder wavelengths because the contrast between dark starspot
and the photosphere is smaller at longer wavelengths. As this
is one of the key diagnostic parameters of the CRX, we first
update the temperature contrast relation originally published by
who only used contrasts derived from photo-
metric data sets for spectral types earlier than M3V. Here, we ad-
ditionally include values used in Doppler imaging studies cover-
ing the full spectral type range from early-G to late-M (Table[Ip,
as well as the MHD simulations of starspots for different spectral
types (Panja et al./2020). Our revised spot to photosphere tem-
perature contrast (using Doppler Imaging results only) is equated
as follows:

AT = aT pho +b (1)
where a = 0.47 and b = —926.97K. The fit to all Doppler
Imaging data is plotted in Figure[3]

2.3.2. CRX-gradient and length

The simulations of (2020) show that the gradient
of the CRX-RV relation is an important diagnostic as it provides

a key insight into how quickly the RV variations induced by a
cool starspot decrease as a function of increasing (logarithmic)
wavelength. In the simulations o (2020), the CRX-
gradient primarily depends on the spot to photosphere temper-
ature contrast ratio for the case of one large spot located at a

latitude of 78°. In addition to the CRX-gradient, [Baroch et al]

also reported that the length of the CRX-index versus RV
relation depends on both the spot-to-photosphere contrast and
the spot filling factor. This is expected because for a given sin-
gle spot size (i.e. a star with a fixed filling factor), the wave-
length dependent RV amplitude and hence gradient measured by

CRX-index is larger for a larger spot-to-photosphere contrast.
Similarly, for a fixed spot to photospheric contrast, increasing
a spot’s size, and thus the spot filling factor, will also lead to a
greater CRX-length.

The models of (2020) considered the impact

of one starspot located at high latitudes on the surface of the
mid-M dwarf YZ CMi. However results from Doppler imaging
studies (examples are listed in Table[I) show that in reality, the
surfaces of M dwarfs are likely to be much more densely spot-
ted. In this work we use the CRX-gradient and the CRX-length
as the two main diagnostic parameters of our investigation. We
investigate how the CRX-gradient and CRX-length of stars in the
CARMENES GTO sample depend on their fundamental stellar
parameters and levels of stellar activity.

3. Data
3.1. Observations and data processing

The data investigated in this work are the full set of CARMENES
Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) of more than 350 M
dwarfs which have been observed since the start of the

shaded grey bars.

CARMENES GTO survey in 2016. The CARMENES spectro-
graph is installed at the 3.5m telescope at Calar Alto Obser-
vatory in Spain. It comprises two fibre-fed and cross-dispersed
spectrographs, one at visible wavelengths (VIS, 520-960 nm)
and the other at near-infrared wavelengths (NIR, 960-1710 nm)
with a resolution of ~94 600 in the VIS and ~80400 in NIR
and an average sampling of 2.8 pixels (Quirrenbach et al. [2018).
The data were processed in the usual manner for CARMENES
data, i.e. with caracal (CARMENES reduction and calibration

the RVs were calculated using serval (Spectrum radial veloc-

ity analyzer{Zechmeister et al.|2018) using weighted averages to

account for the wavelength dependence of the RVs, where the

individual orders are weighted. The impact of telluric lines on

the measured RVs was removed
template division telluric modeling technique. The nightly-zero-
point (NZPs) were also subtracted from the serval RV measure-
ments (see [Ribas et al.| section 4.4 for a detailed explana-
tion).

3.2. CARMENES NIR channel

In this work we only use data from the CARMENES VIS chan-
nel and not from the CARMENES NIR channel because the
NIR channel yields RV measurements of less precision than the
VIS channel. This is partly because of the diminished RV in-
formation content in the observed NIR domain
(2018). But also, the CARMENES NIR channel suffered from
thermo-mechanical instability since the start of operations and
until some corrective measures were applied a few years later.
Consequently, the NIR RV data were in general not used dur-
ing the exploitation of Guaranteed Time Observations (but see
strument upgrades have dramatically improved the precision of
the NIR channel (Schaefer et al. 2024; Varas et al. 2024, in prep)
and a careful analysis of the newly collected NIR data is under-

going

3.3. Activity Indices and CCF parameters

Given the large wavelength coverage of CARMENES we have
a large number of activity indicators available. We use a total of
26 indicators as follows

3.4. CRX-all sample

From the full CAMRENES GTO sample of 350 stars, firstly,
we select stars with a minimum number of observations Nops >
25 as this is the minimum number of observations required
to give a reliable CRX-index versus RV relation, and to pro-
vide a statistically significant correlation with activity indica-
tors. The CARMENES GTO sample with No»; > 25 com-
prises a total of 215 stars and is referred to as CARMENES
Neto25 sample in the rest of this work. Parameters for all 215
CARMENES No7025 stars are listed in Table B.1 (Appendix).

We then computed the statistical significance of the corre-
lation of CRX-index with RV for each of the 215 stars using
Pearson’s r coefficient. We define a strong correlation (or anti-
correlation) where Pearson’s r > |0.7| , and a moderate correla-
tion to be 0.5 < |r| < 0.7 . The statistical significance is com-
puted by the Student’s t-test probability value, p. We assumed
values of p < 0.03 imply no strong evidence to reject the (no
correlation) null hypothesis. There are a total of 39 stars with a
strong or a moderate correlation and these stars are referred to
as CRX-all in the work that follows and are listed in Table[A.1]
From this, 21 stars have strong correlations between the CRX-
index and RV and 18 stars have a moderate correlation.

3.5. CRX-slope sample

The CRX-all sample is further classified based on a visual in-
spection of the CRX-index versus RV relation for each star. A
total of 13 stars exhibit a tight linear CRX-index versus RV rela-
tionship and comprise both strong and moderate statistical CRX-
index versus RV correlations. This sample is referred to as the
CRX-slope sample in the rest of this work. To avoid confusion
we refer to the actual measured value of the CRX slope as the
CRX-gradient in the rest of this work. The CRX-index versus
RV relation is shown for each of these stars in Figure[A-T]

3.6. CRX-Pearson sample

The 26 remaining stars are refereed to as the CRX-Pearson
sample in the rest of this work and are subdivided into Pearson-
strong sample comprising 9 stars and Pearson-moderate sample
comprising 17 stars. The CRX-index versus RV for these two
samples are respectively shown in Sey and
RV-CRX correlation deviates from a straight line in this sample,
where the deviations can take the form of a high degree of
scatter or a generally extended cloud shape. The reasons for
these deviations are not well understood and are beyond the
current scope of this work.

Sample Summary:

- CRX-all: 39 stars with Pearson’s strong, |r| > 0.7 (21 stars),
or moderate, 0.5 < |r| < 0.7 (18 stars) correlations
Jeffers et al.: Wavelength dependence of radial velocity measurements

- CRX-slope: 13 stars with a tight linear relationship, as in-
spected visually; they are a subset of the the CRX-all sample

— CRX-Pearson: 26 stars with non-linear but moderate (17
stars) or strong (9 stars) Pearson’s r values

3.7. Comparison to the CARMENES Nero25-sample

The distribution of the CRX-all stars compared to the
CARMENES Noer1o025-sample in terms of spectral type and pro-
jected stellar rotational velocity, or vsini is shown in Fig-
ure [4] The 39 stars in the CRX-all sample cover all spectral
types and broadly follows the spectral type distribution of the
CARMENES Noe71o025-sample. The distribution of v sini values
for the CRX-all stars and the CARMENES Ng7o25-sample are
shown in Figure [4] (right panel). Approximately one third of the
CRX-all stars have vsini values < 2.0kms~', one third have
vsini values between 2.0-4.0 kms~! and the remaining third
have values 4.0-10.5 kms~!. The wavelength dependence of the
RVs depends on many fundamental stellar parameters and in the
following sections we will investigate the correlations and trends
in the activity indices available from the CARMENES spectra.

4. Results: CRX: gradient and length

As previously discussed, preliminary models indicate that the
two most useful parameters to characterise the CRX-index ver-
sus RV relation are its gradient and length. For the CRX-slope
sample, the measured CRX-gradient values typically have slopes
ranging from —2.65 Np~! to —3.70 Np! (8 stars), with 4 stars
having slopes in the range —4.6 Np~! to —17 Np~!, and 1 star
having a very shallow slope of —1.16 Np~!. The colouring of
points in Figure [6] and subsequent Figures is chosen to reflect
these broad groupings. We caution the direct interpretation of
the steepest slopes for the 3 stars with the latest M-dwarf spec-
tral types as for these stars there is less flux in the bluer orders
and may potentially bias the results. Since our aim is to apply
uniform analysis to all stars we have included these stars but do
not draw any conclusions from them. In contrast, the steep slope
of the young M 3.0 dwarf K2-33 results from very high levels of
stellar activity given its young age.

CRX-length values range from 30 ms~! also for the M 2.5
dwarf TYC 3529-1437-1 to 2897 ms~! for the M 3.0 dwarf K2-
33. The distribution of CRX-length values for the CRX-all sam-
ple compared to the CARMENES GTO sample is shown in Fig-
ure[5] In the work that follows we normalise the CRX-length by
dividing the measured length by the stellar v sini.

Furthermore, in Figure {| we show the CRX variation,
CRXiax -—CRXmin, aS a function of the total RV variation,
RVmax—RVmin, Which we define as the CRX-length. The
CRX-slope stars with moderate gradients show a linear increase
with increasing RV variation.

Figure [/]illustrates the correlation between the CRX-length
and the Pearson’s r value where longer CRX-length / v sini val-
ues have a higher Pearson’s r value indicating a stronger sta-
tistical correlation. We note that low CRX-length values occur
at low vsini values. There was no correlation noted between
the CRX-gradient and the Pearson’s r value. We further inves-
tigated the correlation of CRX-gradient with the CRX-length.
We find no correlation between these two parameters (plots not
shown). We also examined the dependence of the CRX-gradient
on the inferred spot to photospheric temperature contrast (see
Section 2.2.1). While the results do not show a correlation with
CRX-gradient, the CRX-slope stars lower contrasts for stars with

higher CRX-length / vsini values as shown in the middle panel
of Figure [7] Stars with low vsini values show the lowest CRX-
length / vsini values over a range of medium to high contrasts.
Increasing the vsini value for a given contrast often results in a
higher CRX-length / vsini value. The lower panel of Figure [7]
shows that there is a tendency of stars with short stellar rotation
periods to show slightly higher CRX-length / v sini values.

Our initial results indicate that the interpretation and under-
standing the nature of the CRX is more challenging than sug-
gested by the models (Baroch et al.|[2020). However, it should
be noted that only one starspot was modelled on the surface of
YZ CMi and the reality is certainly more complicated. M dwarfs
in general are likely to have more complicated distributions of
starspots, where the latitude of the starspot will also have an im-
pact on the CRX-gradient and length (Barnes et al.J2011), as well
that M dwarfs typically have much lower levels of convective
blueshift compared to the more massive G and K dwarfs, its im-
pact on the RV precision is unlikely to be a large effect
et al./2021) compared to more massive solar-type stars. The de-
pendence of the CRX gradient and length as a function of stellar
activity parameters will be investigated in later sections of this
work.

4.1. Dependence on activity indicators

In this section we investigate how the CRX gradient and CRX-
length of each of the 13 CRX-slope stars depend on their
measured activity indices in relation to the CRX-Pearson and
CARMENES Noe1o025-samples. The general patterns of activity
in the CARMENES GTO sample have previously been presented
and discussed in detail by(Jeffers et al.|(2018).

In the following Figures [8]to[13} the stars in the CRX-slope
sample are shown as diamond symbols, CRX-Pearson strong
stars with an asterisk symbol, CRX-Pearson moderate stars as
a cross, and the remaining stars in the CARMENES Ner1o025-
sample are shown as small grey circular points. For each figure,
the left and right panels are colour-coded based on the CRX gra-
dient and the CRX-length / v sini, respectively.

The colouring for the CRX gradient and the CRX-length
plots were chosen to represent the sample in terms of global
groups rather specific stars. In the text that follows we discuss
these plots in terms of the shallowest to the steepest slopes, and
the shortest to the longest CRX-length values. The stellar activ-
ity indices that we investigate are stellar (i) rotational velocity or
vsini (Figure[8) (ii) chromospheric emission via Ha (Figure[9),
(iii) diagnostic of spot coverage via Ti07050 A band (Figure [11 ig
and finally (iv) average magnetic field strength (Figure[13p.

4.2. CRX-gradient

In Table[2]we have summarised the information contained in the
left-hand panels of Figures to[I3}to understand how the CRX
gradient varies as a function of a range of stellar activity param-
eters. Comparing the gradients of the CRX-slope sample with
the full CARMENES Ng7o25-sample (see (2018),
we conclude that the stars with the shallowest CRX-gradients
are among the least active stars. Since there is only one star in
this category we do not include the shallowest slopes in Table[2|
Stars with moderate CRX gradients occur at early to mid-M
spectral types, have high levels of stellar activity (Figures [8] [)
and show saturated log(Lyo/Lpo) and average magnetic field
strengths (Figures [0] [13). Similarly, the steepest slopes occur

erate Ha activity levels, with early to mid-M spectral types and
moderate average magnetic field strengths (Figures [8] [9] [13).
The moderate CRX-length values occur for very active stars and
the longest lengths are for very active stars at late M spectral
types. As noted in for the CRX gradient, activity in the latest M
dwarfs saturates at lower log(Lyq/Lpo1) values compared to mid

M dwarfs (Figures[10][13).

4.4. CRX-Pearson

The remaining stars in the CRX-Pearson sample follow the same
trends. Stars with a strong Peason’s correlation typically have
longer lengths and are located at mid to late M spectral types.
The correlation of the CRX-length with various parameters was
previously discussed in more detail in Section 3.

4.5. Noteworthy points

Our aim has been to present the results of the CRX-gradient and
length in the context of stellar activity in a clear and concise
manner. In addition to the points already discussed, there are a
few additional noteworthy points

- Can H&K: We also investigated the dependence of the CRX
on the Ca n H&K lines as derived for the CARMENES GTO
sample by|Perdelwitz et al. (2021). However, there were only
a few measurements available for the stars in the CRX-all
sample from archival observations and it was not possible to
determine any distinct correlations or trends; therefore these
plots are not shown.

—- X-ray: As summarised in Tables |2| and [3] X-ray data were
only available for a small number of stars and it was not pos-
sible to derive any trends or correlations. As part of determin-
ing the log(Lx/Lpo1) relation as a function of Rossby number,
we noticed that the fit parameters provided by [Wright et al]
in their equations 5 and 6 contain typos and are not
the values derived from fitting the data in their Table 3. No-
tably, (2022) independently found that there
was an offset with the log values from{Wright et al-|(2018)

for very low mass stars. The correct scaling for the empirical

calibration data of [Wright et al.| (2018) is as follows (and is

an update to their Equations 5 and 6):

logt = (0.58 + 0.04) + (0.28 + 0.01)(V — Ks) (2)

logt = (2.30 + 0.06) — (1.38 + 0.245)(M/Mg)

(3)

+(0.22 + 0.19)(M/Mo)”
where log t is the convective turnover time and (V — Ks) is
the magnitude difference between the V and Ks bands. The
difference in the Rossby numbers derived using the fit param-

eters directly taken from|Wright et al.|(2018) and Equation[2

is illustrated in Figure[12]for the CARMENES GTO sample.

4.6. Stars not showing CRX-gradient

To understand why some stars show a clear CRX slope, or have
a Statistically significant correlation between CRX and RV, and
other stars not, we inspected the CRX-index versus RV relations
of seven stars that are not part of the CRX-all sample. These stars

were selected from regions that did not contain any stars from
the CRX-all sample in (i) the v sini versus spectral type and (ii)
the Ha versus spectral type plots. The stars are listed in Table [4]
and their CRX-index versus RV relations are shown in Appendix
The two stars, Teegarden’s star and K2-18 are exoplanet

sts Gane Seis etal POT Pavchan etal]
Martioli et al.]2021}|Wittrock et al.2022} |Dreizler et al.
(2024). For both Teegarden’s star and K2-18, the planet-induced
RV amplitude is a large fraction of the CRX-length value. In
particular, K2-18 has been reported by (2022) to
exhibit a wavelength dependence in RV based on the line-by-

line method, but this below the Pearson’s r threshold of 0.5 that
we consider in this work.

5. Results: Removing stellar activity from RVs
using CRX

The RV signatures resulting from presence of stellar activity
such as spots and plage regions is wavelength dependent, due to
the decrease of the photospheric / spot contrast, whereas a plan-
etary companion would induce a RV signal that is wavelength
independent. In this section we use the wavelength dependent in-
formation parameterised by the CRX to remove the signatures of
stellar activity from the CRX-all sample of 39 stars. The subtrac-
tion of the CRX, via a linear fit to the CRX-RV anti-correlation,
from the RV results in a decrease in the RV rms by a factor of
up to 3.89 in the case of IRXS JO50156.7+4233 (labeled: IRX).
The results for the CRX-all sample are listed in Table We
find a total of 9 stars or 25% of the CRX-all sample have a factor
of improvement greater than 2.0.

There is a strong dependence of the factor of improvement
(Fol) with Pearson’s r value as shown in the top left-hand panel
of Figure[14] A linear fit shows that this relation can be equated
as follows:

Fol = —18.51r— 14.48
Fol = —1.98r + 0.04

(r < —0.80)

(r > —0.80) a

where Fol is the factor of improvement and r is the Pearson’s
r value. Only 3 stars show an RV rms reduction that is greater
than a factor of 3. These are 1RXS JO50156.7+010845, YZ CMi
and EV Lac, which will be referred to as the RVorr3 stars in the
rest of this work. All three stars have mid-M spectral types and
are located on the saturated part of the rotation-activity correla-
tion (Figure[10). For mid-M spectral types, this occurs at higher
normalised Ha values than for the latest M dwarf spectral types.

The correlation of the Factor of Improvement with stellar ro-
tation period is shown in Figure[14](upper right panel). The high-
est Factor of Improvement values are shown for fast to moder-
ately rotating stars with rotation periods of approximately a few
days to just less than 10 days. This is likely because such mod-
erately rotating stars have more stable spot patterns.

The TiO indicator can be considered as an indicator of dark
starspot coverage, even on slowly rotating and less active stars
[Vogt] 1979);|Amado & Zboril te | O’Neal et al. 2004). To
remove the spectral type dependence that we previously showed
in Figure[I 1] we plot the maximum minus the minimum value for
each star (Figure [[4] middle left panel). The RV corr3stars show
moderate values, while the cluster of low usini stars with very
small Factor of Improvement values show very small TiO 7050
variations.

rived using the fit in Seaweed the parameters published in

mass following {Shan et al. (2024).

Furthermore, we show the factor of improvement as a func-
tion of normalised Ha in Figure[14](middle row right panel). No-
tably, the RV corr3 stars have very high levels of Ha activity. The
remaining stars show Ha values spanning the full range from
low to high levels of Ha activity.

Finally in the lower panels of Figure [14] we investigate the
dependence of the Factor of Improvement value on the CRX-
length / vsini and spot contrast ratio (left and right panels re-
spectively). The factor of improvement increases with increas-
ing CRX-length / vsini values, though importantly the RV orr3
stars don’t follow this trend with the highest factor of improve-
ment values and moderate CRX-length / v sini values. The low-
est v sini stars have the lowest factor of improvement values and
the lowest CRX-length / vsini measurements. The variation of
the factor of improvement with spot contrast ratio shows a gen-
eral trend of increasing factor of improvement values with de-
creasing spot contrast ratios. The highest factor of improvement
values occurring for moderate spot coverage ratios that are typi-
cal for mid-M spectral types.

6. Discussion

The advantage of the CARMENES spectrograph is its large
wavelength coverage and high RV precision. In this work we
have investigated the wavelength dependence of RVs for the

. CRX-RV relations for each of these stars are plotted in Figure[A.4]

CARMENES Ne1025 sample of 215 stars. In this section we
discuss our results.

6.1. CRX-gradient and CRX-length as a function of stellar
parameters

Our results show that from the CARMENES No71025 sample of
215 stars that 39 stars show a strong or a moderate correlation
between the CRX and the RV (CRX-all stars). Furthermore, a
subset of 13 of these stars show a tight linear relationship (CRX-
slope stars).

We demonstrate that the larger the variation is in CRX-length
/vsini the larger the variation is in CRX (i.e.ACRX). The high-
est variations in CRX-length and CRX tend to occur for the least
massive stars with the steepest CRX-gradients where their activ-
ity levels are saturated. The caveat with this is that these stars
have very little flux at bluer wavelenghts and may be biased.
However, the very active star K2-22 also shows a very steep
slope but has a spectral type of M 3.0 V. This shows that our
methods can detect a CRX-RV correlation even for more rapidly
rotating stars with high levels of stellar activity.

There is also a strong dependence of the CRX-length / v sini
on the Pearson’s r value with the slowest rotating stars having
the lowest CRX-length / v sini values and at most moderate Pear-
son’s r values for the CRX-RV relation. This is in agreement with
the previous work of [Tal-Or et al. (2018). There is also a corre-
lation of the CRX-length / v sini with spot to photosphere tem-
perature contrasts where stars with lower contrasts (e.g. at late
M spectral types) show higher CRX-length /v sini values. While
these results are valid for our sample of stars, a true determina-
tion of the inter-dependency between CRX-length /v sini and the
stellar spot to photosphere temperature contrast is only possible
knowing the distribution and evolution of spots and other fea-
tures of stellar activity on the stellar surface. As noted by[Barnes|
fet al] (20TI), the latitude of a starspot (or other activity signa-
ture) will impact the activity induced RV, with higher latitude
spots having a lower RV than equatorial spots. Similarly, the lat-
itude of spots will impact the lemniscate shape

. We already know from our extensive investigation of stel-
lar activity the CARMENES consortium, that every M dwarf is
an individual when it comes to its activity patterns and evolution
timescales.

(right panel). The minimum v sini value plotted is 2 kms~!. The stars are labelled as indicated in Table!

6.1.1. Dependence of CRX-gradient on stellar activity

Since there is only one star with a classification of having a shal-
low CRX-gradient, we restrict the discussion of our results to the
stars with moderate and steep slopes. The stars in the CRX-slope
sample with moderate CRX-gradients cover a range in spectral
type from early-M to mid M as indicated by the navy points in
Figures [8] to 3| These stars are active stars as evidenced by:
(i) higher vsin7 values of up to 5 kms~! for stars with early-M
spectral types and a range of vsini values from 2 to 11 kms~! at
mid-M spectral types (Figure|8), (ii) a range in rotation periods
from 1 to 11 days, (iii) the highest log(Ly/Lpo1) values (Fig-

in the CRX-all sample of 39 stars (iv) located in the upper
part of the log(LyHa/Lpo1) as a function of v sini (Figure[10p, (v)
lowest TiO7050 values per spectral type bin (Figure [IT), (vi)
saturation in X-rays (not shown), (vi) highest average magnetic
field strengths as a function of spectral type and vsini (Fig-
ure [13] upper and lower panels respectively). They also have,
for our M-dwarf sample, comparatively high to moderate AT
spot/photosphere temperature contrasts.

There are only a few stars with high CRX-gradient values
and the latest spectral types of the CRX-slope sample. Despite
their high-CRX-gradients, these stars exhibit moderate levels of
activity (i) they have moderate to high v sini levels (Figure[8p, (ii)
are the most Ha active stars in the CARMENES Ngro25-sample
for the latest spectral types (Figure[9), (iii) are located in the ac-
tive part of the log(Lyo/Lpo1) as a function of v sini (Figure[10),
(iv) are located in the ‘hook’ part of the TiO7050 per spectral

type bin (Figure (Up. (v) show moderate average magnetic field
strengths as a function of spectral type and vsini (Figure
upper and lower panels respectively). Their moderate activity is
because late-M dwarfs saturate at lower activity levels compared

to early- and mid-M dwarfs (for more details see |Mohanty &'

[Basrif2003). These stars have the smallest AT spot/photosphere

temperature contrasts and previously explained, we advise cau-
tion in the literal interpretation of these steep slopes as they may
be biased due to the lack of flux at blue orders compared to the
rest of the sample.

6.1.2. Dependence of CRX-length on stellar activity

The stars with the shortest CRX-length values have mid-M spec-
tral types and show low to moderate levels of stellar activity as
evidenced by (i) their low v sini values (Figure[8} and a range of
moderate rotation periods (Figure|7| (ii) are the least Ha active
stars (Figure >). (iii) are located in the unsaturated part of the
rotation-activity relation (Figure [FOp. (iv) have low to moderate
average magnetic field strengths and are located on the unsat-
urated part of the magnetic field - rotation relation (Figure [13]
lower and upper panels respectively).

Stars with moderate CRX-length values typically are early-
to mid- M dwarfs with moderate to high levels of stellar activity.
This is shown by (i) their increased v sini levels and short rota-
tion periods (Figure 8p. (ii) generally the Ha activity levels for
their spectral types (Figure 9}, (iii) that they are mostly located
on the saturated part of the rotation-activity relation (Figure[I0)

Fig. 14. Factor of improvement in the RV rms from the subtraction of the RV estimated from the RV-CRX correlation for each star in the CRX-all
sample. Filled points indicate Ha active stars while open points show Ha inactive stars. Symbols are coloured based on CRX-gradient value or

none (grey points). The factor of improvement is shown as a function

of Pearson’s r, stellar rotation period (upper row, left and right), stellar

TiO7050 max-min value (using 95% percentiles) and normalised Ha luminosity (middle row row left and right) and CRX-length / vsini and
(zoomed) spot contrast ratio (lower row left and right). The stars are labelled as indicated in Table[A-T]

and X-ray distributions (not shown), (iv) highest average mag-
netic field strengths for their spectral types (Figure|13]upper and
lower panels).

As we know that the late-M dwarfs saturate in activity we
already know what to expect. The CRX-length is longest for
the stars with mid- to late-M spectral types. Compared to the
CARMENES Ne1025 sample, they are not the most active stars,
in both Ha and average magnetic field strengths, for their spec-
tral type, but they do have moderate to fast v sini values and short
rotation periods (Figure[8). Their normalised Ha levels are close

to or above the blue line (indicating very high levels of Ha ac-
tivity) in Figure Pp] [9Jand are on i: Sean part of the rotation-
activity relation Figure [10]and [13] They also cover the ‘hook’
in the TiO distribution wit spectra type.

6.2. Average magnetic field strength

The average magnetic field strengths were computed from the
telluric corrected co-added templates with exceptional high sig-

nal to noise values . The CRX-gradient

shows moderate values for the stars with the highest average
magnetic field strengths at mid-M spectral types. The average

magnetic field strength have been shown by

to be a proxy of RV variations in the Sun and
other stars in agreement zi ETAT | ut Recently,
the work of [Ruh et al.| (2024) investigated the RV jitter and its
relation to the average magnetic field strength. They showed that
M dwarfs with excess activity-rotation induced RV jitter have

magnetic field filling factors that are dominated by a component
with a strength of 2 to 4 kG.

6.3. Correlations with Bisector Inverse Span (BIS)

All of the CRX-all stars have a strong or moderate (anti-) cor-
relations between CRX and Moment | indicators such as RV.
Recent models of stellar activity, and its impact on the line mo-
ments [Barnes et al.] (2024), show that there is a high likelihood
of having correlations between odd numbered moments such as
Moment | (e.g. RV) and Moment 3 (e.g. the BIS). While the
CRX-index and BIS measure different aspects of the stellar spec-
tra, it is important to also note that the BIS also includes a chro-
matic effect. This is because the skewness of the line profile is
caused by the different velocity patterns as a function of forma-
tion depth, with redder lines being weaker.

Given the similarity of the lemniscate shape of the CRX and
the BIS (see for e.g. [Boise et al.[2011), we additionally in-
vestigate the statistical correlation between the CRX and BIS
(Moment 3 line moment). We use Pearson’s r for the 39 stars
in the CRX-all sample. Our results are shown in Table [A-T] and
confirm that Moment | and Moment 3 are linked with 13 stars
having either a strong or a moderate Pearson’s r value between
the CRX and BIS. The 3 stars that show the highest factor of im-
provement also show a strong correlation between CRX and BIS
(see Appendix Table A.1). This is in agreement with our previ-
ous observational results for the mid M dwarf EV Lac (Jeff

2022), the results of|Schéfer et al.|(2022) for four stars in
the CARMENES sample.

Recently, [Lafarga et al.] (2021) investigated the optimal ac-

tivity indicators to identify activity induced RV signals in M
dwarf stars with a range of activity levels. They report that the
CRX and BIS are the most effective indicators for tracing activity
in high-mass and high-activity (measured by Ha) M dwarfs. A
total of 9 CRX-slope and 4 CRX-Pearson stars are also included
in their sample, where for each of these star the stellar rotation
period is detected in the RV (9 CRX-slope, 4 CRX-Pearson) and
the CRX (9 CRX-slope, 1 CRX-Pearson). A total of 6 CRX-
slope stars and 3 CRX-Pearson stars have both the a periodic
signal detected at the stellar rotation period in BIS.
Previously, the results of
that the BIS span varies as (v sini)’. In Figure
distribution of v sini of the CRX-all sample where the distribu-
tion of the stars with a strong or a moderate correlation between
the CRX-index and the BIS are highlighted. Our results show
that BIS is a significant parameter, at moderate v sini rates and
even at low v sini levels. While models of fixed starspots are im-
portant, a comprehensive analysis also needs to take into account
the variations in the latitude, longitude and lifetimes of the spot
distributions over the time span of data collection.

6.4. Subtraction of the CRX

The subtraction of a linear fit of the CRX-RV anti-correlation
from the RV results in a reduction of the RV rms by a factor of

up to 4. There is a tight correlation of factor of improvement with
Pearson’s r for both the CRX-slope and Pearson-all samples,
where the best stars typically have rotation periods of several
days (Figure [14] top panels), low levels of A TiO and very high
Hy values (Figure [I4]middle panels) and moderate CRX-length
/ vsini values and low to moderate M dwarf spot contrasts. The
moderate rotation periods and low A TiO values point to stable
spot feature, though the high H, values could result from plage
regions appearing dark at the limb centre as suggested by
[som et al (202).

Whether the star has a moderate or a steep CRX-gradient
does not influece the factor of improvement values. However,
in both the A TiO and the Ha activity relations, the CRX-slope
stars with the steepest gradients occupy a separate branch or re-
gion compared to the CRX-slope stars with moderate gradients.
Furthermore, we show that all of the CRX-slope stars with mod-
erate gradients have CRX-length / v sini values that are low to
moderate (with the best factor of improvement values) and that
the steepest gradients have the longest lengths. The stars with
the longest CRX-length values are in the saturated regime of the
rotation-activity plot and have moderate CRX slopes. These re-
lations are summarised in Figure[I4]and Table[5]

6.4.1. Planet detection thresholds

We have demonstrated that the improvement in the RV rms by
removing the contribution of the CRX can be up to a factor of
nearly four. The implications that this has for improving the de-
tectability of small exoplanets was simulated using the dataset
of EV Lac. An exoplanetary signal is first injected in the uncor-
rected data and then the activity contribution is removed
{dona Guillén et al-/2023). With the linear correction factor it is
possible to detect exoplanets that are approximately 2.5 times
less massive compared to the same dataset but without the cor-
rection. The exoplanetary signal can be identified even if it is not
a significant signal in the original dataset. We will explore this
further in forthcoming papers.

Other techniques that exploit the wavelength dependence of
activity induced RVs include the work by|Collier Cameron et al.
(2021). They present test simulations by adding injected signals
of low-mass planets to 5 years of HARPS Sun-as-a-Star observa-
tions of the solar spectrum where planets can be recovered with

a precision of ~ 6.6 cms7!.

In addition to using the wavelength dependence of RVs, there
are currently a large number of methods in the literature to re-
move the impact of stellar activity. An excellent summary of

these methods is reo) by [Meunier 202] [Meunier] (2021) (see their Table
1). Also[Zhao et al] (2022) presented the results of a comparison
of different methods (expanding from the work of
) and concluded that no method is yet per! orming

better than classical linear decorrelation, further supporting the
results we obtained in this work.

6.4.2. Surface mapping

The large-scale magnetic field geometry has been reconstructed
for a total of 6 stars in the CRX-all sample. From these 6 stars,
YZ CMi and EV Lac are also part of the RV.o;3 stars with the
highest reduction in RV rms after the subtraction of the CRX.
V388 Cas, AD Leo and OT Ser are CRX-slope stars and AU
Mic is a CRX-Pearson (moderate) star. The mid-M dwarfs YZ
CMi and EV Lac consistently show an axisymmetric, predomi-
nantly poloidal and simple large-scale magnetic field geometry
that does not change significantly over time periods of approxi-
mately | year The
long-term stability of YZ CMi enabled (2021

fit CARMENES data with one stable starspot. Recently,
also reconstructed several low resolution surface
brightness maps of EV Lac using CARMENES data, and also
found a long-term stable component with small-scale variability
which is consistent with EV Lac’s TESS light curve.

The remaining 3 stars in the CRX-all sample with large-scale
magnetic field maps show a variety of geometries. The mid- M
dwarf V388 Cas exhibits a comparably simple large-scale mag-
netic field geometry as reconstructed for YZ CMi and EV Lac
which is also axisymmetric and predominantly poloidal. The
large-scale magnetic field geometry of the mid-M dwarf AD Leo
shows strong and simple magnetic features, which are mostly
poloidal and axisymmetric and with low level variations over
the time span of | year. On the other hand, the early-M dwarf
OT Ser shows latitudinal rings of mixed polarities that are ax-
isymmetric and dominated by the poloidal component but with

DOT toroidal component (Donati et al.[2008} [Morin]
fat 2008) 2010),

os active planet-hosting star AU Mic, which is a CRX-
Pearson moderate star in this work, has been the focus of an
intensive observational campaign to reconstruct its surface ac-

tivity patterns (Klein et al.|/2021| |2022). AU Mic has surface

brightness features that evolve rapidly, which is consistent with
its young age of 22 Myr and frequent flaring events
let al./2001). It cannot be excluded that the reason why AU Mic
is not a CRX-slope star is because its stellar activity features
evolved on a much more rapid timescale compared to the obser-
vational cadence of the CARMENES data of AU Mic and which
may explain the curved nature of AU Mic’s CRX-RV relation
(see Figure[A-3) and (Cale et al.[2021).

These Zeeman Doppler Imaging (ZDI) observations point to
that (1) early-M dwarfs have weak but complex fields and con-
sequently activity patterns, (2) mid-M dwarfs have less complex
but strong magnetic fields and (3) late-M dwarfs can have either
of these configurations. The results from brightness (Doppler)
imaging typically exhibit more complex spot patterns for all M
spectral pes (Bares & Colfer Cameron/2001
4} [20155] [2015b} for TTI But these results are biased towards
$ with vsin i values that are in excess of 15—20kms~!.

6.5. Sampling of data

One point to consider is that the observations of the
CARMENES GTO stars have been secured with the main aim
of detecting close-in orbiting exoplanets and not characterising
the stellar activity of the target stars. This means that there can be
gaps in the observational timeseries of longer than several stel-
lar rotation periods which is the timescale that we expect stellar
activity features such as spots and plage region to evolve.

If the stellar activity features, and consequently the CRX,
have evolved over this time frame then determining correlations
and removing the contribution of the CRX will be biased by the
time sampling of the dataset. For example, the very detailed anal-
ysis of EV Lac by|Jeffers et al.] (2022) showed that it is possible
to see additional (anti-)correlations between the line moments or
parameters with smaller data sets that cover only a few stellar ro-
tation periods and where the features of stellar activity have not
significantly evolved. In this work we have shown that the sub-
traction of the CRX from the RVs works optimally for moderate
rotation periods, which is likely to result from a combination of
stable global starspot patterns which are more likely to be well
sampled by our CARMENES data.

For very active stars, with higher rotation periods, this could
mean that the stellar activity features have evolved significantly
over the timespan of the observations whereas the more stable

activity patterns are less impacted by the cadence of the observa-
tions. In the future we will investigate if the more rapidly evolv-
ing stellar activity can be mitigated using densely sampled ob-
servations covering a large wavelength range, such is as used by

the RedDots exoplanet search program (Jeffers et al./2020).

7. Conclusions

In this work we have investigated the wavelength dependence of
high-precision RV measurements via the CRX. We conclude the
following:

Approximately 17% of stars in the Carmenes GTO sample
are CRX-all stars (i.e. stars with strong-moderate RV Pear-
son’s r correlations of CRX-index vs RV).

— Dependence on stellar activity diagnostics shows that CRX-
all stars have low to moderate activity levels and cover the
full range of M dwarf spectral types from M1.5 to M8.5.

— The variation of RVs with wavelength can be used to remove
the impact of stellar activity with an improvement in RV rms
of up to a factor of 4. The optimal targets are moderately
active stars.

— The correction effectiveness is related to how stable and
structured the activity patterns are, though more active stars
would be feasible with regular cadence or high density sam-
pled high-precision RVs.

The power of using the wavelength dependent information con-
tained in the spectra themselves is that it is an instantaneous
decorrelation.
