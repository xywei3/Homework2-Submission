We investigate how commonly used parameter definitions in Post-Newtonian (PN) theory compare
with those from Numerical Relativity (NR) for binary black hole (BBH) systems. In NR, masses and
spins of each companion are measured quasi-locally from apparent horizon geometry, whereas in PN
they are attributes of point particles defined via asymptotic matching in body zones. Although these
definitions coincide in the infinite-separation limit, they could differ by finite-separation corrections
that matter for precision modeling. Working entirely in harmonic gauge, we perform asymptotic
matching between each companion’s inner zone metric — obtained from black hole perturbation
theory — and the PN two-body metric, and construct the coordinate transformation that preserves
the gauge in the strong field region. We solve perturbatively for the apparent horizon (AH) on
a group of harmonic inertial time slice and compute its quasi-local areal mass from the horizon

geometry. Then we establish the leading order matching between quasi-local (AH

sed) and PN

(point-particle) parameter definitions in harmonic gauge. We find that on a horizon penetrating
harmonic slicing, the AH quasi-local mass agrees with the PN point-particle mass at 1PN order.
For generic harmonic slicings that deviate from the horizon penetrating condition by a 1PN order

perturbation, the AH mass differs from the PN mass also by a 1PN correction.

This parameter

matching is crucial for hybridizing PN and NR waveforms and for providing better initial conditions
in NR and Cauchy-Characteristic Evolution (CCE) simulations. The framework provides a bridge
between different descriptions of BBH systems, and it can be extended to spinning and eccentric

cases and more general NR gauges.

I. INTRODUCTION

Gravitational-wave astronomy is entering a new preci-
sion era with the arrival of next-generation observatories.
Ground-based detectors such as Cosmic Explorer (CE)
and the Einstein Telescope (ET), together with the space-
based Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), will
probe binary black hole coalescences with sensitivities
far beyond current capabilities. These instruments will
record long-duration signals with extremely high signal-
to-noise ratios (SNRs) [1, 2], providing unprecedented
access to the dynamics of compact binaries across the in-
spiral, merger, and ringdown. As statistical uncertainties
on measured source parameters shrink in this high-SNR,
regime, the burden shifts to theory: waveform models
must achieve accuracy levels such that systematic errors
remain safely below statistical errors. This demand places
renewed emphasis on the consistency of parameter def-
initions used across modeling frameworks. Even subtle
mismatches—such as differences in how masses or spins
are defined in post-Newtonian (PN) versus numerical rela-
tivity (NR) descriptions—can accumulate over thousands
of inspiral cycles and bias astrophysical inference. Ad-
dressing this challenge requires a parameter-consistent
bridge between PN and NR, ensuring that systematic dif
ferences in parameter definitions are carefully considered.

For an isolated system, one can define gauge-invariant
global quantities such as the Arnowitt—Deser—Misner

(ADM) mass and ADM angular momentum, which char-
acterize the energy and angular momentum of the entire
spacetime, including contributions from binding energy
and gravitational radiation. However, in a dynamica!
binary black hole (BBH) spacetime with gravitationa
waves, it is generally ill-defined to decompose the ADM
mass into “mass of hole 1” and “mass of hole 2” withow
additional structure. The difficulty lies in the fact tha
the self-energy of each black hole is inherently mixed with
the system’s binding energy and radiative energy, an
any attempt to separate these pieces depends on a choice
of gauge. NR typically adopts a gauge adapted to the
evolution scheme (e.g. moving-puncture or generalize
harmonic formulations), whereas post-Newtonian (PN)
theory employs the harmonic gauge. Thus, while globa!
quantities are unambiguously defined, the assignment of
masses and spins to individual black holes in a binary is
necessarily gauge-dependent, and PN and NR frameworks
make different gauge choices in practice.

Apart from the gauge difference, PN and NR also use
different definitions. In NR, each black hole’s proper-
ties are measured quasi-locally from the geometry of its
apparent horizon [3, 4]. Using techniques from the iso-
lated/dynamical horizon framework [5, 6], one can define
the individual mass and angular momentum of a black
hole from surface integrals on the AH. Since the AH is
slicing dependent, the individual mass and angular mo-
mentum are also slicing dependent, and they coincide
with the ADM quantities only in the infinite-separation
limit. As the black holes approach each other, each black
hole’s horizon mass incorporates effects of the compan-

ion’s gravitational field. This indicates that the notion
of “mass of an individual BH” in a binary is inherently
scale-dependent, which agrees with the asymptotic mass
at infinite separation, but differs at finite separations due
‘o the presence of binding energy, tidal deformations, and
radiations. The scale-dependent feature of the NR mass
was observed in Ref. [7].
In post-Newtonian theory, one treats the black holes as
oint masses characterized by constant parameters mass
and spin, and solves Einstein’s equations as an expansion
in v/e or GM/(c?r) [8]. To rigorously connect this ideal-
ized point-mass description to an actual black hole, the
PN point-mass parameters are defined via an asymptotic
matching procedure [9]: the inner-zone metric near each
object is asymptotically expanded in series of 1/r, and
matched in an overlap region (buffer zone) to the global
PN metric for the binary system. In this way, the constant
PN mass parameter is essentially the mass parameter of
an isolated BH solution that would produce the same
far-field. At infinite separation, this clearly coincides with
each black hole’s physical mass. However, at finite sepa-
ration the matching can induce differences from NR, once
he two metrics are self-consistently matched. Our aim is
0 quantify this difference at the leading post-Newtonian
order.

Comparisons of PN and NR waveforms have indirectly
noticed parameter discrepancies. Past efforts to hybridize
PN and NR waveforms typically assumed that the masses
and spins used in PN formulas could be taken directly
rom the NR horizon masses and spins read from the
simulation [10-16]. This works well to leading order, but
as modeling accuracy improved, it became evident that
small mismatches in these parameters can visibly affect
he waveform phasing. Recently, Ref. [17] demonstrated
hat allowing slight adjustments (“optimization”) of the
PN masses and spins away from the raw NR values yields
markedly better PN-NR agreement in hybrid waveforms.
In their study, the PN parameters that minimize the
waveform mismatch differ systematically from the NR
values. This finding suggests that PN and NR are using
slightly different conventions for the masses and spins,
reinforcing the need for a proper translation in between.

In this paper, we bridge this gap by deriving an analytic,
leading-order parameter mapping between PN and NR
definitions of mass for binary black holes. To do so, we
need a spacetime metric that is valid in both inner zone
near the horizon (r ~ rs < b) and in the near zone where
the PN two-body metric is valid (rz < r < A). Here
b is the separation between the two black holes, r, is
the Schwarzschild radius of the companion black hole
that we are interested in, and A is the wavelength of the
gravitational radiation.

Refs.[18] and [19, 20] pioneered an approach to build
such global BBH metric, aiming to provide initial data for
NR. Their metric is constructed by matched asymptotic
expansions: they asymptotically matched a near zone
PN metric to a tidally perturbed BH metric around each
black hole in a buffer region where both approximations

are valid. However, in their construction, the coordinates
are not enforced to satisfy a single global consistent gauge
condition, which can complicate our parameter matching
because it’s hard to define a time slice in a gauge consistent
way.

We work entirely in the harmonic gauge for both the
inner zone and near zone to ensure an apple-to-apple com-
parison without gauge ambiguities. We adopt harmonic
gauge for simplicity, but this framework can be extended
to gauges commonly used in NR, e.g., generalized har-
monic formalism used in SpEC. The inner zone metric in
he harmonic gauge is given by Ref. [21] in the comoving
frame with respect to the black hole, which is an isolated
BH solution plus tidal multipoles whose leading contribu-
ions scale as O (M23 /b) —at relative 3PN order. Because
our goal is a leading-order (1PN) parameter matching, we
neglect these higher-order tidal pieces. The coordinate
ransformation between the comoving frame and inertial
rame is constructed by enforcing the harmonic gauge
hrough the strong field region, the boundary conditions
or the gauge equations are provided by asymptotic match-
ing with the PN metric in the buffer region. Applying this
coordinate transformation places the inner zone metric
and near zone metric in the same harmonic coordinate
system.

We solve perturbatively for the AH on a group of har-
monic inertial time slice and compute its quasi-local areal
mass from the horizon geometry. We find that the AH
areal mass generally differs from the PN mass at 1PN
order under 1PN perturbations, but it reduces to the
PN mass when the time slice is horizon penetrating. For
a realistic NR orbital separation (e.g., 10 orbits before
merger), if the time slice is not chosen properly near the
black hole, the fractional mass difference dm/m would
be on the order of 10~?, which is not negligible for the
precision requirements of the next generation detectors.

Aligning the PN and NR parameter definitions through
this matching has several important implications. First,
it enables the construction of PN-NR waveform hybrids
with consistent physical parameters, and it avoids the risk
of overfitting that can bias the parameters. This shoul
reduce systematic mismatches over long inspirals and give
hybrids a more robust physical interpretation. Second,
our results can inform the setup of NR initial conditions.
Current NR simulations of BBHs often start from initial
data specified by approximate methods (e.g. superposec
BHs with PN or effective-one-body estimates for orbital
parameters) and involve some iterations to achieve the
desired masses and eccentricities after relaxation. With a
PN-NR parameter mapping, one could choose the initia
orbital separation and momenta such that the resulting
horizon masses correspond to a given PN binary with
parameters (mj ,mz) at a certain post-Newtonian order.
This would reduce the initial junk radiation and parameter
drift, effectively providing better initial data that already
incorporates the PN corrections at a given order. Addi-
tionally, our framework is formulated in a gauge consistent
manner: we work in harmonic coordinates throughout.

n future extensions, the approach can be generalized to
other gauge choices by first solving for the coordinate
ransformation between harmonic coordinates and the
desired coordinates, and then locating the AH under the
desired slicing condition. The framework itself can also
e straightforwardly extended to include black-hole spins
and orbital eccentricity.

In this paper, we use lower-case Latin indices from
the beginning of the alphabet to denote four-dimensional
spacetime quantities, whereas lower-case Latin indices
from the middle of the alphabet are spatial. We work in
geometrized units with G = c = 1 throughout the paper.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Sec. II reviews the definitions of mass in PN theory and
in NR. Sec. III presents our asymptotic matching scheme
performed in harmonic coordinates. Sec. IV specifies the
harmonic slicing conditions, and we propose a horizon
penetrating harmonic slicing for BBH systems. In Sec. V,
we solve for the AH on the matched slice, extract the
AH areal mass, and derive the leading- order parameter
mapping. We quantify the magnitude of the correction
for typical binary configurations. Finally, Sec. VI con-
cludes the paper with a summary of our key results and
an outlook on extensions, including incorporating spins,
eccentricities and exploring alternative gauges used in

NR.

II. MASS DEFINITIONS IN PN AND NR

In this section, we review how mass is defined in the
PN and in NR for non-spinning BBH systems, and we
clarify how they can be different.

A. PN mass

In the PN approach, each compact object is idealized
as a point particle characterized solely by a constant
mass parameter m, (and spin parameters for spinning
case), with A = 1,2 for a binary. The gravitational
field produced by the point masses is obtained by solving
Einstein’s equations expanded in PN orders. In harmonic
coordinates, where the perturbed metric h®’ = /—gg” —
n° (with nap the Minkowski metric) satisfies the harmonic
gauge condition 0h = 0. The Einstein field equations in
harmonic gauge take the form of inhomogeneous flat-space
wave equations

hn? = 16nr® (1)

where
ab — |gipa 4 1 yap (2)

is the effective stress-energy pseudo-tensor of both mat-

ter and gravity. Here A® is the nonlinear gravitational
source term (quadratic and higher in h) arising from

self-interactions of the field (see Eq. (15) of [22] for full
expression), and the stress-energy tensor for the points
masses is given by

wae Mf easel

The PN mass parameters enter the field solutions through
this integral.

Because point masses generate singular fields, all these
local integrals in the PN iteration require a careful regu-
larization procedure. Blanchet’s MPM-PN scheme [8, 23]
initially employed a Hadamard partie-finie regularization
to handle the divergent self-field of each point mass. While
Hadamard’s method can yield the finite part of most inte-
grals, it was found to break down at the 3PN level, leaving
an undetermined constant in the equation of motion. The
resolution of this problem came from using dimensional
regularization, which is able to preserve the symmetries
of the theory. In practice, one works in general d spatial
dimensions (analytically continued away from d = 3) so
that all integrals are convergent, and defines the physical
theory by the limit d > 3 by taking the finite part of any
1/(d —3) poles. It successfully fixed the cutoff ambiguity,
yielding a fully self-consistent solution for point-mass bi-
naries at high PN order, and with the mass parameters
m, unambiguously defined.

To rigorously connect this idealized point-mass descrip-
tion to an actual black hole, the PN point-mass param-
eters are defined alternatively via an asymptotic match-
ing procedure in Poisson’s approach [9]. Since the PN
two-body metric is only valid in the region r > rs, and
diverges near the point particle, they replace the singular
point-particle with a perturbed black hole solution near
the object (r < d, where d is the separation between two
objects) in this object’s comoving frame. Then they solve
for the tidal moments of the perturbed black hole solution
and the coordinate transformation between the comoy-
ing frame and the PN inertial frame by asymptotically
expanding the both solutions in comoving frame in series
of 1/r, and matching the coefficients in an overlap region
where both the two solutions are valid (rs; <r <d). In
this way, the constant PN mass parameter is essentially
the mass parameter of an perturbed black hole that would
produce the same far-field. At infinite separation or in
the limit that the mass of the secondary object tends to
zero, the PN mass clearly coincides with the black hole’s
Schwarzschild mass.

The horizon absorption of energy should in principle
change the mass of each black hole. PN handles this
horizon absorption by absorbing it into the definition of
binding energy Ey. In this definition, the PN ADM mass
is given by

Eypm =m +m + Ep, (6)
and E, evolves according to the balance law

dEy
pe (Bo t+ Fat Fr), (7)
where Fj, and Fy; are the energy flux to null infinity
and the flux into the horizons, respectively. In this way,
the mass parameters entering the PN expressions are kept
as constants.

B. NR mass

In NR, a black hole’s mass is often defined quasi-locally
on each time slice using its apparent horizon (AH) — a
marginally outer trapped surface. For a non-spinning
hole, the quasi-local (irreducible) mass is given by the

AH areal mass
| A
m= Tén’ (8)

where A is the area of the AH of black hole. This quantity
is geometrically invariant on the slice, but it is slicing
dependent because the AH itself depends on the chosen
time slicing. By contrast, the event horizon (EH) is a
global and gauge invariant null surface, so as the irre-
ducible mass defined from the area of EH. However, the
EH cannot be determined without knowledge of the entire
spacetime evolution, so in practice, the EH based masses
is impractical during a simulation. Consequently, NR
uses AH based, quasi-local measurements which depends
only on local variables on a given time slice. The slicing
dependence of AH introduces an intrinsic ambiguity, thus
the NR quasi-local masses extracted from the AHs need
not coincide with the point-particle masses used in PN
theory. Accordingly, any direct comparison between NR,
and PN requires an explicit, gauge-consistent parameter
translation.

Ill. CONSTRUCTING GLOBAL METRIC

In this section we construct the global metric using the
matched-asymptotic framework [21, 24]. We enforce the
harmonic gauge 0a(\/—gg’) = 0 in the strong field region,
so that the global metric and the coordinate transforma-
tions are valid and gauge-preserving through the horizon.
We work to leading post-Newtonian order (1PN), and we
neglect tidal multipoles whose leading contributions enter
at relative 3PN.

A. Region setup and notations

Consider a binary with component labels A = 1,2,
PN parameters m4, PN trajectories and velocities y 4(t)
and v,(t), and separation b. We introduce the usual PN
expansion parameter v = |vy—v2| < 1. For non-spinning
and quasi-circular case, v? = (m1+mz)/b at leading order.
We also have 0,v; ~ O(1/b?) ~ O(v4), and Ab ~ O(v*),

so we treat them as constants at 1PN order.

Following Ref. [19], we divide the global 4-manifol
as two inner zones of the black holes (r4 < 6), a near
zone (ma < ra < X), and a far zone (r4 > A), as
shown in Fig. 1. Here A is the wavelength of gravitationa’

radiation, and r4 = |x—ya| =

We are only interested in the inner zone, where the met-
ric is given as a non-rotating black hole in the harmonic
coordinates in the black hole’s comoving frame, and the
near zone, where the metric is given by the PN two-body
metric in the inertial frame. In order to match the inner
zone metric with the near zone metric, we use a buffer
region where both descriptions are valid (ma < ra <b).

We use the following notation: we use a bar” to de-
note coordinates or indices in the comoving frame, and
coordinates or indices without the bar are in the inertial
frame. We use superscript or subscript H for harmonic
coordinates, KS for Kerr-Schild coordinates, and CS for
Cook-Scheel coordinates.

B. Inner zone metric

In the inner zone of black hole 1, we start from a Kerr-
Schild Cartesian coordinate system i. = (ts, tks).
The metric there is taken as an isolated black hole solution
plus tidal multipoles [21]. The latter start at O (7?/b?),
which are at relative 3PN and are consistently neglected
for a leading 1PN mass matching. Thus in the inner zone
we retain only the monopolar field of mass parameter
mi4, which is to be related to the PN parameter m1 by
the asymptotic matching.

The inner zone metric of black hole 1 in the Kerr-Schild
Cartesian coordinate at 1PN order is

C. Near zone metric

In the near zone, the metric can be described by the PN
two-body metric in the barycentric harmonic coordinates
2 = (tu, vi;) in the inertial frame. Since our inner
zone comoving frame metric is accurate to 2.5PN, we
will use the 2.5PN two-body metric to reach the same
accuracy in the buffer region. The 2.5PN metric is given
by [25]. We substitute 1/roq = 1/b + O(v*), keep terms
up to O(v?), and truncate the metric to O(m?/r?,,) order,
which is sufficient for our asymptotic matching purpose.

D. Coordinate transformation

Before we match the parameters, it’s important to ex-
press the inner zone and near zone metrics to the same
frame. Ref. [26] proposed a coordinate transformation be-
tween the comoving frame and inertial frame by inserting
the PN trajectory of the black hole, but this approach
generally does not preserve the desired gauge. Ref. [24]
presents a general coordinate transformation by asymp-
totic matching with the PN metric in the buffer region.
It preserves the harmonic gauge in the weak field region
where the metric is flat, but the gauge preserving feature
doesn’t extend to the strong field region near the horizon.
We construct the coordinate transformation by enforcing
the harmonic gauge through the strong field region, and
the boundary conditions for the gauge equations are pro-
vided by asymptotic matching with the PN metric in the
buffer region.

We parameterize the coordinate transformation as

ixs = ty + €°(tn, vty),
Z\ _

here the (1 - we)

factor is introduced to bring the

comoving Kerr-Schild coordinates to a comoving harmonic
coordinates. We further expand €° as

(tu, a}y) = A(tu) — (eu — ya)or) + &(tu, vi). (12)

The first two terms are introduced to keep the trajectory,
and the third term is introduced to preserve the harmonic
gauge. We have A ~ €' ~ O(v?), and « ~ O(1).

Substituting Eq. (12) into Eq. 11, we can solve for the
inverse transformation as

The harmonic condition Eq. (15) does not constrain
A at 1PN order, so we will need to get information of
A and acquire boundary conditions for A, B and D by
asymptotically matching the inner zone metric with the
PN near zone metric in the buffer region.

E. Asymptotic matching

In order to asymptotically match the inner zone metric
with the PN near zone metric, we first need to transform
the inner zone metric to the inertial frame in the harmonic
coordinates

dent of txg, so we can decompose K as K (tks, tg) =
Ki (txs)K2(Zxg). Given that both the inner zone metric
and near zone metric have no explicit dependence on time,
and that Ay (fxs) enters directly in the Jacobian Eq. (22),
then K,(txs) must be constant. So K = K (zg). For

We use B,D,A and « from Eq. (26), (29), (33) and
(35) to transform the inner zone metric Eq. (9), the results
agrees exactly with the near zone metric Eq. (10) for the
available orders in m1/riy up to O(v7). This suggests
that the | > 0 modes of K vanishes at 1PN order, which
agrees our spherical symmetric ansatz Eq. (30).

IV. SLICING CONDITION

The apparent horizon is slicing dependent, but the
slicing conditions that satisfy the harmonic condition is
not unique. We can add any function F'(ixs, Zig) to the
harmonic time ty in Eq. (37) as long as F satisfies the
harmonic condition Eq. (15). For simplicity, we focus on
the static case, so F = F(Zi,.). Putting it into Eq. (15),
we get

The general spherically symmetric solution is

where fp is just an arbitrary constant time shift that we
are setting to zero.
We note that when

the harmonic time slice becomes

(41)
which is regular through the horizon. This is the gener-
alized case of the Cook-Scheel slicing [27], which is the
unique harmonic and horizon penetrating slicing for an
isolated single black hole.

To study the dependence of the AH quasi-local mass
on the slicing condition, we perturb the generalized
Cook-Scheel slicing condition in Eq. (41) by setting

fi = 2m, (1 + avy — 2m, 6v?.

V. AH QUASI-LOCAL MASS

The apparent horizon of a black hole is defined as an
outer marginally trapped surface on a given time slice. It
is a closed 2-surface whose outgoing null normal has zero
expansion. If one combines the AH on each time slice into
a 3-dimensional surface, this worldtube will depend on
the slicing. As we will see, this slicing dependent feature
of the AH will bring ambiguity into the quasi-local mass
defined from the AH geometry.

A. Finding the apparent horizon

Here we solve for the AH on the given time slice T =
const. in Eq. (42). The future-pointing unit timelike
normal to this time slice is given by

T, = —aD,T, (43)

where D, is the covariant derivative with respect to the
4-metric gap, and
a= (-g? Da DoT)”. (44)

The induced 3-metric on this time slice is given by

Gg) = gab + TaT- (45)

Let s* be the unit outward pointing normal to the AH
2-surface in this time slice, so that

a'r = 0, Swed, rm Sal, (46)

then the 2-metric on the AH 2-surface is

9 = =gap PTT} — 588, (47)

and

1
v2
is the future-pointing null geodesic congruence whose
projection on the 3D time slice is orthogonal to the AH 2-

surface. Note that k“ is only defined on the AH 2-surface,
its extension away from the 2-surface is not defined. The

k* = —(r* + 8°) (48)
AH is defined by the vanishing of expansion on the 2-
surface, which is

0 = 9?) Daky = 0. (49)

Since the covariant derivative of ka is projected onto the
2-surface by g’2)*", no knowledge of the extension of k*
away from the 2-surface is required. Only if k® is affinely
parametrized, i.e., k¢Dk® = 0 in the neighborhood of
the 2-surface, Eq. (49) reduces to Dak* = 0.

Note that T*DyTq = 0 and s*Dysq = 0 from Eq. (46),
Eq. (49) can be simplified as

1
e=— [g"’Da(t + sy) + 77 Dasy — s*s’ Dat] = 0.
v2
(50)
We will use this equation for the remaining calculations.
In order to get s*, we parametrize the AH 2-surface in
the comoving Kerr-Schild coordinates by
R =Tixs — 2m, — RO, é)
=Fixs — 2m — SR, ¥'(0,8) =0, OY)
im
with (9,4) defined by

Here Rj, ~ O(v), given that we are on a time slice that
is perturbed from the horizon-penetrating one by O(v?).
Then we have

st = DR (53)

Eq. (50) is a scalar equation which does not transform

under coordinate trans:

formations, so we solve it in the
oordinates, which simplifies the
compared with working in the

inertial harmonic coordinates. We substitute the slicing
Eq. (42) and the comoving metric Eq. (9) into Eq. (50),
project it onto 1, modes, and truncate terms to O(v?)
and O(R), we obtain

Rog = — Vim 5? + O(v?),

_ (54)
Risom =O v*),
so the AH is given by
Tiks = 2m, — Fou. (55)

For the horizon penetrating slicing, ie., 6 = 0, the AH
reduces to the Kerr-Schild horizon at 7ixKg = 2m1.

B. Quasi-local mass

The AH a local mass is defined from the area of
the AH by Eq. (8). The AH area A is given by

Pig
A= [ ao [ ay 492 — of” oe

(56)

where

2 2
9:5) = ag BxsOge Zixs: (57)

Note that from Eq. (42), we have ixg =
(Fixs — m1) (NKsv1) + ..., so the Jacobian is

const. —

052° =Tixs (a eens )v1 cos(@) sin(d), cos(8) cos(4),

05x" =Tiks (a-2 -

sin(9) cos(4), 0).

— 1 )y; sin(A) cos(d), — sin(@) sin(4),
TiKs

(58)
Substituting the AH (55) and the 2-metric (47), we get
the AH quasi-local mass from Eq. (8) as

me! = my (2 a i?) . (59)

For the horizon penetrating slicing, i.e., 6 = 0, the
AH quasi-local mass agrees with the PN mass at 1PN
order. But for a general harmonic slicing condition that
is perturbed from the horizon penetrating one by 1PN
order at O(v?), the AH quasi-local mass is also perturbed
from the PN mass by O(v?). For a realistic NR, orbital
separation (e.g., 10 orbits before merger), O(v?) would
be on the order of 10~?, which is not negligible for the
precision requirements of the next generation detectors.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have provided a gauge-consistent bridge between
apparent horizon quasi-local and PN point-particle pa-
rameter definitions for non-spinning, quasi-circular BBH
systems at leading PN order, working entirely in harmonic
gauge. By constructing a harmonic and gauge-preserving
map between the inner zone black hole metric and the
near zone PN two-body metric, we constructed a global
harmonic metric for BBH, and we generalized the Cook-
Scheel harmonic horizon penetrating slicing to the BBH
case. We located the apparent horizon on harmonic time
slices, and derived the leading order relation between the
AH areal mass and the PN mass parameter at 1PN order.
We find that on a horizon penetrating harmonic slicing
he generalized Cook-Scheel slice), the AH quasi-local
mass agrees with the PN point-particle mass at 1PN or-
der. For generic harmonic slicings that deviate from the
horizon penetrating condition by an O(v) perturbation,
the AH mass differs from the PN mass by a fractional
amount Am = —4ov?. For typical orbital velocities at re-

alistic NR separations (e.g., 10 orbits before merger), this
amounts to O(10~?) corrections, which is not negligible
at the precision demanded by next generation detectors.

Our work neglected tidal multipoles entering at rela-
tive 3PN, and restricted to non-spinning, quasi-circular

binaries. Some natural extensions would include: (i) in-
corporating spin and eccentricity to obtain mappings for
both mass and angular momentum; (ii) adding leading
tidal effects and extend to higher PN orders; (iii) translat-
ing the mapping from harmonic to gauges more commonly
used in NR (e.g., damped harmonic in SpEC) via explicit
coordinate transforms that preserves the new gauge.

Extending the matching procedure to the actual NR
gauges would enable PN-NR waveform hybridizations to
be performed with parameter consistent inputs, reducing
the need for ad-hoc optimization of PN masses to fit NR
and thereby decreasing the risk of parameter bias over
long inspirals. It also suggests a practical prescription for
NR initial data by starting from a global gauge-consistent
metric that is accurate to a given PN order, which could
potentially mitigate junk radiation and parameter drift
during the early evolution.
