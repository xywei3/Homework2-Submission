Quantum metrology is a science about quantum measurements and it plays a key role in precision of quantum
parameter estimation. Meanwhile, quantum coherence is an important quantum feature and quantum Fisher
information (QFI) is an important indicator for precision of quantum parameter estimation. In this paper, we
explore the relationship between QFI and quantum coherence in multi-dimensional quantum systems. We in-
troduce a new concept referred to as General Quantum Coherence (GQC), which characterizes the quantum
coherence and the eigenenergies of the Hamiltonian in the interaction processes. GQC captures quantum nature
of high-dimensional quantum states and addresses shortcomings in coherence measurement. Additionally, we
observe a stringent square relationship between GQC and QFI. This finding provides a crucial guideline for
improving the precision of parameter estimation.

I. INTRODUCTION

Metrology, as a science of measurements, has had an immense impact on our world. It provides original data in the field of
scientific research. In the realm of quantum mechanics, this discipline is referred to as quantum metrology, playing a crucial role
in the study of quantum mechanics. It is indispensable for enhancing the precision of estimating unknown parameters| 1-3]. In
general, the whole estimation process can be divided into three steps: the preparation of the initial probe state p;,,; the evolution
of the initial probe state (described by a unitary operator U(y) with an unknown parameter y); and the detection of the probe
output state p(y). When the probe state is a quantum state, and it is a separable state, the parameter estimation error is limited
to a scaling factor of 1/,/Ni, known as the standard quantum limit [4-6].

According to the quantum Cramér-Rao bound [7-12], the reciprocal of quantum Fisher information(QFI) provides a lower
bound on the variance of the estimator ¢ is 6g > 1/ VFa. , where d¢ represents the standard deviation and Fg is the QFI. QFI,
which encapsulates the information related to quantum states, has applications in various domains such as quantum information
procession and transmission. The reciprocal of the QFI establishes the lower limit on the variance of the estimator, in other
words, a larger QFI indicates a higher precision in parameter estimation. Therefore, the study of the fractional determinants of
QFI holds significant importance.

To uncover the essence of quantum metrology, extensive research has been conducted on the correlation between QFI and
various properties of quantum states. These properties encompass quantum entanglement [13-17], fidelity [18-20], spin squeez-
ing parameters [13, 21, 22], quantum discord [23-25], and so on. However, until now, a definitive relationship between these
quantum properties and QFI has not been established. In fact, these investigations have been delved into a range of quantum
correlation properties such as quantum entanglement [26, 27], quantum discord [28, 29], quantum non-locality, quantum steering
[30, 31], spin squeezing parameters [32, 33], and so on. These properties collectively can be considered as a form of generalized
quantum coherence. Consequently, our attention has been drawn to exploring the connection between quantum coherence and
QFI.

In quantum metrology, attention is drawn to a phenomenon wherein two quantum states exhibit maximal coherence, namely
{zs (]0) + |1))} and {zy (|0) + |N))}. Despite sharing the same level of coherence, these states have distinct QFI values 1

and N? respectively. What are the reasons behind these observed phenomena?

In order to overcome this question and rectify limitations in existing measurement schemes, this paper introduces a new
concept involving quantum coherence: general quantum coherence (GQC). The GQC denotes that the quantum coherence is
extended, and it includes the quantum coherence and the energy levels of quantum system. In 2012, Frowis and Diir used the QFI

*mingyang @ahu.edu.cn
tyangep@hznu.edu.cn
as a measure of macroscopicity[34], and it revealed that QFI and macroscopicity of quantum states have an intimate connection.
In 2017, Kwon et al proposed a measure of macroscopic coherence based on the degree of disturbance caused by a coarse-
grained measurement [35]. Our new concept (QGC) and macroscopic coherence (MC) [36-44] have many similarities, however
the GQC and MC come from different sources. The MC is from combining quantum coherence and system energy levels, and
the GQC is from the study in which the quantum coherence of the probe state plays major roles. Concurrently, we show that QFI
is equivalent to the square of GQC. This insight prompts an exploration into the fundamental reasons why quantum metrology
outperforms classical metrology. The results highlight a significant and straightforward relationship between QFI and GQC.
This paper is organized as follows. In section H, QFI is introduced. In section III, GQC is introduced for pure quantum state.
In section IV, GQC is extend to mixed quantum state. In section V, we provide an example in which GQCs and QFls of the states

a (|0) + |1)) and a (|00) + |11)) are investigated in experiment. Section VI summarizes the main findings of this work.

II. QUANTUM FISHER INFORMATION

In general, a probe initial state p undergoes a parametrization process with a parameter y. The QFI for the output state p, can
be written by [9, 51, 52]

Fg =Tr(p,L’) , ()

where Fg represents QFI, L is called as symmetric logarithmic derivative and it can be expressed as follows

Op, _1

= = - (Lp, pL). 2

ap 3 ( Poe + Pe ) (2)

If the parametrization is a unitary process described by a unitary operator Up, = et? the output state of the probe is given by
po = Uppt3. (3)

Here, H is the the parametrization Hamiltonian applied in the parameter estimation process. Without loss of generality, consider
that the probe is initially in an arbitrary mixed state p = )7/"_, p;|wi) (|, where |x;) is an eigenstate of p with an eigenvalue pj.
The QFI can be expressed as [45, 48]

Ay . (pi = pj)? I) ET lohy.\|2
F(p,H) =2 $$ — | (Wi | |;)|"- (4)

On the other hand, consider that the probe is initially in an arbitrary pure state |7). According to [45, 48], the QFI is given by

F (|W), ) = 4 ((U|AP |b) — (WlEy)”) (5)

Il. GENERAL QUANTUM COHERENCE FOR PURE STATE

Quantum coherence is the most distinguished feature of quantum mechanics, characterizing the superposition properties of
quantum states. As a quantity of coherence, we use the /,-norm of coherence C), [49]

Cr, = D> [pis (6)

ij

A. A two-dimensional parameterization system

For a two-dimensional parametrization system (i.e., a qubit), the parametrization process is characterized by the Hamiltonian

H = diag (Xo, 1) , (7)

where the eigenstates (eigenvalues) of the parametrization Hamiltonian are labeled by {|0), |1)} ({Ao, A1}), and diag (-) denotes
a diagonal matrix.
If the parametrization process is described by a spin Hamiltonian, the relationship between QFI and quantum coherence is
written by [50]

Fo =C?. (8)
Because the eigenvalues of the spin Hamiltonian are 5 and 4, it follows from Eq. (8)
1 is |?
Fg =C?-|=—-(-=
=e 5-5) 0)

with Ag = $ and Ay = —3.
According to Eq. (9), for an arbitrary parametrization Hamiltonian H given in Eq. (7), we can infer the following relationship

Fg =C?-(do— 1). (10)
In order to prove Eq. (10), we first consider that the probe initial state is an arbitrary pure state given by
1b) = exlk) + eal), qt)

where |k) and |I) are the two basis states, which are chosen as the two eigenstates of the parametrization Hamiltonian Al with
eigenvalues \;, and A;, which are given by

Ae = (klk),
x = (|All). (12)
Thus, according to Eq. (6), the coherence of the state in Eq. (11) is
C(\)) = 2leecf (13)

Note that for a pure state |x), the QFI is expressed as Eq. (5). Thus, base on Eq. (5) and Eq. (12), one can easily find that the

QFI for the state in Eq. (11) is
4 , 2
4 | (uidtey — (wie) |

= Alcnet|? «Ar — 1)?

= C?- (An — i)’, (14)

Fo (Iv), #)

which shows that the QFI is determined by the quantum coherence C of the probe initial state
between the eigenvalues of the parametrization Hamiltonian corresponding to the basis states.
From Eg. (14), C (|2)) « |Ai — Aj| is defined as a new quantity as follows

w) and the difference A, — Ax

M=C-|\ —Ajl- (15)

Here, M is the extension of quantum coherence, it includes the coherence C and the energy level difference |A; — ;| of two
basis states. Therefore, we call this new concept as general quantum coherence (GQC).

B. A high-dimensional parametrization system

In this subsection, we will extend the new conception (15) to a high-dimensional parametrization system (i.e., a qudit). For
an n-dimensional system, the parametrization process is characterized by the Hamiltonian

Ht = diag (Xo, 1, A2,-** ; An—1) (16)
where Ao, A1, A1,°-- , and A,,—1 are the eigenvalues of the parametrization Hamiltonian Hi and the corresponding eigenstates
of the parametrization Hamiltonian H are labeled by |(), |1),-+-, and |n — 1). The eigenvalues are given by

di = (ili), (17)
where 7 = 0,1,2,--- ,m— 1. For such a system, an initial arbitrary pure state of the probe can be written as
|b) = ao|0) + ay|1) +... + @n—iln — 1), (18)

where the basis states |0), |1), ..., and |n — 1) are chosen as the eigenstates of the parametrization Hamiltonian H.
In order to quantify coherence of the state |x), the n-level quantum system will be divided into many two-level subsystems.
For the subsystem with two levels |k) and |1), an arbitrary quantum pure state is given by

Prt) = an|k) + ail), (19)

where k, 1 = 0,1, 2,...,2—1. So, the coherence of the state |%,1) is 2\a,.aj'|, corresponding to the GQC being 2|axa7|-|Ax — Ai|-
Considering all the cases, the possible definitions of the GQC of the pure state |¢) in Eq. (18) are written as:

(20)

or
M (\W), #) = 352 aia5| [Ai — 31 - (21)

i<j
From Eq. (20) and Eq. (21), we think that Eq. (20) is more appropriate than Eq. (21), because the quantum coherence is a
vector superposition and should satisfy the vector superposition principle. We use Eq. (20) as the definition of GQC. The QFI
of Eq. (18) is
Faq (\W),H) = 4 ((H?) —(H)’)
n-1
Solas? lajl? i — Ay)? - (22)

i<j
Base on Eq. (20) and Eq. (22), the relationship between GQC and QFI is
Fa (|), H) = M? (

<2

by). (23)
From Eq. (23), we find that QFI of a pure quantum state is equal to square of GQC.

IV. GENERAL QUANTUM COHERENCE FOR MIXED STATE

In the previous section, we have defined the GQC for pure state and the determining factors of QFI when the probe initial
state is a pure state. In this section, we will extend the GQC to mixed state and discuss the case when the probe initial state is a
mixed state.

A. A two-dimensional parametrization system

In order to study the mixed-state case, we first consider a two-dimensional parametrization system. In this case, an initial
arbitrary mixed state of the probe can be written as

P = polOx) (On| + Pilla) al, (24)

where po + pi = 1, po and pj, are two eigenvalues of p, |0;) and |1;) are two eigenstates of p. We suppose that the two
eigenstates are

|0i) = ao|0) + a4|1),
ee ae @5)

where |) and |1) are the eigenstates of the parametrization Hamiltonian H given in Eq. (7) with eigenvalues \y = (0|H|0) and
i = (1|H|1) respectively. Because of (07/17) = 0 and |On)(Oz| + |1a)(1a| = Z, one has

agai + bjbi = 0,
aga} + bobi = 0, (26)
aby + a,b} = 0.
Thus, the square of coherence of the probe initial state p given in Eq. (24) is

CO? (p) = 4|poaoay + prbobi |?

2
= 4|poaoay — piaoa)|

A(po — p1)? lava |?

= (po — pi)?apazasay

= ~2(po — pi)” (aoajbjbi + apaibobi) - (27)
According to Eq. (4), the QFI is

a 4(p9 — 91)? - 2
Fo(p.ft) = SPY Yo, stI15)
(po ~ pa)? |(On|H|12)| «(1x1 10x)

= ~2(po — pr)? (apazbgbr + ajarbobt) (Ao — An)?

C?(p) (Ag — a)”. (28)

Eq. (28) shows that the QFI is determined by the quantum coherence C'(p) of the probe initial state p and the difference Ay — A1

between the eigenvalues of the parametrization Hamiltonian corresponding to the basis states. Thus, according to Eq. (15), the
square of GQC is defined by

M? (p) = —2 (po — pr)? (aoazbjb1 + a§a1b0b7) (Ao — A)? - (29)
Thus, we have the relationship between GQC and QFI
Fo(p,H) = M? (). (30)

B. A high-dimensional parametrization system

Now we extend the GQC (29) to a high-dimensional parametrization system. In the following, we will consider an n-
dimensional system. The parametrization process is characterized by the Hamiltonian (16) with eigenvalues given in Eq. (17).
An initial arbitrary mixed state of the probe can be expressed as

p=> pili) (bil, GL)
1

where |y;) is an eigenstate of p given in Eq. (31), p; is an eigenvalue of p (i.e., the probability of |7);) appearing in the mixed
state p), and $7", p; = 1. The eigenstates of p are expressed as

pre |v) =a? |0) + af? 1) + ah? [2) +----+al In = 1),
pa: |W2) = ap” |0) +a) |1) +a)? [2) +++ ah? In 1),
pit [bk) = a0) + 0891) + a 2) +--+ In —1,
pj: |bj) = af) |0) + af [1) 4 “Q beta |n 1),
Pr: |v) a”) 0) 4 al” |1) | ap) ‘ae a In 1). (32)

where the basis states |(), |1), ---, and |n — 1) are chosen as eigenstates of the parametrization Hamiltonian H with eigenvalues
Ao, Ai, +++, and An—1 respectively. Here, \; = (i|H|i) @ =0,1,---,n—1).
For the eigenstates of p given in Eq. (32), we take two arbitrary eigenstates (|y;), |¢;)) to form a new quantum state

1
Dax bi| + py lws)(wyl), 33
Pig = o> py Pilenk )(val + pyle (esl) (33)
which is a part of the mixed state p. The two eigenstates |x);) and |y;) are given by
jy) = al |0) + al |1) + af! 2) + o+ af) iln- 1), (34)
vj) = ay? |0) + ay? |) 4 ha) + -+ a) ,|n—1). (35)

Now, we choose two arbitrary basis states {|k), |I)} to construct the following two pure states of a quantum state of a two-
dimensional subsystem

he) = a |k) +a [1), (36)
wy) = af? |k) + af? Il). (37)

In this two-dimensional subsystem, we adopt |S) and Iw) to form the following quantum state

kl 1 (kl kl i (aL kl
BD = py (mill HL + vals 009 1) (38)
According to Eq. (27), the coherence of this constructed quantum state a is
(ct?)’ =-2 (ee at [ah af az Ma +a: a(aPar| (39)
% J

and the GQC Mi? of Eq. (38) can be written as

(mis?) a) (25%) [af 7 GGA 4 tO aDas all (re —d)?. (40)
Pi + Pj
For the constructed quantum state p;,; in Eq. (33), we thus obtain

Therefore, for the probe initial mixed state p in Eq. (31), the GQC of p given in Eq. (31) can be written as follows

M(p) = [3 0(pi + p)M?; (42)

The calculation process for obtaining the expression of M() given in Eq. (42) is illustrated in Fig. 1.
The QFI for a mixed state p in Eq. (31) is expressed as Eq. (4). We calculate |(;|H|w;)|? and obtain

FIG. 1: The illustration of calculation process for mixed state case.

Based on Eq. (44), the relationship between QFI and GQC can be written as follows
Fo(p, H) = M*(p). (45)
Based on Eq. (45), we find that QFI of parameter estimation is equal to the square of GQC of the probe state. This result implies

that the QFI is determined by the GQC. The GQC can be enhanced by increasing the GQC.

V. EXPERIMENT

To produce the two quantum states |) and |72), we use the single photon source and the entanglement photon source,
respectively. We use one barium borate (BBO) crystal to realize the spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), and then
use a polarization beam splitter (PBS) and a half wave plate (HWP) with 22.5° to produce the state |7), = wa (|H) +|V))

by the single photon [Fig. 2(a)]. We use two BBO crystals (perpendicular each other) to realize SPDC and produce a pair
of entangled photons. We first adjust the polarization of the pump light by a HWP with 22.5° and then let the pump light pass
through two BBO crystals (perpendicular each other) to produce the maximally entangled state |). = a (|HH) + |VV))[Fig.

|wb)2 (Fa,) is 3.9346 [Fig. 3(b)]. Thus, we obtain

Fo, © 4Fo,. (52)

We note that the coherence of |y); in Eq. (46) and |7))2 in Eq. (47) are both 1. The difference between the eigenvalues of the
Hamiltonian H, for the two basis state |) and |1) involved in the state |x); is 1. The difference between the eigenvalues of
the Hamiltonian H for the two basis states |00) and |11) involved in the state |y)2 is 2. Thus, based on Eq. (14), we have
FQ, = 4FQ, in theory, which is confirmed by the experiment result given in Eq. (52).

VI. CONCLUSION

We find that quantum coherence is the intrinsic reason why quantum metrology can make a better performance than classical
metrology. Quantum coherence of the probe states plays a special role in quantum metrology, and this is in contrast to the case of
classical metrology. However, the quantum coherence has a limitation because it is not related to the difference of energy levels
of two basis states. In order to overcome this defect, the quantum coherence is extended and general quantum coherence (GQC)
is introduced. We have studied the relationship between GQC and QFI, which can be expressed by a simple formula Eq. (45).
The result shows that the GQC of the probe states plays a crucial role in the quantum parameter estimation. Our findings open a
new avenue to improve the precision of quantum parameter estimation in the future.
