We apply weakly coupled QCD kinetic theory to investigate the thermalization of high-momentum
on-shell partons (minijets) in a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Our approach incorporates isotropic
hard thermal loop screening to model soft quark and gluon exchanges, allowing us to verify consis-
tency with established analytic results of jet transport coefficients. We perform kinetic simulations
of minijets propagating through a thermal gluon plasma, incorporating both collinear radiation and
elastic scatterings. The resulting evolution is compared to predictions from jet transport coefficients,
including the longitudinal and transverse jet-quenching parameters g, energy loss, and the drag co-
efficient. We find that standard definitions of jet transport coefficients neglect the contributions
from recoiling medium particles. Including these contributions restores consistency with the kinetic
evolution. Finally, we show that the minijet thermalization time scales remarkably well with g and
we produce a phenomenological estimate of the minijet quenching time in heavy-ion collisions.

I. INTRODUCTION i [10]. These coefficients have been studied exten-

sively within different theoretical frameworks: leading

equivalent proton—proton baseline [5}9]. Hard scatter- ion between the jet energy and the medium tempera-
ings initially produce highly virtual partons that undergo ure. A more realistic description of jet quenching re-

rapid vacuum-like splittings. As they lose virtuality and quires frameworks that can follow the dynamics of en-
ecome on-shell, further splittings occur only through ergetic probes from their initialization to eventual ther-
medium interactions. We refer to these on-shell par- malization. Within the framework of QCD kinetic the-
ons as minijets to distinguish them from high-virtuality ory simulations, the minijet thermalization studies have

derstanding of how energetic partons interact with the lows one to investigate jet-medium interactions in out-
evolving medium remains an outstanding problem. Here of-equilibrium conditions, as realized in the early stages
we study how the energy and momentum transport of of realistic nuclear collisions.

high-momentum partons relate to the evolution and ther-
malization of minijets in a kinetic framework.

Jets traversing the Quark-Gluon Plasma are com-
monly characterized by transport coefficients such as
he transverse/longitudinal momentum broadening co-
efficient g, longitudinal drag 7, and conversion rate

In this work, we employ the leading-order QCD effec-
tive kinetic theory (EKT) to directly compare the tradi-
tional transport-coefficient description of jet quenching
with the full microscopic evolution of on-shell jets in a
medium. For simplicity, we restrict the study to the
Yang-Mills sector, where gluonic perturbations propa-
gate through a thermal gluon plasma. The EKT frame-
work, which has been successfully applied to study the
chemical, kinetic, and hydrodynamic thermalization of
the QGP as well as electromagnetic probes [2 [3] [38+
[44], also contains the essential physics of high-momentum
parton energy loss [10]. For recent applications to mini-
jet thermalization in static and expanding plasmas see

Refs. [32}{35] [37]. In this work, we employ an isotropic
HTL screening prescription for elastic scatterings [45]
and demonstrate consistency with analytic results for je
ransport coefficients in the infinite jet-energy limi F In
contrast, for finite minijet momentum, we show that tra-
ditionally neglected effects, such as medium recoil and
radiative corrections, play an important role in defining
ransport coefficients. We formulate a cutofft-dependen
definition of transport coefficients by including contribu-
ions from all particles with momenta p > Acutor and an-
alyze the resulting cutoff dependence. Our analysis clar-
ifies the connection between transport coefficients anc
ull kinetic theory evolution of jet quenching. Finally, we
‘ollow the minijet evolution up to thermalization and ex-
ract the corresponding thermalization time, which scales
remarkably well with g. This relation provides a com-
act parametrization for minijet thermalization in the
medium.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section
riefly describe the EKT framework and the initial con-
ditions of the EKT evolution. In particular, we com-
ment on the implementation of isotropic HTL screening
used in this work. Section introduces the definitions
of transport coefficients in kinetic theory and highlights
he approximations made in the traditional definitions.
We then make a numerical comparison of transport co-
efficients extracted from the EKT evolution and those
from direct computations for different low-momentum
cutoffs. In Section study minijet thermalization
and show the scaling of the thermalization time with
Transport properties. Our conclusions are given in Sec-
ion [VY] For completeness, our paper included a number
of appendices. In Section we present explicit expres-
sions for the collision kernels. In Section we detail
he implementation of isotropic HTL screening for soft
gluon and quark exchanges and validate the computed
ransport coefficients in the infinite jet-momentum limit
against known analytic results. In Section [C] we define
he expectation value of a general observable in the sin-
gle collision limit and in Section [D] we provide the corre-
sponding numerical implementation details. Finally, we
demonstrate the convergence of transport coefficient ex-
raction from the EKT evolution in Section |[E]

II. QCD KINETIC THEORY SETUP

The high-temperature QGP can be described as a
weakly interacting gas of quarks and gluons. The par-
ticles are then characterized by phase-space distribution

freedom, 16 for gluons and 6 for each flavor of quarks
and antiquarks. The distribution functions obey the rel-
ativistic Boltzmann equation

where C, encodes the collision processes. The relevant
collision processes were systemized by Arnold, Moore and
Yaffe (AMY) [LJ] using the hard thermal loop framework
at leading order in the QCD coupling \ = g?N.. They
consist of elastic 2 ++ 2 scatterings and collinear 1 + 2
inelastic collisions for massless particles P° = |p| = p at
sufficiently high momentum (p > gT).

The elastic collision kernel is given by a multi-
dimensional momentum integral

The |Mee|? is the spin-, and color-summed hard ther-
mal loop (HTL) matrix element (see Section [B). In the
vacuum, it has a pole in the small-momentum exchange
limit, while at finite temperature, due to screening, it is
regulated by in-medium masses. In previous works [39}
[44] [4649], these matrix elements were approximated by
simple Debye-like screened vacuum matrix elements in-
cluding a soft-momentum regulator (Debye-like prescrip-
tion), whose parameter € was chosen to reproduce longi-
tudinal gluon momentum broadening and the gluon-to-
quark conversion rate in equilibrium.

Recently, the more complete isotropic HTL screen-
ing prescription was used in the Boltzmann equation in
Refs. [33] [35] instead of its approximated Debye-like
prescription, and differences regarding the shear viscosity
and the pressure anisotropy were identified. Here, we ex-
tend previous work by demonstrating that the isotropic
HTL screening prescription simultaneously reproduces
the analytical results for longitudinal and transverse mo-
mentum diffusion in the infinite jet-momentum limit.
We further develop the isotropic HTL screening for soft
quark exchanges and show that it reproduces the gluon-
to-quark conversion rate in the same limit. Since the

remainder of this paper focuses on minijets of finite mo-

mentum in a gluonic plasma, we delegate the detailed

description of the HTL screening implementation and its

validation against results in the literature to Section [B}

ion[A] In practice for numerical efficiency, we interpolate
etween the Bethe-Heitler and Landau-Pomeranchuk-
Migdal limits, which reproduces well the results of the
inear integral equation, which sums up multiple interac-
ions, see Appendix B of Ref. [50].

In this work we will focus on a thermal Yang-Mills
lasma at constant temperature T’, and where its thermal
distribution n (Bose-Einstein for gluons) is perturbed by
a “minijet” at some energy scale E (but homogeneous
in space). To follow the evolution of the minijet, we
employ the linearized Boltzmann equation, which is ob-
ained by substituting f = n+ df in Eq. (I) and keeping
only terms linear in 6f. The linearized collision kernels
have been discussed in previous works and we do not
repeat the lengthy expressions here [37]. We note that

depend implicitly on the distribution function f. There-
ore, generally, the linearized collision kernels should also
contain linear corrections to [art |? and yj, (see [37]).
However, in thermal equilibrium, these corrections are
multiplied by the statistical factors Eqs. (4) and that
vanish identically. Thus, in the considered case of ther-
mal background, the linearized collision kernels contain
only those linearized terms that originate from the sta-
tistical factors.

Ill. JET TRANSPORT COEFFICIENTS FROM
THE BOLTZMANN EQUATION

In this section, we introduce the EKT linearization
framework and minijet dynamics, and we derive their re-
lationship with traditional definitions and computations
of jet transport coefficients. Finally, we make a numerical
comparison between transport properties extracted from
the linearized EKT evolution and from a direct evalua-
tion.

A. Linearized Boltzmann equation and observables

The linearized Boltzmann equation for the minijet as
a small perturbation around the homogeneous medium
(f =n+f) is given by

A5fi(t,p) = 6Cil{n, 5f}] , (7)

where 6C;[{n,5f}] is the linearized collision term. It
contain elastic and inelastic scatterings dC; = dC??? +
6C}? that originate from Eq.
earization as detailed in Section [A]

As we consider a non-expanding and homogeneous glu-
onic medium in thermal equilibrium, the background
medium satisfies the Bose-Einstein distribution n(p) =
1/(e?/? —1). The initial condition for the minijet is,
however, taken as a perturbation at momentum po. For
analytical calculations, we employ a Delta function,

dfi(t=to,p) = €T? x (27)*5ii,5° (p— po), (8)

with initial species index ig. As the distribution function
must be dimensionless, we have included a T? factor mul-
tiplied by an arbitrary dimensionless parameter €, where
we assume that « < 1 that justifies the linearization.
Note that for numerical simulations of Eq. (7). we will
instead use a narrow Gaussian function that will be in-
troduced later.

We define jet observables through the expectation
value

Divi Jp O(P: 4) 5 fill)

(O(p;%)) (9)

where the denominator is evaluated for the initial dis-
tribution at t = tp. Note that this definition allows for
multiple scatterings and thus a nontrivial evolution of the
observables due to the dynamics of the minijet of;(t, p),
even for a non-evolving medium, such as in our case. This
allows us to study jet thermalization due to multiple elas-
tic and inelastic scatterings with the medium, as well as
transport coefficients by using a single-hit picture, which
we can then compare to results in the literature.
Typical time-dependent observables that we consider
are the average transverse and longitudinal momenta
squared of the jet, which quantify momentum broadening

(see also Section [IV)
((Ap.)’),

((Ap))2), (i?) (10)
Here, we have decomposed the momentum p into its part
parallel and transverse to the propagation of the minijet
initiator, p = py +p1, where p- pp = pj, and p, -po = 0.
The transverse momentum with respect to po is then

broadening.
B. Collisional expansion and transport coefficients

The linearized QCD kinetic theory can be used to re-
define jet transport coefficients as single-hit observables
and numerically compute them. To achieve this, we ex-
pand the jet distribution in the number of collisions, such
that

fe = fo + 5fO 4... (11)
The first two orders are given by

asf =0,

af? = 6Ci[{n, 6f}, way
where 5f) is the free propagation of the initial pertur-
bation, which is constant in the non-expanding thermal
case 5 f(t, p) = Ofi(t=to, p). Then, 6f describes the
distribution of particles after one collision (including elas-
tic and inelastic processes). Similar to the zeroth order,
0,6f™ is time independent for our spacetime indepen-
dent distributions n and 6f©) given by Eq. &.

The expansion has been previously referred to as
“opacity expansion” with the first orders forming the
“single-hit” approximation (5T) [52]. We note, how-
ever, that strictly speaking, a single hit of the medium
refers to sufficiently hard medium particles with momenta
k ~ T. In our approach, the linearized collision kernels go
slightly beyond it as they contain HTL-resummed prop-
agators, which is consistent with the kinetic evolution
of the medium. Understanding jet observables within
the EKT framework and in its opacity expansion aligns
well with recent theoretical developments in jet quench-
ing [53}56] and with the isolation of the single/multiple
scattering regimes in phenomenological applications [57+
and experimentally [61] [62].

Using the single-hit formulation (12) of the expectation
values (9) indicated as (-)“), we can conveniently define
different transport coefficients and express them in terms
of our collision kerneld2]

Thus, we have defined the jet quenching parameter g1
and the longitudinal jet quenching parameter qj (qx)
through transverse and relative (absolute) longitudinal
momentum broadening of the initial perturbation. Fol-
lowing Ref. [12], we have also defined the longitudinal
drag coefficient np and the conversion rate T';,. Note
that the collisional energy loss coefficient é is closely re-
lated but not identical to the drag coefficient 7p, because
most (but not all) of the energy loss of the jet will origi-
nate from the change in the longitudinal momentum. In
leading-order kinetic theory, where inelastic processes are
strictly collinear, the contribution to np and é from these
processes is identical (up to the factor (pj)). This is only
approximately true for the elastic processes. Thus, the
only differences between é and —(pj)np must be due to
elastic collisions.

oe general expressions for the expectation values
Eq. in the single-hit approximation are detailed in
SectionfJand have been partially used in linearized QCD
kinetic theory frameworks before [47] {6368}. Since the
elastic matrix element and the tie le rate entering the
collision kernels also depend on the medium, they in-
clude terms that additionally contribute to the linearized
expressions. However, ah are multiplied by the loss-
minus-gain structures (4) and ( (6), which vanish in ther-
mal equilibrium te Ge as in our case. We emphasize
that, in contrast, in an evolving medium (cf. [34]), this
needs to be taken into account, which modifies the usual
expressions for transport coefficients.
In the following, we provide simple approximate ex-
pressions for the transport coefficients to illustrate their
main contributions and properties. For ¢,, inelastic col-
lisions 6C1*? do not change the transverse momentum
within a single scattering event, and one only needs to
take elastic scatterings JC??? into account. Aligning po
with the z-axis (po,1 = 0) leads to p>. = (psin@)°, where
@ is the polar angle, and assuming po > T' yields the

Similar approximate formulae can be derived for other
transport coefficients, where in general both elastic and
inelastic contributions have to be taken into account.
The impact of each of the two contributions will be as-
sessed in the following subsections. Moreover, the ap-
proximate analytical expressions of the transport coeffi-
cients can be compared to the standard formulations of
the transport coefficients encountered in the literature,
as mentioned above. We will provide comparisons ana-

lytically in Section rT ¢ and numerically in Section[IIID
using the full expressions given by Eqs. to (18).

C. Difference between single-hit collision and HTL
transport coefficients

Our result in Eq. for the jet quenching parame-
ter is very similar to previous determinations of g, in
the high-temperature effective kinetic theory framework
(e.g., see [12] (69]). The only difference is
the additional term ki? — ki in Eq. (i9), which can

tions have been treated as higher-order corrections, while
here we treat them within the single-hit expansion frame-
work and show that they are non-negligible. Similar ef-
forts have been recently done in Refs. [70H74] identifying
logarithmically enhanced corrections to g,. Beyond the
single-hit limit, the Boltzmann equation re-iterates these
radiative corrections, which has become of recent inter-

Let us first discuss the jet quenching parameter in
Eq. (19) in more detail to single out the impact of the
wake. Since medium recoils are relatively soft (~ T) com-
pared to the hard initial perturbation (po >> T), we sep-
arate the momentum broadening of the jet from recoils
by introducing a lower momentum cutoff?| Amin using?

(23)

In the limit po > Amin > T, the term with k > Amin is
exponentially suppressed as ny(k >> T) — 0. Similarly,
the term that involves k’ > Amin implies ng(k’ > T) >

Even though we introduced an explicit cutoff, the addi-
tional term including k/, remains, which shows the po-
tential importance of the recoiling particles for the broad-
ening. However, this term turns out to be subdominant.
For instance, one can see this for the cutoff Amin = po/2,
where one always has O(p’ — Amin) = 1, and thus the

p’ > po/2 is large. If p! = p, then by momentum con-
servation k is also large and this region is exponentially
suppressed by the Bose-Einstein distribution n,(k). If
k' & p' & po/2, this corresponds to large momentum
exchange with a small matrix element. So indeed for
Amin = po/2 the standard expression Eq. i
ered. However, we emphasize that for a general cutoff
Amin, this is not guaranteed and the more general form

ollowing our analytical and numerical results for differ-
ent cutoffs Amin.

D. Comparison to kinetic theory simulations

Having discussed the analytical expressions for the
ransport coefficients, we now present our numerical re-
sults computed using kinetic theory simulations of a mini-
jet evolution and a direct Monte-Carlo evaluation of the
corresponding single-hit formulas Eqs. to (is). As
discussed in the previous section, the traditional defini-
ions of transport coefficients neglect the low momentum
medium recoil, while EKT evolves partons at all momen-
um scales. Therefore, it is natural to introduce a low
momentum cutoff Ayin as in Eq. to distinguish the
minijet contribution from the plasma and to study how
he transport coefficients depend on it.

In kinetic theory simulations, we therefore initialize a
gluon minijet with energy E = 50T as a narrow Gaussian
erturbation with the width 0 = 0.005F centered around
Po = (0,0, E)

(20)? py _(w=m0)?

For 0 — 0, the perturbation Eq. corresponds to
the d-distribution in the corresponding initial condition
Eq. for our semi-analytical calculations. The ini-
tial number and energy densities are indeed given by
dno = evgT?Erf(E/(V2c))  evgT?, and deg = 6TP° =
evgET?.

In Fig. we show the results for the transverse
momentum broadening coefficient ¢1 (Amin) for differ-
ent coupling constants A = 2,5,10,20 and IR cutoffs
0 < Amin < 257 = E/2. We scale out the leading cou-
pling dependence and plot the ratio ¢, /A?.. The bands
correspond to the statistical uncertainty of ten EKT sim-
ulations, where we evaluate the EKT collision kernel for
a single time step and compute the transverse momen-
tum broadening with a given cutoffP] The small value
of ¢ = 0.005 requires a fine discretization of the mo-
mentum grid, which is discussed in Section [E] We have
tested the convergence of our results for different values
of o and various grid discretizations.

The points in Fig. [I] correspond to the single-hit eval-
uation of transport integrals, Eq. (22), for which the sta-
tistical uncertainty is negligible. For delta-like minijets,
the collinear splittings do not contribute to transverse
momentum broadening. For the gaussian approximation
of the minijet used in kinetic simulations, the collinear
splitting contribution reduces with decreasing width o
and vanishes in the limit ¢ + 0 (not shown). For a more
direct comparison between the two methods, we explic-
itly turned off the inelastic processes to obtain Fig

First, one observes in Fig. [ijthat G1 (Amin) scales only
approximately with \, as the coupling enters the screen-
ing of the matrix elements, such that larger screening ef-
fects lead to smaller values of g, /\?. We see a clear two-
stage dependence on the IR cutoff Amin. For small cut-
offs, the broadening of the medium recoil partons leads
to an increase of the q, values. For larger IR cutoffs,
momentum broadening slowly decreases and approaches
the standard values of g, in Eq. or the cutoffs
Amin ~ E/2. The kinetic and single-hit values produce
the same qualitative dependence on the cutoff and agree
well for the momentum cutoffs Ayin 2 107. For smaller
cutoffs we observe systematically ~ 20% larger values
for EKT simulations than from the direct evaluations.
In principle, for narrow gaussian perturbations ¢ > 0,
the two approaches should be equivalent. However, the
EKT simulations require sufficient momentum discretiza-
tion to resolve the minijet perturbation, and it becomes
numerically challenging to take this limit. As discussed
in Section [E] we have performed a systematic variation
of the simulation parameters, but were not able to make
the two computations completely overlap. We note that
other transport coefficients seem to be less sensitive and
show better agreement with direct computations even at
low Amin-

The lower panel shows the relative contribution of

Next, we turn to longitudinal broadening. Since the
initial perturbation carries a large longitudinal momen-
tum, two types of transport coefficients can be distin-
guished: broadening relative to the initial jet momen-
tum and the absolute longitudinal broadening, charac-
terized by qj) and g,, respectively, as also distinguished

in Eq. (0)

In Fig.|2| we show the relative longitudinal broadening
coefficient qj (Amin) as a function of the IR-cutoff Ain for
different couplings. The collinear processes significantly
modify the longitudinal momentum and are therefore in-
cluded in this computation. In the lower panel, we show
the relative contribution of inelastic processes to qj. For
small cutoffs Amin < 2.57, the soft collinear radiation
fully dominates and we observe large positive values of
q, which reduce drastically for larger cutoffs. We em-
phasize that even at these larger cutoffs, the inelastic
processes contribute more than half of the total relative
longitudinal broadening. We note that qj scales well with
\? and shows good agreement between EKT and single-
hit computations.

Finally, in Fig. [3| we show the absolute longitudinal
broadening coefficient Gz (Amin) as a function of the IR-
cutoff Amin. Note that here we consider the change of the
absolute width (Pj); which is initially finite and large.

Since energy is transported to lower momenta, (pi) de-
creases and gy, is negative. Furthermore, for larger Amin,
we integrate over a smaller phase space around the initial
perturbation and more energy flows to lower momenta
p< Amin. Therefore, we observe an increase of |gz| with
Gi < 0 for larger Amin. We also find a similar ordering
of the absolute values |@;,|/A? that grow for smaller cou-
plings as for g, in Fi We note that independently of
the cutoff, the inelastic processes contribute more than
half to this transport coefficient, as shown in the lower
panel. Overall, we see a good agreement between kinetic
and single-hit computations within statistical uncertain-
ties.

Finally, in Fig. 4 we show results for the drag coef-
ficient 7p(Amin) given by Eq. ; which measures the
longitudinal momentum loss. Due to momentum con-
servation, the net longitudinal momentum is conserved
yielding 7p(Amin=0) = 0. For larger cutoffs, more mo-
mentum can flow to p < Amin, and the drag increases.
From the lower panel of Fig. [4] we see that the inelas-
tic processes are the dominant source of the drag. For
small Ain, the ratio nigel: np is slightly larger than one.
Therefore, at those small cutoffs, the elastic processes
contribute negatively to the (very small) drag coefficient.
For this transport coefficient, we see a good agreement
between single-hit and EKT computations. We also com-
puted the energy loss coefficient €. However, for a narrow

lated by a jet energy factor and a minus sign (results not
shown).

In summary, we find significant cutoff dependence
of all transport coefficients, indicating a non-negligible
medium recoil contributions. For ¢, only elastic scat-

ss contribute, but other transport coefficients (see
are dominated by radiative processes (ratios
in the lower panels greater then 0.5). Therefore the com-
plete description of energy and longitudinal momentum
transport must necessarily include inelastic processes.

IV. MINIJET THERMALIZATION TIME
A. Early time behavior and g scaling

In this section, we study the relation between jet trans-
port coefficients and the thermalization time of the lead-
ing jet parton. Following [33] [37], we initialize the Yang-
Mills kinetic theory with a Bose-Einstein distribution neq
with temperature T for the background medium and add
a narrow Gaussian perturbation with the energy |po| = E
given by Eq. that initializes the linearized Boltz-
mann equation for the jet evolution. In this section,
we use initial perturbations of width o = 0.01E (see Sec-
tio for further discretization details). At late times,
the perturbation equilibrates to a boosted thermal dis-
tribution

FIG. 5. Momentum broadening (p7.) and (Pj) as a function

We scale the time with transverse and longitudinal broaden-
ing coefficients g; and gz, respectively. The gray lines show
the linear slope. The inset shows the unscaled evolution as
a function of t7’. The vertical black line indicates the time
where the minijet is within 10% deviation from the equilib-
rium value.

Correspondingly, the equilibrium number and energy
densities are dreq = v7? 67 and d€eq = 12 T3657.
Energy and momentum conservation ensures a relation
between initial and final energy densities, and we find

with the initial jet parton density dno = vel.

7 Note that the velocity term in Eq. does not contribute to
the energy density integral (or any integral even in pz).
In order to investigate the equilibration of the initial jet
erturbation, we will study its broadening in momentum
ace. In the upper panel of Fig. [5] we show the squared
ransverse momentum evolution relative to the equilib-
rium values for different couplings \. The jet perturba-
ion has an initially small transverse width, (p?)o © 0.
During the evolution, the perturbation isotropizes. In
ne inset we display the evolution of (p?.) as a function
of time in units of (constant) background temperature
T, i.e., tf. For small A, the system takes longer to reach
equilibrium. The initial increase of (p?) is well captured
by the straight line (p? ) ~ qt (dashed lines) following
ne single-hit expansion. Therefore, in the main panel of
ne figure, we rescale the time with g, computed from
Eq. (23) and shown as points in Fig. |1] for Amin = 0.
At intermediate times, inelastic pro $s will also con-
ribute and the transverse width increases at a rate faster
han the initial linear growth. We note that after rescal-
ing, all of the curves collapse onto each other at early
imes and also, remarkably, at late times. This indicates
that in our settings, the coupling dependence of the mini-
jet equilibration at all times is reasonably well captured
by the transport coefficient ¢,. We will discuss late-time
deviations not visible in Fig. [5]in the next section. Com-

ared to a previous study [37], where the late time trans-
ort coefficient 7/s was used to rescale time, the “early
ime” quantity g| provides a better description.

w

In the lower panel of Fig. [5] we show the evolution of
he longitudinal momentum. The jet perturbation has
an initially large longitudinal momentum (p?)) ~ E?,

hat rapidly decays to a thermal value. After rescaling
the time axis with the single-hit |qj|, we see a reasonably
good collapse for different couplings even for late times.
However, we note that in contrast to transverse broaden-
ing, the decrease in the squared longitudinal momentum
is dominated by the inelastic processes. Although on
the scale of Fig. [5] q describes the initial slope of the
curve reasonably well (dashed line), the curve actually
deviates from this linear behavior earlier than for trans-
verse momentum broadening. We have observed this by
considering the time dependence of the derivative of the
curve (data not shown).

Finally, in Fig. {6} we show the time evolution of the
transverse momentum squared (p?) for different jet en-
ergies E for \ = 10. The inset shows that higher-energy
jets take longer to thermalize. The parametric scaling
of the thermalization time with energy can be obtained
by considering the time it takes the initial jet to radiate
its energy away [39]. The soft splitting rate is given by

order QCD kinetic theory, the coupling constant does not
run, and the low and high momentum partons interact
with the same coupling strength. The phenomenologi-
cally favored values of 1/s ~ 0.16 correspond to a more
strongly coupled plasma (A > 20) than the phenomeno-
logically favored values of g, /T? ~ 2-10 (A~ 5-10).
This reflects the fact that higher-momentum partons in-
teract more weakly than the bulk QGP. Therefore, the jet
thermalization time obtained in Eq. is more realistic
and consistent with jet phenomenology.

B. Late time relaxation and second-order
hydrodynamics

Strictly speaking, Eq. provides only a time es-
timate of a minijet to lose most of the initial state in-
formation. The final approach to equilibrium and ther-
malization are governed by the universal hydrodynamic
relaxation applicable to any small perturbation around
equilibrium. Here, we will study the late-time approach
of minijet perturbations to equilibrium, Eq. . Inequi-
librium, the energy-momentum tensor is given by

shows the late-time evolution of longitu-
dinal and transverse pressure and momentum, all of
which asymptotically approach their equilibrium values
In the inset, we show the deviations
from equilibrium, revealing an exponential relaxation be-
havior « e~'/7®, This indicates that the late time equi-
libration of perturbations could be well described by the

10

relaxation time approximation of kinetic theory [82] [83],
which is characterized by a single relaxation time Tr. In
che legend, we show the extracted relaxation time Tr for
each observable in units of the background temperature.
The fitted values of around TrT ~ 2.9 in Fig.[7Jare similar
for both pressure and momentum observables. We note
chat the relaxation time for longitudinal and transverse
pressure are identical thanks to energy conservation and
conformality of massless kinetic theory. This does not
apply to averaged transverse and longitudinal momen-
um and we observe £

5% variation in the extracted value.
These differences might reflect the residual momentum
dependence on relaxation time in QCD kinetic theory.

The late time equilibration of the energy-momentum
censor is described by viscous hydrodynamics. In second-
order hydrodynamics, the relaxation time of spatial com-
ponents of the energy-momentum tensor is governed by
she Miiller-Israel-Stewart (MIS) equation [84]

Tens = 7 4 nit, (34)

Here 7”! is the non-ideal dissipative part of the energy-
momentum tensor, TY = 64%P +7, and 77’ is the first-
order gradient correction to the energy-momentum ten-
sor. The second-order hydrodynamic transport coeffi-
cient T; describes the relaxation of tI to the Navier-
Stokes expectation mj’, which is zero for our homoge-
neous system. T; was computed in QCD kinetic theory
at leading [66] and next-to-leading order [67]. We can
compare our extracted relaxation time Tr to the com-
puted values of 7; in 0-flavor QCD for 4 = 10, where
trl /(n/s) &% 5.2 at mp/T = V/d/3 & 1.8 in Fig. 1
in [66]. For \ = 10 the specific shear viscosity in a gluonic
plasma is 7/s + 0.513 [45], such that the extracted value
of the relaxation time corresponds to TrT'/(n/s) ¥ 5.65.
This value is in reasonable agreement (within 5%) with
the value found in the literature. Unlike the thermaliza-
tion time, Eq. the 7, does not depend on the initial
minijet energy, since such information has been lost by
the time the hydrodynamic equations become applicable.

Vv. CONCLUSION

As a high-momentum parton (minjet) traverses a high-
temperature QCD plasma, it interacts with the medium
through scatterings characterized by jet transport coeffi-
cients, such as the transverse momentum broadening 1
and drag coefficient np. In this work, we investigated
the thermalization of on-shell minijets in a weakly cou-
pled gluonic plasma using AMY kinetic simulations with
elastic scatterings and collinear radiation on a thermal
background. In particular, our implementation employs
an isotropic hard-thermal-loop (HTL) screening of soft
exchanges. Because the kinetic evolution incorporates
both elastic and inelastic processes as well as the recoil
of medium constituents from high-momentum partons,
we observe quantitative deviations between the full EKT

evolution and the standard definitions of transport coef-
ficients.

We performed a single-scattering (opacity) expansion
of the Boltzmann equation and derived general expres-
sions for the expectation values of moments of the distri-
bution function, such as the squared transverse momen-
tum (p?). By defining transport coefficients through the
time derivatives of these moments, we recover the con-
ventional expressions known from analytic treatments.
However, standard formulations of jet transport coeffi-
cients typically neglect the contributions from recoiling
medium particles and inelastic processes. Our analysis
demonstrates that these effects are quantitatively impor-
ant and must be included for a consistent description
of the minijet evolution. The transport coefficients ex-
racted from the single-hit expansion show good agree-
ment with the early-time behavior observed in full kinetic
simulations. Finally, we show that the traditional expres-
sions can be approximately recovered by introducing a
arge infrared cutoff that suppresses the recoil contribu-
ions.

We also studied the thermalization of a minijet in a
non-expanding thermal medium. The early-time evolu-
ion is well described by jet-transport coefficients, as ex-
pected. Remarkably, when the evolution time is rescaled
by these transport coefficients, most notably by the je
quenching coefficient g,, the results exhibit a univer-
sal scaling behavior across different coupling strengths
and energies, extending smoothly up to the thermaliza-
tion stage and outperforming previous rescalings based
on 7/s. From this analysis, we derived a compact phe-
nomenological formula that provides realistic estimates o
the minijet thermalization time in heavy-ion conditions.
Close to equilibrium, we confirm that the relaxation o
perturbations is consistent with second-order hydrody-
namic coefficients obtained in earlier studies.

A natural next step is to include dynamical quarks
and quark-gluon conversion channels within the same ki-
netic framework. In Section [B] we have already derived
a practical implementation of isotropic HTL screening
prescription for fermions and validated it against ana-
lytical result of gluon-quark conversion rate in Fig.
However, our preliminary attempts to extract transpor
coefficients from the linearized EKT evolution including
fermions suffer from numerical instabilities, which cur-
rently prevent a quantitative comparison with the direc
computation of transport coefficients, such as done for
the gluonic plasma in Section [TID] These instabilities
originate from the current implementation of the Monte
Carlo sampler, which does not account for the fact tha‘
minijets have very small support in the sampled phase
space. As a result, the sampling becomes highly ineffi-
cient, which is not the case for the smoother distributions
encountered near equilibrium. A revised sampling strat-
egy tailored to such extreme initial conditions could im-
prove numerical stability, which we leave for future work.

Another extension of this work is to relax the assum)
tion of a static medium. Since the QGP expands rapidly,

11

the evolving background can significantly modify the dy-
namics of minijet propagation. As discussed in [37] and
noted in this work, such dynamical effects introduce ad-
ditional linear contributions to the collision kernels that
stem from the perturbation of the (screened) matrix el-
ements. These terms also affect the transport properties
of the minijet. However, their size and form can depend
strongly on the chosen screening prescription for elastic
tterings and collinear splittings. To our knowledge,
these additional terms have not been included in previous
studies involving non-equilibrium backgrounds [45], but
are needed for a consistent linearized description of trans-
port in an expanding and dynamically evolving medium.

Finally, for an evolving anisotropic medium there are
further corrections that should be taken into account.
In particular, currently the internal soft propagators are
screened isotropically. Large momentum-anisotropy of
che non-equilibrium medium affects the collision kernels
and the underlying collinear splitting rate [86] [87]. While
previous studies within QCD kinetic theory [39} ne
glected the effect of plasma instabilities resulting from
che anisotropy [88] [89], justified by the observation that
hey do not play a dominant role in the high-occupanc
regime of the thermalization process [90] [91j, recent stu
ies have put forward suggestions of how they can be ac-
counted for in the descriptions of hard probes and kinetic
heory [92] [93]. Further studies are needed to obtain a
practical way of their inclusion in kinetic theory simula-
ions.

In summary, our work demonstrated how the simpli-
fied picture encoded in jet transport coefficients emerges
rom the full kinetic evolution of on-shell partons in the
QGP. Despite the differences in the details, we demon-
strated that ¢ scaling provides a practical mapping from
medium properties to jet quenching times. Confronting
his with system-size and energy dependencies in light-
and heavy-ion collisions can deliver tighter constraints on
jet-transport coefficients and on the onset of thermaliza-
ion in small systems.

Appendix A: Elastic and inelastic collision kernels in EKT

The Boltzmann equation can be written in the form 0;f;(p) = C;[{f}]. Then the collision kernel includes elastic
and radiative processes, C; = C?? + C}?, and is always local. The elastic collision kernel is given by [IJ]

F (pi, p2; Ps, Pa) = fe(ps) fa(pa)(1 + fa(pi))(1 + fo(p2)) — fa(pi) fo(p2)(1 + fe(ps))(1 + fa(pa)) ; (A3)

where the upper (lower) sign is used if the distribution is for bosons (fermions), which reads in equilibrium n,(p) =
1/(e?/T +1). For the matrix element, we take the scattering matrix elements in vacuum, summed over all incoming and
outgoing spin and color states, as tabulated in Ref. [IJ]. Medium effects should be included by using the resummed
hard-thermal loop propagator for the internal soft quark or gluon propagators. As argued in Ref. [I], this can be
easily incorporated by a simple replacement in the u- and ¢- channel parts of the matrix element, which we will discuss
in more detail in the next section. The radiative collision kernel is given by

F (Pi; P2,P3) = fo(P2) felps)(1 + fa(p1)) — fa(pr)L + fo(p2))(1 + fe(ps)) - (A5)

This radiation kernel describes strict collinear splitting (where all momenta are proportional to a unit vector n), and
is given by the AMY rates [11] [94], where the effective splitting matrix elements 7 are given by

2, (p;p',&) = V4, (p:p',k) = ae Fi(p,p',k), (A6)
yqq(Pip',k) = Cale Fi(k,—p',p), (A7)
Vq(Ps p's k) = (p.p',k) , (A8)
where
Fi(p,p,k) = Sot / aa =e Re F*(h;p',p,k), (A9)

and F is the solution to the integral equation

The vector h is a two-dimensional vector in the transverse plane to the direction of the splitting particles, i. The elastic
collision kernel A(q ,) encodes the broadening of hard particles during the splitting process. It can be represented as
a Wightman correlator of the gluon field generated by the hard particles moving in the plasma. With an isotropic
screening approximation, it can be simplified to the simple sum rule result [69]

Note that in practice, we do not solve Eq. (A10) directly. Instead we interpolate between the analytically known
Bethe-Heitler and Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal limits of the collinear splitting rates [3]. This reproduces well the
results of Eq. as shown in Appendix B of Ref. [50].

Throughout the paper, we use the Boltzmann equation linearized around thermal equilibrium, f = n + df, (see
Eq. (7})- The linearized collision kernels are simply given by the original ones and (A4), with replaced statistical
factors F +> 6F,

6F (p1, p2; Ps, Pa) = 5 fe(ps) [na(pa)(1 = na(p1))(1 = no(p2)) Fe Na(P1)no(p2)(1 + na(pa))

A

Additionally, the matrix element linearization can be found in [37]. We linearize around thermal equilibrium, and
thus the term with matrix-element linearization vanishes as statistical factors cancel exactly.

Appendix B: Isotropic HTL screening for soft gluon and quark exchange

Here, we describe the full HTL screening of the 2442 matrix element, and show that our implementation reproduces
the known analytical results, while the commonly used vacuum LO pQCD matrix elements with Debye-like screening
prescription are insufficient to simultaneously describe all transport coefficients. The implementation of the HTL
prescription for soft-gluon exchange has been described before [45], which we reiterate here for completeness and
extend it for soft-fermion exchange.

According to the prescription outlined in Ref. [II], for gluons, one needs to replace

While this prescription is gauge-invariant [45], we use here the form of the retarded gluon propagator in strict Coulomb

Here, Qj) and 4; are the angles between q and p or k. The angle dk (¢gp) is the azimuthal angle of k (p) in a
coordinate system where q points in the z direction and the beam axis lies in the xz plane.

To verify the correct implementation of the HTL screening, we calculate the transverse and longitudinal momentum
broadening coefficients ¢, and qj, for which screening of the soft-gluon exchange in the t-channel matrix element is
important. For that, we use the implementation [97] described in Ref. [35] for p + oo and a transverse momentum
cutoff. We compare with their analytic estimates [12] [65] (69),

For gluons, 74 = 0.38604.... In particular, for transverse momentum broadening (left panel in Figure|8), we compare
with the analytic result for small cutoffs (dashed line), and for large cutoffs (dotted line). For longitudinal
momentum broadening (right panel), we compare with Eq. (dotted line). Note that this analytic result is only
valid for small cutoffs, and deviations for larger cutoffs—as seen in the figure—are expected. For both transport
coefficients, we show both the Debye-like (orange +) and isoHTL screening prescription (blue x), where we use the
value €, = e°/6/,/8 for the Debye-like prescription [46]. This parameter is tuned to correctly reproduce the isoHTL
results for longitudinal momentum broadening, as can be seen in the right panel (resulting from an expansion of the
distribution function in w). However, it fails to reproduce the correct result for the transverse momentum broadening.
If we had chosen to use the value £4 = e'/3/2 obtained in Ref. [35], we would have found the transverse broadening
to be accurately described. We emphasize that the isoHTL screening correctly describes both of these processes and
is thus more general and should be used instead [45].

For screening soft-fermionic exchanges, we use [I]]

We used again the same integration variables that are described below[B5a} For s/u, appearing in the gg ++ qg matrix
element, the replacement is slightly different and does not amount to simply relabeling u <> t, but the differences are
negligible for small |u| < s and |Q- Q|? < sQ- Q*, where the screening is needed.

In practice, we replace (s — u)/t, which can be related to

thus,

where L = In | ata, and m= mp is the gluonic asymptotic (or effective) mass. While our definition of Q = P’ — P

differs from the one in [II] by Q# > —Q", this does not change the implementation of the screening prescription. It
would reverse w —> —w and 5? — —D3. The latter implies a sign change in Fy and of the parenthesis in F3. The w
change is straightforward and amounts to w + —w. Also note that L + —L. Overall, this results in a sign change in
F, and F3, which only appear in pairs or squared, thus not affecting the result in Eq. (BI).

For verifying the fermionic HTL implementation, we compare our numerical results of the conversion rate to the

energies and small cutoffs j. and our implementation (for finite p) is only valid for large jet energies p >> T. The results
of this comparison are shown in Figure[9} with the + signs from the Debye-like screening prescription and the crosses
showing the HTL prescription. It can be seen that the Debye-like screening agrees well with the isoHTL screening.
This is because this process was used to fix the parameter €, in the Debye-like screening prescription [12] [41]. While
in Fig. i} we use p = 507’, we have checked that p > 10 leads to the same numerical results, when rescaled with p.

Appendix C: Expectation values in the single collision limit

The expectation value of a general observable O(p, i) is
=r" [ oe. dO f(p.t), (cl)

where f is the solution of the Boltzmann equation. Note that, relative to Eq. (9). one has to divide by the initial
density, which is v;,¢T° for a delta perturbation. We saw examples for O in the main text and here we are focusing
on its evaluation in the single collision limit. Following Eq. (12), its rate takes the form

Appendix D: Numerical implementation of the single-collision limit
Here, we discuss how the integral (C5) is performed. The integral measure can be rewritten similarly as in Ref. [35],

Pp2p3pa

We have used the symmetry p! <> k’ in the integrand (also present in (C5)) to always enforce p’ > k’. Otherwise,
the lower boundary of the w-integral would be —p, and the prefactor 1/(8p(27)°)). The reason for this choice is that
then only the t channel diagrams need to be screened (5). For a finite momentum grid pmin < p < Pmax, on which
the distribution function is stored, we require k to be on the grid, and k’ > pyin, which results in

This integration measure is used in Eq. together with the matrix elements tabulated in Ref. [35], with screening
prescriptions and (B11) to obtain the expectation values in the single collision limit. Similar as in Ref. B35],
the five-dimensional integral is evaluated using Monte Carlo integration with importance sampling. The kinematic
variables need to be expressed in terms of the integration variables. The Mandelstam variables are given by

t
t=w? — 9, u , (( + p'\(k +k’) — q? — /(4pp! + t)(ARk +0) 08 bg) ‘ s=-t—u, (D3)

where k’ = k —w, and p' = p+w. We also need to express p = (0,0,p), k, k’, and p’ in the frame defined by the
direction of propagation of the jet,

and k’ = k —q, and p' = p+q. In our implementation of Eq. (C5), we included both the gain and loss term and
verified that for all observables considered in this paper, the gain term is negligible.

To compare with the analytic expression for the conversion rate (BI7}. we need to additionally implement a
momentum cutoff on —t = q? — w? < y? [2]. This changes the upper boundary of the q-integral to min(2p + w, 2k —
w, \/w? + pi).

For the inelastic collision term the kinematics is simpler. Getting rid of the delta function there, only one
integral needs to be performed numerically, for which we use both the trapezoidal and Simpson’s rule, and use their
difference as an error estimate. Compared to simulating the time evolution of minijets [37], the evaluation of these
integrals is fast and the error can be easily reduced by a finer momentum grid.

Appendix E: Numerical convergence of collision kernel evaluation in EKT

In this section of the Appendix, we discuss the numerical setup needed for the evolution of a minijet from which
we compute the transport coefficients in Section [I We will demonstrate numerical convergence for the transport
coefficient Gi (Amin) (Eq. Computing the transport coefficients from the minijet evolution, using Eq.
evaluated after one time step, is numerically challenging due to the fact that the initial condition is representing a
delta-like perturbation. We use spherical coordinates to discretize our grid in momentum space, so we consider the
magnitude p, the polar angle v, = cos@ and the azimuthal angle ¢. In all our computations we assume azimuthal
symmetry. Importantly, we have pz = puvz and p, = py/1 — v3. For the p-discretization we use a linear grid with N,
grid points with grid spacing Ap = (pmax — Pmin)/Np. For the angle v, = cos @ we use a logarithmic grid with N,
erid points. Namely, we discretize w(vz) = log(1 + v? — vz) linearly, where v9 is a small offset so that the logarithm
is well defined. We choose v? = 10-7. The number of grid points for the angle is denoted by N,..

In order to solve for the time evolution of the minijet in Eq. we have to calculate the linearized collision
kernel on the right-hand side. For one time step, this is equivalent to computing Eq. (12). For the evaluation of the
multidimensional integral, we use Monte-Carlo integration. The total number of samples Ngampies chosen to execute
he integration differs between the elastic kernel in Eq. and the inelastic one in Eq. @. For the inelastic kernel
we choose Nee = K x N, whereas for the elastic one we have BE es = K x N, x Nv,, where K is some large
factor. This is because in our leading order framework, the splittings are strictly collinear, and we need to sample
over a smaller phase Eve containing only the momentum p and not the angle vz. For minijet results in Section [ITD]

(bands in Figs. [i]to we choose N, = 1000 and N,, = 300 and the sampling multiplier K = 2- 10+.
In order to show that ¢1 has reached numerical convergence, we consider various widths o of the initial Gaussian.
Sharper peaks require finer grids which amounts to increasing N,. For large Np, the grid spacing scales Ap/T ~ 1/Np.
For each setting we ensure that 1/N, < o/T. For the angle, we choose a logarithmic grid to ensure that the angular
discretization around the initial peak is very fine, i.e., the angular grid spacing goes Av, ~ v2/N,. < o/T (cf.
For this reason, we will use the same v,-discretization of N,, = 300 for all of the curves.
We compute ¢1 (Amin) for four different widths o, successively increasing N, and K. This is shown in Fig.
The first curve for ¢ = 0.01E (blue) lies below the rest of the curves. By going to smaller o, the value of ¢1 (Amin
approaches the one we show in Fig. [I] for A= 10. In particular, this holds for all Ain, with the same conclusion that
he single-step evolution results are systematically larger than the single-hit values at low cutoffs. So in Fig: [1] to [4]
he default width we are using is ¢ = 0.0052.
we consider long time EKT evolution for perturbations with o = 0.01E, until the perturbation
reaches equilibrium. In this case, we used a different grid discretization. To have good resolution for small momenta
p ST we used logarithmic discretization in p. At late times the distribution approaches isotropy, therefore we used
inearized discretization in v,. The grid parameters for these simulations are N, = 150, Ny, = 150 and K = 120.
Although the K factor is much smaller than in a single-step simulations above, the average over many successive
ime-steps partially compensate for less accurate kernel integrals at each time-step.
