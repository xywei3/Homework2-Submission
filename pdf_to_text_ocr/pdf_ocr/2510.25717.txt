Action-Angle Variables in Quantum Gravity

Jarmo Makela*

October 30, 2025

Abstract
We formulate an argument, based on the use of the action-angle vari-
ables and the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule, to the effect that if
there exists the smallest possible non-zero area, there also exists, for mas-
sive particles, the largest possible observable speed, which is a bit less
than the speed of light.

Keywords: action-angle variables, area spectrum

For any periodic system with m degrees of freedom and completely separable
characteristic function the action variables J, (k = 1,2,...,m) are defined as:

(1)
Ik = fv dq, (1)

where the variables q, are the coordinates of the configuration space, and the
variables p;, the corresponding coordinates of the momentum space. In Eq. (1)
we have integrated over the period of the system, assuming that the classical
equations of motion are satisfied. If we take the action variables J, as the co-
ordinates of the momentum space, then the so-called angle variables wz € [0, 1]
are the corresponding coordinates of the configuration space, and there exists a
canonical transformation from the phase space coordinates (qx, px) to the new
phase space coordinates, the action-angle variables (w,;, J,). In the old quantum
theory, which prevailed before the discovery of quantum mechanics around the
year 1926, one postulated the so-called Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule:

Jp = 2rngh, (2)

where ny, = 0,1,2,..., for all & = 1,2,...,m. As it is well known, the Bohr-
Sommerfeld quantization rule gives, among other things, for the one-electron
atoms an energy spectrum, which essentially agrees with the energy spectrum
obtained from the proper quantum-mechanical consideration. In the classical
limit, where the quantum numbers n; become large, the results obtained from
the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule generally give pretty good approxima-
tions to the spectra of the observable quantities.

It was suggested long ago by Bekenstein that the event horizon area A of
a black hole is an adiabatic invariant of the hole. Since, as it was pointed
out by Bekenstein, the action variables of any periodic system are its adiabatic
invariants, it is natural to think that A is proportional to an action variable J
of the hole. In other words, [2], [3]

A=aJ, (3)

where a is an appropriate constant. If this is the case, the Bohr-Sommerfeld
quantization rule implies that the eigenvalues of the area A are of the form:

An = 2rnah, (4)

where n = 0,1,2,.... In other words, the event horizon area of the black hole

has a discrete spectrum with an equal spacing. Such spectra for the black hole
event horizon area have been proposed by several authors on various grounds.
[4] In most approaches the area eigenvalues have been taken to be:

Ay, = 4n€}, In(2), (5)
since this is consistent with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy law. [5] In Eq. (5)
= 1.6 x 107m is the Planck length. +
In this paper we shall take Eq. (3) as a starting point, and see, where it will
take us. Unless otherwise stated, we shall always use the natural units, where
h=G=c=1. Eqs. (4) and (5) imply that in the natural units we may write:

It has been shown in several papers that from the point of view of an observer
with constant proper acceleration a, just outside of the event horizon of a black
hole we may take

a
H=2A (7)

as the Hamiltonian of the hole. [6] In Ref. [7], for instance, Eq. (7) was
obtained by means of an analysis of the properties of the Brown-York energy of
the gravitational field just outside of the horizon of spacetime, whereas in Ref.
[8] it was found by means of a systematic study of the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner
(ADM) formulation of general relativity. Eq. (6) implies that we may write the
Hamiltonian as a function of the action variable J as:
In(2

‘In loop quantum gravity the area eigenvalues of an arbitrary, spacelike two-surface are of

the form:
A= Cn >) Vipin + 1),
P

where 7 is an appropriate constant. When the quantum numbers jp = 0,1/2,1,3/2,... are
very large, the area spectrum agrees with that in Eq. (5). A modification of loop quantum
gravity, which produces Eq. (5) explicitly, has been formulated by Krasnov. [13]

and hence the corresponding angle variable w has the property:

dH(J) _ In(2)

os 4m?” (9)

where the dot means the derivative with respect to the proper time 7 of the
observer. Since the proper acceleration a is assumed to be a constant, no matter
what may happen to the black hole, we must have:

In(2)
w= 75

at+C, (10)

where C is a constant.

To understand, what Eq. (10) means, we must recall the basic properties
of the Rindler spacetime. As it is well known, Rindler spacetime is just the
ordinary, flat, two-dimensional Minkowski spacetime equipped with the Rindler
coordinates (t,x), which are related to the flat Minkowski coordinates (T,X)
such that: [9]

T = «sinh(t), (11a)
X = xcosh(t). (11b)

By means of the Rindler coordinates we may write the line element of flat
spacetime as:
ds? = —x? dt? + dx’. (12)

For an observer with constant spatial coordinate x the proper accelereration a
is a constant, and it is related to x as:

a=. (13)

For such observer the temporal coordinate t gives the boost angle. The velocity
of the observer is
v = tanh(t). (14)

The Rindler spacetime has the Rindler horizon, where x = 0. At the Rindler
horizon
T=+X. (15)

The Rindler spacetime may be used in the study of the properties of any
spacetime close to its horizon. As a four-dimensional generalization of the
Rindler spacetime we may consider spacetime equipped with the line element

/\2 .
ds* = —y dt? + a dd? + hyn dx! dy”. (16)

When obtaining this line element from the line element (12) we have first defined

y := x, and then assumed that y is a function of the new spatial coordinate

A. hyp is the metric tensor induced on the spacelike two-surface, where \ =

w
constant, and it is assumed to be a function of A, and of the coordinates y/
(j = 2,3) on this two-surface. The prime means the derivative with respect to
r.

The line element (16) approximates the line element of almost any spacetime
just outside of its horizon. It was used in Refs. [7] and [8], when obtaining Eq.
(7). For an observer with constant proper acceleration the spatial coordinates
A and x! are constants, and we have:

1
a=—. (17)
vy
Again, the time coordinate t is the boost angle of the observer.

Eqs. (16) and (17) enable us to understand the meaning of Eq. (10). For
an observer with constant spatial coordinates \ and y/ the proper time elapsed
during the lapse dt of the Rindler time t is:

1
dr = Vydt =~ dt, (18)

and since the proper acceleration a is assumed to be a constant, Eq. (10) implies:

In(2)
4n?

t+C. (19)

Hence we observe that the angle variable w agrees, up to multiplicative and
additive constants, with the boost angle of the observer. In other words, the
horizon area of the black hole and the boost angle of the observer constitute,
up to constants, a canonically conjugate pair of variables.

At this point we recall that:

O<w<l. (20)

Eq. (19) implies that the boost angle of the observer has fixed bounds. For
symmetry reasons we choose C= 5 in Eq. (19). With this choice we find,

denoting the boost angle of the observer by ¢:
Qn? Qn?

ing) = ° = ney’ (21)

The result that the boost angle of the observer has specific bounds, instead
of extending from the negative to the positive infinity, is most remarkable. It
was a simple consequence of the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule, and an
idea, first proposed by Bekenstein, that the event horizon area of the black hole
is proportional to an action variable of the system. We shall investigate the
physical implications of Eq. (21) at the end of this paper. Right now, however,
we pose a question of whether Eq. (21) is restricted just to black holes, or does
it have more general relevance in quantum gravity.

To begin with, we recall that with every point P of four-dimensional curved
spacetime we may associate a tangent space Tp, which is a flat, four-dimensional
Minkowski spacetime. In this spacetime we define vectors er, ex, ly and 13 such
that the position vector of an arbitrary point of Tp may be written as:

r= 7 cosh(gu!) er + Tsinh(du!) ex +? lo + u3 ls, (22)

where u!,u?,u° € [0,1] and the vectors er and ex have the properties:

er-er = -l, (23a)
ex-ex = l, (23b)
exer = 0. (23c)

The vectors lp and 13, in turn, are spacelike vectors orthogonal to the vectors
ey and ex. In other words:

lj-er =l)-ex =0 (24)
for all j = 2,3. We also have:
1
h-h= 5 (8 +15 — 13), (25)
where we have defined:
hg := by — 13. (26)

1

When written in terms of the coordinates 7, u!, u? and u°, the line element

of spacetime takes the form:
ds? = —dr? + 77¢? (du)? + 12 (du?)? + (23 +2 — 22) du? du? + 12 (du?)?. (27)

Our tangent space consists of a Cartesian product of a parallellogram with edge
vectors ly and 13, and of a flat spacetime with coordinates r and u!. The area
of the parallellogram is

A= : 41313 — (13 + 13 — 133)?. (28)
For an observer with constant coordinates u!,u?,u® € [0,1] 7 is the proper time
of the observer, and the observer is in a free fall. The quantity du’, in turn,
gives the boost angle of the observer. Making lz, 13 and 7 small we may make
the tangent space as small as we like.

As it is well known, there is an alternative to the standard ADM formula-
tion of general relativity, where the components gap (a,b = 1,2,3) of the metric
tensor induced on the spacelike hypersurface of spacetime, where the time co-
ordinate t = constant, are used as the coordinates of the configuraton space. In
this alternative formulation the so-called densitized triads

E} := /qEt (29)

on that hypersurface are considered as the coordinates of the configuration
space, and the quantities
I Llor_t

pl := —Ki= age Kav (30)
as the corresponding coordinates of the momentum space. [10] In Eqs. (29) and
(30) the quantities EY (a,I = 1,2,3) are the components of the triads. The
triad field Ef has the property

dab Ey Ey, = 5y5. (31)

The quantities K,, are the components of the exterior curvature tensor on the
t = constant hypersurface of spacetime. In what follows, we shall denote the
indices referring to the flat Minkowski coordinates attached to the given point
of spacetime by numbers equipped with bars.

Eq. (27) implies that we may take:

Ei = 70° (32a)
Ku=—ji1 = -7¢, (32b)
So we find:
Ei = A, (33a)
i 1

i 98
= akg, 33b
Py an” (33 )

where we have used Eq. (28). The other components of Ee and p/ will vanish in
the limit, where t — 0. Hence we observe that the area A of the parallellogram,
and the boost angle ¢ of an observer with u! = 1, multiplied by — x constitute
a canonically conjugate pair of variables. This means that the phase space in
general relativity may be spanned by the areas and the boost angles measured
in a local Minkowski system of coordinates by a freely falling observer at each
point of spacetime.
There are several approaches to quantum gravity, such as loop quantum
gravity, where the area of an arbtrary spacelike two-surface of spacetime has a
discrete spectrum. [11] If we assume that the area A of an arbitrary spacelike
two-surface is proportional to an action variable J as in Eq. (6), which means
that
J=—_A (34)
2In(2)”
then the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule (2) implies hat the area eigenvalues
are identical to those in Eq. (5). Even more interesting, however, is that the
corresponding angle variable w is related to the boost angle ¢ of the observer

2In(2) 7,
w a Pit C Ta

m2) 54.6, (35)

because the transformation from the variables (E}, pi) to the variables (w, J)

is canonical. Again, if we choose C = 3 and take into account that 0 < w <1,
we find that the boost angle ¢ has fixed bounds, such that
Qn? Qn?
= <o< a 36
In(2) ~ ve In(2) (38)
These are exactly the same bounds as in Eq. (21). Hence it appears that Eq.
(21) is a generic result, which holds not only for observers with constant proper
acceleration just outside of a horizon of spacetime, but also for observers in a
free fall.

An obvious consequence of Eq. (36) is that there exists a certain maximum
velocity, which is a bit less than the speed of light. Since between the velocity
v and the boost angle ¢ there is the relationship:

v = ctanh(¢), (37)

Eq. (36) implies that this maximum velocity is:

If a massive particle raced with this speed with a photon across a galaxy with
diameter 10° light years, it would lag less than 0.4 mm behind the photon at
the end of he race. The corresponding mazimum energy of a particle with mass
m is:

2
Emax = mc? cosh Fea 7 (39)
For a proton, for instance, this energy is around 1.1 x 10?4eV. Interestingly,
this is roughly of the same order of magnitude as has been the highest energy
ever measured for the particles of the cosmic rays, or (3.2+0.9) x 10?°eV. It is
still uncertain, what this so-called ”Oh-My-God-particle” really was, but it is
believed to have been a proton. [12|

A natural interpretation of our results is that it is impossible for an observer
to detect massive particles with velocities greater than Umax in Eq. (38) or with
energies greater than Emax in Eq. (39). In a nutshell, the content of this paper
may be summarized such that if there exists the smallest possible area, then
there also exists the largest possible speed, which is a bit less than the speed of
light. When drawing this conclusion we used an argument based on Bekenstein’s
idea that the black hole event horizon area is proportional to an action variable
of the system. It was found that the area A and the boost angle ¢ of an observer
with constant proper acceleration just outside the horizon, multiplied by -¢,
constitute a canonical pair of variables. Since the angle variable w € [0,1] and
the action variable J constitute a canonical pair of variables, ¢ equals with w
up to multiplicative and additive constants, and has therefore fixed bounds.
Similar results were found for freely falling observers.

Since the boost angle and the area are, up to a constant, canonically conju-
gate variables, the question about the possible Lorentz invariance of the maxi-
mum speed of massive particles is closely related the question about the Lorentz
invariance of the minimum area in quantum gravity. It was suggested by Rov-
elli and Speziale in Ref. [14] that local Lorentz boosts change the probability
distribution of the measured area eigenvalues of spacelike two-surfaces, but not
the area eigenvalues themselves. In this sense the minimum area in quantum
gravity is Lorentz invariant. It appears to the author that if one accepts the
reasoning in Ref. [14], one is also forced to accept the Lorentz invariance of the
maximum speed. In other words, the maximum speed of massive particles is
given by Eq. (38) for all observers.
