Abstract

Stacking two-dimensional (2D) layered materials offers a powerful platform to
engineer electronic and magnetic states. In general, the resulting states — such
as Moiré magnetism - have a periodicity at the length scale of the Moiré unit
cell. Here, we report a new type of magnetism - dubbed a super-Moiré mag-
netic state, which is characterized by long-range magnetic textures extending
beyond the single Moiré unit cell - in twisted double bilayer chromium triiodide
(tDB CrIg). We found that at small twist angles, the size of the spontaneous
magnetic texture increases with twist angle, opposite to the underlying Moiré
periodicity. The spin-texture size reaches a maximum of about 300 nm in 1.1°
twisted devices, an order of magnitude larger than the underlying Moiré wave-
length, and vanishes at twist angles above 2°. Employing scanning quantum spin
magnetometry, the obtained vector field maps suggest the formation of antifer-
romagnetic Neel-type skyrmions spanning multiple Moiré cells. The twist angle
dependent study combined with large-scale atomistic simulations suggests that
complex magnetic competition between the Dzyaloshinskii—Moriya interaction,
magnetic anisotropy, and exchange interactions controlled by the relative rota-
tion of the layers produces the topological textures which arise in the super-Moiré
spin orders.

and magnetic interactions|22—24]. In particular, stacking layered 2D materials with a
small relative twist angle leads to the formation of Moiré superlattices, which can dra-
matically alter the electronic band structure and give rise to a wide range of emergent

phenomena— including correlated insulating states, topological phases, sw
tivity, and magnetism [25, 26]. In twisted 2D magnetic bilayers, both theo:

quantum microscopy was utilized to directly visualize Moiré magnetism
stacking-dependent antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM)

twisted bilayer and double trilayer Crl3.

While previous theoretical and experimental studies have primarily focusec
interactions confined within a single Moiré unit cell, this framework may no longer

suffice when additional interactions are present. In multilayer Moiré he

for example, the interference of two distinct Moiré patterns can produce a secon
periodicity—known as a super-Moiré potential—with a characteristic length scale
larger than either Moiré lattice [38-40]. In twisted magnetic bilayers, magnetic

tures are typically understood in terms of interlayer interactions con
single Moiré unit cell. However, additional contributions—such as intral!
and interface-driven magnetic interactions—can strongly compete with

coupling[22-24]. These competing effects have been previously considered only wi
the Moiré unit cell, where the magnetic textures are assumed to strictly follow the

underlying lattice modulation. However, as the twist angle increases,
cell becomes progressively smaller, forcing all magnetic interactions in
fined region. In such a regime, it becomes conceivable that the magne

Here, we employed nitrogen vacancy (NV) scanning microscopy to explore

nanoscale magnetic responses of devices at various twist angles (<2°). No

Moiré stacking as suggested by earlier reports[35, 36]. Instead, we identified super-
length scale of hundreds
of nanometers, far exceeding the lattice Moiré length scale of a few tens of nanome-

Moiré antiferromagnetic orders with a large characteristic

ters. These super-Moiré patterns are driven by complex magnetic compe

contrast with previous reports, where the super-Moiré poten

ition, in

ials arise from the inter-

tilayer heterostructures.
More importantly, our observations suggest the presence of antiferromagnetic (AFM)
skyrmions in tDB Crl3 after a field-cooling process. The vector field maps provide
strong evidence of Neel-type skyrmions, marking the first experimental observation of
such topological textures in any twisted two-dimensional magnetic system to date.
Extended Ferromagnetic Domains

Our magnetic systems consisted of two sheets of bilayer CrI3 with small twist angles, as
illustrated in Fig. la. These twisted samples were fabricated using the ” tear and stack”
technique[42] in an argon glovebox and were fully encapsulated with approximately
10 nm hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flakes to prevent oxidation (More information
about the sample devices on Supplementary Section 15-17). As a result of the twist, the
local stacking of layers in tDB CrI3 alternates between monoclinic and rhombohedral
configurations, leading to periodically modulated magnetic couplings. Specifically, the
inner two layers (layers 2 and 3) exhibit alternating ferromagnetic (FM, rhombohedral
stacking) and antiferromagnetic (AFM, monoclinic stacking) coupling. Meanwhile, the
interlayer interactions J, of the outer bilayers (e.g., layers 1 and 2; layers 3 and 4)
are naturally antiferromagnetic. The intralayer interactions Jj of all four layers are
expected to be ferromagnetic. At near-zero twist angles, the FM and AFM order
regions are well separated with each other within the Moiré unit cell because the
Moiré wavelength is large, as shown in Fig. 1b. In this regime, a < ayy, with a and
am denoting the length scale of magnetic texture and Moiré wavelength, respectively.
The magnetic texture at this small angle limit is well-described by a single-Moiré-cell
model, with the magnetization strictly following the underlying Moiré superlattice
stacking configuration and with sharp transitions between domains.

At a large twist angle, magnetic competition emerges as regions favoring interlayer
FM and AFM coupling are brought closer together within a single Moiré cell, as shown
in Fig. lc. In this regime, a > ays. Therefore, a rich landscape of magnetic phases
can arise featuring emergent magnetization patterns, extended domain walls, and non-
collinear spin orders that span multiple Moiré cells. We performed le SC
simulations of tDB CrI3 with a record size of 450 nm, which consider only magnetic
competition between J, and J. At 0.5°, in one of the 4 layers, the simulations revealed
large magnetic domains that span several Moiré unit cells (Fig.1d-f; see Supplemen-
tary Section 19 for simulation details). As the twist angle is increased to 1.1°, these
domains expanded, and at 2°, the magnetization becomes nearly uniform across the
entire 450 nm simulation area. Such angle-dependent behavior is opposite to the pre-
dictions of the single Moiré model, which anticipates shrinking magnetic textures with
increasing twist angles. Instead, strong magnetic competition stabilizes domains with
sizes larger than the Moiré unit cell. Moreover, the presence of Dzyaloshinskii—Moriya
interactions (DMI) and dipolar interactions induces canting in the spin configuration,
resulting in extended magnetic textures. In particular, the uniform DMI induced by
the hBN/Crl; interface promotes the formation of Néel-type structures with length
scales above 100 nm. The interplay between these competing magnetic interactions
is crucial for stabilizing noncollinear and topological magnetic structures that exceed
the Moiré length scale, as illustrated in Fig. 1g.

To probe the underlying magnetic textures in tDB CrI3, we utilized NV scanning
microscopy (see Supplementary Section 1)[43]. Previous reports have shown that this
technique offers a sensitivity of a few wT/VHz and a spatial resolution limited only
by the spacing between the NV center and the magnetic samples. Compared to con-
ventional optical approaches, NV scanning microscopy offers significantly improved
spatial resolution, and also allows direct reconstruction of local magnetization from

detected stray field, as demonstrated in Fig. 2a and 2b. All measurements are per-
formed at 4 K unless otherwise stated. From the magnetization maps of small-angle
twisted (< 2°) samples (magnetization reconstruction is discussed in Supplementary
Section 2), we distinguish two categories of magnetic response in the twisted regions:
FM domains with a magnetization of approximately 30 zp /nm? and AFM domains
with a magnetization near 0 jzg/nm? (see also Supplementary section 11). The uni-
form magnetization of ~ 30 p/nm? across the majority of FM regions corresponds
to a net two-layer magnetization of CrI3[28, 44]. Both FM and AFM domains are
strongly pinned by local defects and remain stable over multiple thermal cycles.

Despite the Moiré wavelengths at larger twist angles potentially being smaller than
our scanning resolution of 30 nm, the detected FM domain magnetization significantly
exceeds the expected maximum of 12 jxg/nm? based on a Moiré unit cell model[35-
37]. From our angle-dependent study (discussed in Supplementary Section 3 and 4),
we find that the ratio of FM to AFM domains follows a similar trend to earlier RMCD
measurements[35], exhibiting maximum FM response in samples twisted by 1.1°. We
also notice a finite domain wall width between FM and AFM domains that is well
above the spatial resolution of 30 nm, contrasting with the narrow domain wall width of
below 10 nm expected in the single Moiré model. The domain wall width also exhibits
clear twist angle dependence, as illustrated in Fig. 2c. We identified the largest domain
wall width of +118 nm in 1.1° twisted samples, which are predicted to exhibit the
largest FM responses and noncollinear features. The domain wall length far exceeds
the Moiré wavelength of the corresponding twist angle, which suggests that magnetic
domains cannot be simply relaxed within a single Moiré cell. This is also captured in
our atomic spin simulations, where no magnetic texture exists within a single Moiré
cell at 1.1°.

Emergence of Long-range Antiferromagnetic Textures

In addition to the ” uniform” FM domain shown in Fig. 2a and 2b, we noticed small
varying features inside these domains, which are shielded behind a strong stray field
gradient generated from the FM-to-AFM domain boundaries. By applying a 3rd order
polynomial background subtraction to eliminate the domain boundary field for the
magnetic texture in Fig. 2b, we observed weak textures of about 100 wT, as shown in
Fig. 2d (more details in Supplementary section 5). To confirm the underlying length
scale, the autocorrelation of the 2D stray field map is computed:

AC(Ax, Ay) = S> M(x, y)M(« + Ac,y + Ay) (1)
ry

where M(x, y) is the value of the 2D field map. This serves to reduce random noise
caused by disorder and to enhance the underlying correlation in 2D maps [28, 45]. The
autocorrelation of the field map reveals hexagonal magnetic textures with a length
scale reaching 340 nm, 9.3 times greater than the expected Moiré magnetic wavelength
of 36.4 nm for 1.1° twisted samples, giving a/aj,y ~ 9.3. Given the measured field
strength, we attributed these observed textures to non-collinear AFM orders within
one bilayer, coexisting with a uniform FM response in the other bilayer. Additionally,
similar weak magnetic textures were also observed in the FM region of 0.5° twisted

a
samples with a length scale of 173 nm, giving a/ay ~ 2.4 (Supplementary section
5). Interestingly, there is an inverse dependence of the magnetic length scale a on the
underlying Moiré wavelength ayy.

A similar analysis can be applied to the AFM domains, as shown in Fig. 3. In
this case, no background stray field subtraction is needed. In a 0.5° twisted sample,
we observed a weak magnetic response at zero field cooling (ZFC) with stripe-like
patterns in the AFM domains (Fig. 3a), suggesting the presence of AFM textures
within twisted double bilayer regions. The autocorrelation of a selected area revealed
a unilateral correlation in one direction (Fig. 3b). In contrast, no specific patterns
are observed in the natural bilayer and 4-layer regions (Supplementary section 9). To
enhance magnetic ordering, we applied field cooling at 0.5 T, a process developed in
our previous twisted Crl3 experiments[28]. The observed AFM stripe-liked pattern
transformed into dot-like pattern, as shown in Fig. 3c. Performing autocorrelation on
the same selected area revealed a long-range hexagonal correlation (Fig. 3d), which
suggests that the existence of DMI energies in the system contribute to the observed
magnetic textures. We identified a wavelength of about 192 nm, giving a/ay © 2.4.
We refer to this new emergent texture of long-range magnetic order in twisted vaW
layers as ’super-Moiré magnetic texture”.

We examined AFM patterns at larger twist angles to explore the twist angle depen-
dency. At 1.1°, we measured an even larger super-Moiré textures of about 218 nm,
giving a/ajz © 6.0 as shown in Fig. 3e and 3f. To corroborate these observations, more
devices at these two angles were fabricated, consistently revealing a larger a/ayy at
1.1° than at 0.5° (Supplementary section 6). A similar trend has also been observed
for the super-Moiré patterns in the FM regions of the sample, as discussed in the
supplementary material. At angles greater than 1.1°, the expected Moiré periodicity
becomes smaller and noncollinear effects diminish, as also shown earlier[35], leading
to no discernible magnetic textures in 2° twisted samples (Supplementary section 10).

Super-Moiré Antiferromagnetic Skyrmions

With temperatures increasing from 4 K to 35 K, these super-Moiré patterns in
the twisted sample remain robust, preserving their super-Moiré wavelength despite
changes in temperature, as shown in Fig. 4a-d. The contrast of higher-order peaks
became more prominent due to the reduction of the critical field at elevated temper-
atures. Furthermore, these super-Moiré patterns were robust against magnetic fields,
with the features becoming more prominent at higher applied fields (Supplementary
section 7). These signatures confirm the emergence of robust noncollinear magnetic
textures with AFM orientations. Here, the Moiré lattice and substrate effects can
break the intrinsic symmetry of CrI3, introducing Moiré and substrate DMI, and mod-
ulate the energy difference between various spin configurations. Under such conditions,
the system can favor the formation of hexagonal patterns with skyrmion lattices. A
more quantitative analysis of various magnetic energies, including magnetic anisotropy,
exchange interaction, dipolar interaction and DMI, is presented in Supplementary
Section 19, where isolated skyrmions and other main features such as extended
AFM-type magnetic textures can emerge. However, due to the significantly increased

complexity for larger simulation domains, the current simulation model(27, 33] can-
not incorporate magnetic relaxation and complex lattice relaxation[46, 47], such as
magneto-elastic coupling[48-50] and periodic lattice distortions[51], which are typi-
cally observed in actual twisted systems. Such lattice relaxations can also contribute
to the formation of super-Moiré skyrmion lattices through the strong modulation of
competing energies, requiring further theoretical studies of the lattice relaxation in
magnetic systems.

To further confirm the topological nature of the skyrmion, we conducted zoom-
in scans on several of these small magnetic features. A representative scan is shown
in Fig. 4 fh. The vector magnetic fields (B,, By, and B,) were derived from the
stray field map (Byy) detected by the NV probe (See also Supplementary section
2 and 12). Each single dot-like feature exhibits spin configurations consistent with
Néel skyrmions[52], which are also observed in the simulation result shown in Fig.
4 e. Atomic-scale simulations spanning 450 by 450 nm revealed that isolated Néel
skyrmions can form within twisted samples. It is important to note that the skyrmions
exhibit variations in size and shape, which we attribute to local strain and Moiré
disorder in the twisted samples. Such skyrmion lattices may contribute to a topological
magnetic response, and the same region also exhibits a magnetic signal in RMCD
measurements (see Supplementary Fig. $30). This, in turn, could account for the
observations in earlier RMCD and MOKE measurements, in addition to the net FM
domains [53, 54]. To the best of our knowledge, our observations represent the first
visualization of skyrmion features in twisted 2D systems.

Discussion

In summary, we have utilized state-of-the-art scanning quantum microscopy to explore
the nanoscale magnetic responses of tDB CrI3. Moving beyond the conventional frame-
work of Moiré magnetism, we identified super-Moiré antiferromagnetic order at small
twist angles (e.g., 0.5°, 1.1°), arising from the interplay between the twisted Moiré
potential and complex magnetic competition. More importantly, we uncovered the
emergence of super-Moiré magnetic textures with inverse dependence as the underly-
ing Moiré wavelength, as well as the signatures of Néel-type skyrmions, which have
not been reported in any twisted magnetic systems to date. These long-range mag-
netic textures can also appear in twisted double trilayers (Supplementary section 10)
and may even be present in more general twisted devices, reshaping earlier theoret-
ical models [27, 30]. These call for further investigation to unravel the emergence of
super-Moiré magnetic textures and other stacking-related behaviors, such as locally
enhanced transition temperatures[44, 55] and rotational stacking faults which affect
spin ordering[56].

Our observations also enrich the understanding of 2D magnetism, in which strong
magnetic anisotropy was believed to be required to stabilize long-range magnetic
order, conditions generally considered unfavorable for the formation of magnetic
textures such as skyrmion lattices. However, in twisted systems, the Moiré effect
introduces intense magnetic competition that not only stabilizes topological spin
textures, but also preserves local single-ion anisotropy, thereby reconciling these con-
tradictory requirements. Moreover, this non-dependence of anisotropy for long-range
ordering confirms early predictions[57] where fundamental interactions (e.g., isotropic
exchange) are sufficient to create robust magnetism in 2D (Supplementary section 19).
In addition, our investigations can be generalized to a range of 2D magnetic families
(CrBr3, CrCl3, CrSBr, Fe;GeTez, etc.) [58-66] which host very different interaction
strengths and symmetries. Moiré engineering provides unconventional tuning knobs
to manipulate multiple magnetic interactions with complex electronic competitions to
drive the development of skyrmionic devices[5, 16]. In this context, it may enable the
discovery of other exotic magnetic phases such as half-charge merons|7], topological
magnons|67, 68], and quantum spin liquids[69] driven by the Moiré effect.

Fig. 1 a. Schematic of the scanning quantum microscopy technique for the visualization of magnetic
textures in tDB Crl3. An NV center (red spin) is located at the apex of a diamond pillar. The NV
is initialized by a green laser and controlled by a microwave signal. The sample device consists of
two sheets of bilayer CrI3 with a twist angle 0 between them. b. Schematic of Moiré-modulated
magnetic interactions at near-zero twist angle, showing FM regions (rhombohedral stacking, shaded
red) and AFM regions (monoclinic stacking, shaded blue) are well separated. Thus, the magnetic
texture closely follows the underlying Moiré lattice, forming sharp magnetic domain walls. In this
regime, a < ayy, where a and ay denote the length scale of magnetic texture and Moiré wavelength
respectively. c. Schematic of competing magnetic orders at larger twist angles, where FM- and AFM-
favored regions shift toward AA sites. Magnetic competition drives strong noncollinear spin textures,
with magnetic domains extending beyond a single Moiré unit cell. In this regime, a > ayy. d-f.
Atomistic simulated normalized magnetization maps over a 450-nm region for twist angles of 0.5°, 1.1°,
and 2°. Only magnetic competition of J, and J\ is considered. A cross-section of the magnetization
from a single layer of the tDB CrI3 shows the merging of Moiré cells into larger magnetic textures
with increasing twist angle. White dots mark the positions of underlying monoclinic sites for each
twist angle. g. Schematic illustration of topological magnetic textures in relation to the underlying
Moiré stacking. The arrows indicate the spin configuration in the 2D magnet, while the gray lattice
beneath represents the Moiré superlattice. The shaded holes artistically depict regions of distinct
stacking. A representative Moiré unit cell is outlined by a blue hexagon. The emergent super-Moiré
magnetic textures span multiple Moiré unit cells, with characteristic length scales exceeding 100 nm.

Fig. 2 a, b. 2D magnetization maps of tDB CrI3 at 0.5° and 1.1° twist angles, showing randomly
distributed FM and AFM domains. The FM domains have a magnetization of around 30 p/nm?,
while other regions are all nearly 0 zz /nm?. c. Representative FM domain wall linecuts of 0.5° (red
dots) and 1.1° (black dots) of tDB CrI3 samples, fitted with a hyperbolic tangent function (red and
black lines). The fitting for 0.5° and 1.1° linecuts showed domain wall widths of 58.5 nm and 118.2
nm. Positions of the linecuts are denoted on (a,b) as white dashed lines. A domain wall linecut from a
twisted bilayer Crl3 (dashed grey line) serves as a reference for minimum resolvable domain wall width
of around 30 nm. See supplementary section 3 for more statistics and discussion. d. Stray field map of a
selected FM area (black dashed rectangle) in (b), after a smooth polynomial background subtraction,
showing correlated field variation features within FM domains. e. 2D autocorrelation of the field
map of (d), revealing hexagonal textures with correlation length in the long edges around a=340 nm,
exceeding the Moiré magnetic periodicity of 36.4 nm at a 1.1° twist angle, giving a/ajy ¥ 9.3. The
short edge gives a/ayy © 6.2.

Fig. 4 a. A representative stray field map of a 1.1° tDB CrI3 sample after 500 mT field cooldown,
taken at 4K, shows dot-like features in the AFM region. An area (dashed black rectangle) was selected
to perform autocorrelation at different temperatures. b-d. 2D autocorrelation of the selected area
in (a) at 4K, 25K, and 35K, respectively, demonstrating the robustness of the magnetic textures
at elevated temperature. The contrast of higher-order peaks becomes more prominent due to the
reduction of the critical field as the critical temperature is approached. The spacing of the hexagonal
features yields a ratio of a/ajy * 8.1 in the long edges and a/ajy % 6.0 in the short edge. e.
