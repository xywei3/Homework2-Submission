ABSTRACT

Spent nuclear fuel imaging before disposal is of utmost importance before long term disposal in
dedicated storage facilities. Passive Gamma Emission Tomography (PGET) is an approved method by the
International Atomic Energy Agency. The present detection system is based on small CZT detectors behind a
tungsten-based collimator consisting of a linear array of slits. Small scale CZT crystals limit the detection
efficiency of high energetic gamma rays from the fuel rods, mainly the 662 keV emissions from Cs-137. In
our study based on full Monte-Carlo simulations as well as on experiments, we explore the capabilities of
large pixelated CZT detectors to be used for PGET. We will discuss the theoretical advantages and practical
challenges of the larger crystals. We demonstrate that the larger crystals, depending on their orientation, will
increase the detection efficiency by a factor of 7 to 13. Due to the pixelated sensor signal readout we also
explore the possibility to employ Compton imaging to improve the information on the location of origin of
gamma rays.

In addition we explore the usefulness of commercial gamma-ray imagers for waste characterisation
and decommissioning. In particular we report on the performance of the GeGI imager from PHDS Co and
the H420 imager from H3D Inc in measuring nuclear waste drums at Svafo, Sweden.

especially in Finland that has taken the leading role
in developing a geological repository for the long
term storage for spent nuclear fuel. One particularly
useful device for nuclear safeguards for spent fuel
assemblies (SFA) is the Passive Gamma Emission
Tomography (PGET) device which has its
development roots back in the 1980s. In 2017 it was
approved by IAEA [1] for safeguard inspections.
However, further development of the PGET device
is ongoing. The current system is based on small
Cadmium Zinc Telluride detectors (CZT). Those are
placed precisely behind slits of a collimator made of

tungsten. Two identical collimator/detector systems
are positioned opposite each other on a rotating
platform within a watertight enclosure, submerged
underwater for scanning the fuel assemblies. The
current PGET device is shown in Figure 1. This
system is limited by the small CZT detectors with
relatively low efficiency for full gamma-ray energy
detection. This is especially crucial for imaging the
centre positions of a SFA as the typical 662 keV
gamma-rays form the centre are strongly attenuated.

The first part of this paper reports our
activities for improving the detection efficiency of
PGET by utilizing larger pixelized CZT
detectors [2]. We explore also the possibility of
applying Compton imaging for enhancing detection
efficiency and for detecting the point of origin of the
gamma emissions. We employed detailed Monte-
Carlo simulations using the GEANT4 toolkit. For
comparison we conducted tomographic scans of
mock-up fuel rods at Uppsala University.

The second part explores the capabilities for
nuclear waste characterisation of two commercial
gamma-ray imagers based on slightly different
technologies.

2 EVALUATION OF LARGE CZT
DETECTORS FOR PGET

As main objective we study whether larger
position-sensitive CZT detectors are performing
better than the small detectors in the current PGET
system in the context of SFA imaging. Note that the
large detectors will cover several slits of the
collimator with slit widths of 1.5 mm and a pitch of
4 mm. In order to be able to determine which slit the
gamma-ray passed through the detectors need to be
position-sensitive.

2.1 Simulations

We performed GEANT4-based simulations to
evaluate whether large detectors enhance the
detection performance of PGET([3]. We
implemented large CZT detectors following the
GDS-100 detector design from IDEAS AS, Norway,
and placed them behind the model of a tungsten
collimator with identical specifications of the PGET
device. Figure 2 shows the geometry
implementation of the simulation (top left) with the
detectors positioned behind the collimator and a fuel
rod in front. Different detector configurations are
shown on the bottom row with the large CZT pixel
detectors in two different orientation on the left and
in the middle. The present configuration with small
CZTs is shown on the right side.

The fuel rod was set to emit gamma-rays at
two different energies, 662 keV and 1274 keV to
resemble Cs-137 and Eu-154 isotopes. We
generated 200 million events. The simulation was
optimised to avoid photons not interacting with our
set-up. It has to be noted that the simulation at this
stage is not a full detector simulation. Detector
efficiencies and signal digitisation are not taken into
account.

Results of the simulation are shown in
Figure 3. The energy spectrum on the top shows the
deposited energy of the 662 keV photons for the
three different detector configurations. A similar
histogram is shown on the bottom for the 1274 keV
photons. One can clearly see the increase of
efficiency using larger CZT detectors. All usual

features are shown such as the photo peak, Compton
edge as well as characteristic x-ray peaks and
annihilation peak at 511 keV in case of the 1274
keV photons. In terms of the large pixelized
crystals, orientation 1 shows a slightly higher
efficiency.

(top) and the Eu-154 1274 keV photons (bottom) for

the various detector configurations.

Quantitatively the total 662 keV (1274 keV)
gamma-ray interaction probability is about 11 (13)
and 7 (10) times higher for the larger crystals in
orientation 1 and 2 respectively compared to the
smaller crystals. This is due to the larger detector
thickness for the detector orientation 1 (22 mm)
compared to case 2 (10 mm) in the direction of the
incoming gamma-rays.

In terms of Compton imaging we looked at
events that undergo Compton scattering followed by
full photoelectric absorption of the scattered photon
elsewhere in the detector. We found out that the
fraction of these so-called golden events is up to
14% of the total number of interactions. We found
no significant difference between the two

orientations of the large crystal systems.
2.2 Tomographic Measurements

In collaboration with IDEAS we tested such a
pixelized CZT detector system on a tomographic
test bench at Uppsala University, Sweden, using
mockup fuel rods. The position-sensitive detectors
are made of 22x22x10 mm large CZT crystals with
11x11 anode pixels of 1.89 mm pitch and a planar
cathode pad. A custom-made collimator of tungsten
alloy (see drawing in Figure 2, top right) with slit
and pitch values matching the PGET device was
used. The two used mockup fuel rods contained
bronze granulate enhanced with Cs-137 confined in
a titanium tube, with an activity ratio of
0.548+0.018. The setup is shown in Figure 4. After
initial calibration data acquisition runs we took two
tomographic runs. The detector holding two crystals
(operating one crystal at time) was moved laterally
to two positions to cover the full scanning area. At
each position an additional 2mm movement was
taken to improve the position resolution due to the
4mm pitch of the collimator. The rotational stage
carrying two fuel rods was rotated in 3° steps.

Results are shown in Figure 5. The image
reconstruction is based on the filtered back
projection algorithm using the Hann filter. Due to
the different pixel pitch in comparison to the pitch
of the collimator slits, slit efficiency differences
were taken into account for the reconstruction. We
find a good agreement between measurement and
simulation also in terms of reconstructing the fuel
rod activity ratio. During data taking we suffered
from the relative high threshold of around 200 keV
on the energy reconstruction that we had to apply
due to high induced noise during data taking. This

limited the capability of probing Compton imaging
using the recorded data.

3 WASTE CHARACTERISATION
USING GAMMA-RAY IMAGERS

We performed measurements of nuclear
waste drums at Svafo, Sweden using two
commercially available gamma imagers from PHDS
Co and H3D Ine [2].

3.1 Imagers

The GeGI imager from PHDS is a position
sensitive semiconductor detector based on a Peltier-
cooled high purity germanium disc with a diameter
of 90 mm and a thickness of 11 mm. The double-
sided strip sensor has 16 strips in orthogonal
configuration, each with a pitch of 5 mm. It comes
with an energy resolution of < 0.3% (FWHM) at
662 keV and a position resolution of 1.5 mm. The
device operates in Compton imaging mode to
localize identified radionuclides. Identification is
based on recorded spectra using built-in
radionuclide libraries. Identification difficulties arise
from sum peaks. Visualisation of unassigned
emissions is possible based on energy interval
analysis.

The H420 imager from H3D is also a
position-sensitive semiconductor detector but based
on 4 CZT crystals each with a size of
22x22x10 mm’. Each crystal has 11X11 anode pixels
with 1 cathode pad. The detector comes with an
energy resolution of < 1.1% (FWHM) at 662 keV
and a position resolution of 0.5mm. This device
also operates in Compton imaging mode similar to
the GeGI device. In addition with its coded aperture
it offers localisation detection using lower energy
photon emissions.

3.2, Measurements

We first performed measurements of nuclear
waste drums in a shielded chamber at Svafo. One of
the waste drums as shown as example in Figure 6
has a size of 280 1. Inside the drum are insert drums
of 200 1 and 100 1 size arranged such to create gaps
in between. The gap of about 5 cm between the
inner drum and the 2001 drum is filled with
concrete and the gap to the outer drum with air. The
inner drum itself contained contaminated and active
nuclear waste.

The detectors were positioned directly in front
of the drum in a central position with a distance of
80+10 cm as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 6: Measurement of waste drum at Svafo.

Both detectors come with digital cameras that
allow to visualize the measured radiation overlayed
on a photograph of the environment. In addition, a
HPGe spectrometer was used to cross check the
results of found radionuclides of the two gamma
imagers. Drums were studied from up to 4 different
angles, rotating the drums 90° each step.

3.3 Results

The two imagers performed relatively well in
identifying and positioning radionuclides in the
waste drums. Examples of identified radionuclides
in drum 5 are shown in Table 1. Both imagers are
capable of Compton imaging (Com) to localize the
position of origin of radionuclides present. The
H420 in addition has a coded aperture (CA) for
localising radionuclides having lower energetic
photon emissions. In Figure7 the augmented
visualisations of the GeGI and H420 imager are
shown for the radionuclides Eu-152 and Cs-137 as
example.

In general the results of both imagers were
fairly comparable with a few exceptions. One
exception was the detection of Co-60 where the two
imagers had a discrepancy in positioning the source
within the waste drum. We believe that it had to do
with differences in detection capabilities of sources

at low activity for the two imagers. In fact, the GeGI
device was performing much better than the H420 in
this respect. This is most likely due to the larger
active area of the crystal (64 cm? vs. 19 cm”) and the
better energy resolution (0.3% vs. 1.1% at 662 keV).

4 CONCLUSIONS

We were able to show that position sensitive
detectors can be used for tomographic scans of fuel
rods and agreement with simulations is good.
However, quantifying the improvement that justifies
the replacement of the present PGET system is still
to be performed. The rate capabilities of large CZT
detectors as well as Compton imaging have to be
further studied in this context.

Concerning the usage of commercial
Compton imagers, we can conclude that such
devices perform well within limitations. Low
activity radionuclides are challenging and there are
limitations due to the closed commercial software.
