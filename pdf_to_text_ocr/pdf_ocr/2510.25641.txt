Mesoscopic systems possess shot noise in their currents due to the quantization of the conducting
quasiparticles. Measurements of this shot noise are useful to study phenomena that do not man-
ifest themselves in standard conductance or resistance measurements, such as the statistics of the
conducting quasiparticles or quantum entanglement via Bell tests [I] [2]. The corresponding particle
statistics can be determined via two particle quantum interference experiments, such as the Hong-
Ou-Mandel effect which demonstrates a bunching effect for bosons [3] or an anti-bunching effect
in fermions [4] [5]. In superconducting proximity junctions, electrons incident on a superconduc-
tor can induce holes via crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) [6] in spatially separated normal metal
leads, where the resulting hole currents have nontrivial partition noise due to the four terminal
configuration. These nonlocally generated currents, using a superconductor as a mesoscopic beam
splitter, enable fabrication of mesoscopic analogs to quantum optics interferometers using metallic
and superconducting films with multiport geometries.

Interference is an ubiquitous phenomenon in both clas-
sical and quantum physics. In the quantum regime, cer-
tain effects are predicted that have no classical analog.
Well-known examples include single-photon interference,
or the Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect [7 [8], and two-
photon interference, or the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect. [3],
which demonstrates the bunching of photons that cannot
be explained classically. Although both single-electron
interference [911], and two-electron interference [4}
has been demonstrated, such experiments are not easy,
primarily due to the difficulty of realizing the equivalent
of a beam splitter for electrons. Here we show that a
superconductor of dimensions comparable to the super-
conducting coherence length € can act as a beam splitter
for quasiparticles in normal metal wires connected to it
through the process of crossed Andreev reflection (CAR)
[6], which coherently couples electrons in spatially sep-
arated normal metals through their mutual interaction
with the superconductor. This would enable observa-
tion of single-electron and two-electron interference in
superconducting/normal-metal hybrid devices.

It is instructive to first review the Hong-Ou-Mandel

ference effect.

effect for photons [12]. Consider then a simple optical
beam splitter shown in Fig. [i] Photons incident from
paths 1 and 2 on this beam splitter are each partially
transmitted and partially reflected. The incoming pho-
ton along path 1 is transmitted to 3 with a coefficient
t and reflected into 4 with coefficient r. Similarly, the
incoming photon in 2 is transmitted to 4 with coefficient
t and reflected into 3 with coefficient r. The coefficients
t and r are in general complex quantities. This can be
represented in a scattering matrix 4:

(=) G@) 7
If we denote the initial state of the system by |i) =
alas |0) = |1100) where |0) = |0000) is the product of
the empty state for each channel, and the final state as
f), then the state after the photons traverse the beam
splitter can be represented in terms of the outgoing states

of al and G4.

10) > wal +rah)(rah + tal) 0) =|f) (2)

Requiring this transformation to be unitary due to num-
ber conservation of photons, we obtain the conditions
lt? + |r? = 1 and r*t+t*r = 0. Setting t > te’ and
r — re’®, the second condition gives cos(@ — ¢) = 0,
whose simplest solution is 6 — ¢ = 7/2. Arbitrarily set-
ting @ = 0, and considering the specific case of a 50:50
beam splitter, we finally obtain t = 1/2, r = i/V2.
Putting these values into our expression for the state
after the photons pass through the beam splitter, we ob-
tain

so that after transmission through the beam splitter,
here is equal probability of either both photons being
along path 3 or both photons being along path 4, but
zero probability that one photon would be found in path
3 while the other is found in path 4. This is the bo-
son (photon) bunching effect discovered experimentally
y Hong, Ou, and Mandel [8], which requires that the
incoming photons be identical (i.e., they have the same
olarization).
The analysis for a 50:50 beam splitter for electrons
is similar, except that we have anticommuting fermionic
creation (¢t) and annihilation (@) operators instead of the
commuting bosonic ones. The equivalent expression for
ermionic two particle interference is then

5 (ich +21) (6 + te}) |0)

= |0011)

so that the only possibility is that one electron is found
along path 3 while the other is found along path 4, since
both electrons cannot be found along the same path due
to the Pauli exclusion principle. This is the fermionic
anti-bunching effect demonstrated with continuous elec-
tron sources [4] and single electron sources [5]. Of course,
as with the photon case, this only applies if the electrons
are identical, which in our case implies that they have
the same spin orientation.

There is a growing interest in electronic quantum op-
tics due to the scalability inherent to solid state systems
(a nice discussion of electronic quantum optics is pre-
sented in [I5}). While beam splitters are a standard
component in a quantum optics toolkit, electronic beam
splitters are more difficult to realize. Most implementa-
tions to date use quantum point contacts (QPCs) in high
mobility two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) where
he transmittance and reflectance of the beam splitter
can be tuned by a gate voltage [10]. Others have used
chiral edge states from quantum Hall devices in addi-
ion to QPCs to minimize backscattering [4] [9]. This has
een further refined by having electrons emitted from
a quantum dot, which provides a source of single elec-
rons, which then interfere while in the edge states of a
2DEG at a QPC {5} [11]. QPC beam splitters have also
een used in broader applications, such as realizing an
electronic equivalent to the Mach-Zehnder interferometer
and, recently, interfering anyonic quasiparticles with
fractional statistics [[7}20]. However, QPCs are more
difficult to use with more terminals, and quantum Hall
systems require large magnetic fields and high electron
mobility. Here, we propose using a superconductor as an
electronic beam splitter. This will allow us to circumvent
the need for large magnetic fields, allow for an arbitrary
amount of leads, and significantly simplify device fabri-
cation.

Beam splitters based on superconductor/normal-metal
hybrid structures have been discussed 21] and experi-

mentally realized [22] [23], but such devices had at most
2 normal metals in contact with the superconductor or
separated by quantum dots. Here we consider a beam
splitter based on a superconductor/normal-metal hybrid
device with multiple, spatially separated normal metals.
For simplicity, and to make a connection with the op-
tical beam splitter, will will consider the four terminal
configuration as shown in Fig with a current applied
to lead 1 and drained out the superconductor. An elec-
tron with a specific spin orientation incident on a normal-
metal/superconductor (NS) interface in one of the nor-
mal metal leads can undergo a number of scattering pro-
cesses at the NS interface: it can be normally reflected,
it can be Andreev reflected as a hole in the same lead, it
can be Andreev reflected as a hole into one of the other
leads (the process of CAR), or it can elastically co-tunnel
into one of the other leads. We shall not discuss normal
reflection here as it does not contribute to the cross cor-
relations signals of interest. We shall also not consider
elastic co-tunneling (EC), as recent theory suggests when
the inverse proximity effect is not strong, EC is much
weaker than CAR [24]. Some experimental findings in-
dicate that EC might even be entirely absent [25]. We
will consider devices in this limit. The resulting CAR
currents in spatially separated normal leads from lead 1
are nonlocal; they are not in the direction of conventional
current flow.

To simplify our discussion, we consider the case of zero
temperature where the ground state in the normal leads
is the vacuum state of the filled Fermi sea. A spin-up
electron incident on the NS interface in lead 1 is then
Andreev reflected as a spin-down hole into all the leads
attached to the superconductor. This process can be rep-
resented by

N=4
a, = So Tata (3)

a=1

Note that the analysis lends itself to an arbitrary amount
of leads, but we will only consider the four terminal case.
A similar scattering matrix as the photonic Hong-Ou-
Mandel effect can be constructed as:

ar Ti Ti2 Ti3 Tia Cy
Co | _ | Tar The Th3 Tra C2) (
a. T3, T3. T33 T3a Cay

where the diagonal elements Tq are the coefficients for
local Andreev reflection, and the off-diagonal elements
are the coefficients for CAR. The constraints on the scat-
tering matrix T due to unitarity are

on

Se Tel, = Y2 Th Toe = a0 (
b=1 b=1

For example, the sum of the probabilities into all possible
leads from lead 1 must be unity.

ITi|? + |Tral? + \Disl? + (Pal? =1 (6)

Similarly, the sum of the probabilities into all possible
leads from lead 2 must be unity.

|To1|? + |Too|? + |To3|? + |Toa|? = 1 (7)

n general, the scattering matrix coefficients are complex
quantities that depend on the transparency of the NS
interfaces as well as the distance in the superconductor
etween NS interfaces. We expect the diagonal terms
Taa|?, which represent conventional Andreev reflection,
o be larger than the off-diagonal CAR, contributions.

If we consider an electron incident only in lead 1,
his configuration is then similar to that used to ex-
lore the Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect in the ex-
eriments on 2DEGs discussed earlier. It is easy to con-
firm that the expectation value of holes in leads 3 and
4 after Andreev reflection is (f eset |f) = |Tis|? and

3

(f| éay eh |f) = |Tia|? respectively and that the cross cor-
relation (f| Gaye Gaye |f) vanishes.

As with the experiments on 2DEGs, however, imple-
menting an experiment where only one electron impinges
on the NS interface is difficult, as there are many quan-
tized conductance channels present in mesoscopic leads
[I], and experiments are usually performed by applying
a voltage or sourcing a current. In this case, the experi-
mentally relevant measurement is the correlations in the
noise in the current or voltage between different normal
leads which can be encapsulated by the quantity

where the angular brackets denote expectation values in
the state |) after Andreev reflection. Using our previous
results, we immediately obtain g33 = |Ti3|~? — 1, gaa =
|Ty4|-? — 1, and gg4 = —1. |Ti3|? and |Ty4|? are both less
than unity, so that the autocorrelations g33 and g44 are
both positive while the cross correlation measure g34 is
perfectly anti-correlated.

Let us now consider the case of two-electron interfer-
ence, one from lead 1 and one from lead 2. The initial
state is then

li) = et ,é4, |0) = [1100) (9)

After transforming our initial electron creation operators
to hole creation operators when incident on the beam
splitter, the average number of holes in lead 3 is:

(@ay@h)) = [Tis P? + |2os|? (10)
Similarly, the average number of holes in lead 4 is:
(@ay€iy) = [Tral? + [Paal? (11)

If we next calculate the likelihood of a hole in both lead
3 and lead 4, we obtain:

(@ayehy Gaye) = [Tral?[Dasl? + [Toa P (Tis? — Caz Tis Tes + Tha Te1Ti3 Tes) (12)

Our autocorrelation coefficients are
-1
933 = ( Ty3|? + [Tos *) = (13)
and
2 2\ 1
gaa = (ITs + |Toa ) - (14)
and the cross correlation coefficient is:
T1374 — Tos Th, |?
gS ITisT hs 23 2 (15)
(tsi? + |To3 2) ( Tya|? + |Toa a)

Since g34 is a negative quantity in all realistic cases, there
is a distinct, but not perfect, anti-correlative feature in
measurement. This agrees with expectations. If one elec-
tron is incident from lead 1 and one from lead 2, there will
be holes ejected with some weighted probabilities into
any pair of leads. This is distinct from the strict anti-
correlation found in the conventional electronic cases.

In summary, beam splitters across sub-disciplines in
physics are useful tools to investigate and utilize the
quantum properties of incoming streams of particles
{13]. The effects of particle statistics, either bosonic [3],
fermionic [4] [5], or anyonic [17], are highlighted in two-
article interference tests. Their mesoscopic equivalents,
along with associated shot noise measurements, provide
information in non-equilibrium systems not readily ac-
cessible by resistance or conductance measurements. Our
roposed device possesses key advantages and points of
interest over other electronic beam splitters. There is no
need for a large magnetic field. The device fabrication is
also simpler, as metallic films can be used compared to
high-mobility GaAs crystalline films, and more elaborate
devices with an arbitrary amount of ports can be con-
structed. The nonlocal CAR signals will be small, but
he negative cross correlation coefficent provides a clear

of the Andreev beam splitter can be used as a lumped
element for further construction of mesoscopic interfero-

ious solid-state interferometers for tests of entanglement

and quantum information [2] 2d 27].
