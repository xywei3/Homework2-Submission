Strain engineering is a powerful strategy for controlling the structural and electronic properties of
two-dimensional materials, particularly in systems hosting charge density wave (CDW) order. In
this work, we apply uniaxial tensile and compressive strain to thin 1T-TaS> flakes using a flexible,
device-compatible platform, and systematically investigate the strain-dependent behavior of the
nearly commensurate (NC) to incommensurate (IC) CDW phase transition. This transition is
driven by Joule heating at room temperature. Electrical transport measurements reveal that both
the switching threshold voltage and the resistance of the NC-CDW phase exhibit clear, reversible
strain dependence. Furthermore, we identify a quadratic dependence between the strain-induced
resistance change and the threshold voltage, confirming that piezoresistive modulation governs
the strain-tunability of the phase transition. We demonstrate a room-temperature, electrically-
readout strain and displacement sensor with threshold-like response in a programmable window.

These results highlight the potential of 1T-TaS2 for on-chip sensing of strain and displacement.
Charge density waves (CDW) are periodic modulations of the electronic charge density,
coupled to lattice distortions! CDWs generally emerge due to electron-electron
interactions (via Fermi surface nesting)'* and electron-phonon interactions (with an
associated CDW phonon mode)**. Materials hosting CDW order are of great interest due
to their rich phase diagrams, where the charge order is intimately linked to correlated,
low-temperature phases like superconductivity>* and Mott physics’°. Two-dimensional
(2D) materials hosting CDWs are particularly appealing, as charge order can persist above
room temperature!” (RT) and the reduced dimensionality boosts their susceptibility to

external perturbations!!.

Strain engineering in 2D materials provides a versatile platform to modulate materia
properties: from bandgap engineering leading to changes of electronic and optical
properties'; to tipping the balance between ground states in correlated 2D materials!*"°.
Within correlated materials, strain constitutes a natural tuning knob for CDW materials,

as the charge order itself is coupled to a lattice distortion and thus highly sensitive to

mechanical deformation. Strain engineering of CDW materials has been shown to alter

the ground state’"’, enhance or suppress charge order or modify the dynamics of
metastable states***>. However, most studies rely on bulky hardware incompatible with
integrated devices*°**. Wrinkling via patterned substrates offers an on-chip alternative,

yet it imposes only fixed, non-tunable strain*°?!

, similar to unintentional strain resulting
from growth processes*’. These limitations highlight the opportunity to harness large,

well-defined strain in device-compatible geometries to manipulate CDW order in situ and

unlock novel electronic functionalities.

1T-TaSz, a layered transition metal dichalcogenide, is an attractive platform for tailoring
CDW order because it hosts a hierarchy of CDW phases: from incommensurate (IC) order

at high temperatures, to nearly commensurate (NC), to fully commensurate (C) order at
low temperatures. Extensive work demonstrates that the individual CDW phases, and the

transitions linking them, can be actively manipulated through a multitude of external

perturbations, such as electrostatic gating’’~", electromagnetic fields’, targeted
chemical doping**“° and others*’**. Of particular relevance for applications, the NC-to-
IC phase transition occurs around Tc = 350 K, opening the door to practical devices that

exploit CDW phase transitions near RT*93640414950,

Previous studies of strain in 1T-TaS2, many of which focused on hydrostatic pressure”*>!,

revealed dramatic effects such as a collapse of the Mott gap
CDW phases*!*, or the emergence of superconductivity***!. A handful of experiments
have also explored in-plane deformations, but they rely on complex and resource-

intensive setups
Crucially, most reports target the low-temperature phases, leaving the NC and IC orders

near 350 K largely unexamined under strain. Dynamical strain-tuning of this phase

transition could enable room-temperature, device-compatible CDW functionalities.

In this work, we employ a simple yet versatile method to apply uniaxial strain
continuously and reversibly, enabling dynamic control of the NC-to-IC CDW transition
in 1T-TaS2. This approach not only provides a practical route for exploring strain-
dependent behavior but also lays the foundation for the development of strain-sensitive
devices. To illustrate this potential, we demonstrate two room-temperature electrical
detection of both tensile and compressive strain in two distinct operation modes.
Remarkably, one can leverage the CDW phase transition as an intrinsic amplification

mechanism to obtain exceptionally large strain sensitivity.

In the nearly commensurate (NC) phase, Star-of-David supercells (see inset) form hexagonal domains.
Above Tc, the CDW becomes incommensurate (IC). d) Current-voltage (IV) characteristic of Device 1
under zero applied strain. The NC-to-IC phase transition, driven by Joule heating, occurs at the threshold
voltage Vin, appearing as an abrupt current increase in curve I, with hysteresis observed upon reducing the
bias in II (similarly for positive voltages in III and IV). e) Strain-tuning of the NC-to-IC transition in
Device 2. Tensile strain increases Vin, while compressive strain decreases Vin. For visual clarity, only the
forward sweeps are shown.

Figure 1a illustrates the experimental concept, where uniaxial strain is applied to a 1T-
TaS2 device fabricated on a flexible polycarbonate substrate using a four-point bending
setup>>. A mechanically exfoliated, thin flake is positioned onto pre-patterned source and
drain electrodes, forming the conductive channel (Fig 1b). The four-point bending

configuration allows for controlled application of tensile (€7) and compressive (€¢) strain

directly during electrical measurements.

At room temperature (T < Tc), the 1T-TaS2 exhibits a nearly commensurate charge
density wave (NC-CDW), characterized by hexagonal domains of CDW supercells
arising from a ¥13 x ¥13 Star-of-David distortion of the Ta atoms (Fig. Ic). In the NC-

CDW state, electronic conduction largely takes place along incommensurate regions
between the commensurate CDW domains. As the temperature increases above Tc ~ 350
K, the CDW order becomes incommensurate with the underlying lattice, and the material
enters a metallic incommensurate CDW (IC-CDW) phase. The proximity of this phase
transition to RT makes 1T-TaS:2 an ideal platform for controlling CDW order under

ambient conditions.

Interestingly, this NC-to-IC phase transition can be driven by Joule heating, as shown in
Figure ld. The current-voltage (IV) characteristics of the flake exhibit a sharp, abrupt
increase in current around +0.85 V during the forward voltage sweeps (I and III). This
current jump signals the transition to the IC-CDW phase, as the dissipated Joule power
raises the flake temperature above Tc. When the voltage is swept back down (II and IV),
the system returns to the NC-CDW phase at around +0.72 V. The hysteresis observed
between forward and backward sweeps reflects the thermal nature of the transition. This
behavior is consistent with previous reports on devices fabricated on rigid

substrates?°76°096>7,

All measurements presented here are performed at ambient
conditions, with the only source of heating being self-heating, i.e. the electrical power

dissipation within the device.

We now explore how uniaxial strain modifies this heating-induced phase transition. To
do so, we perform IV measurements while systematically applying either tensile or
compressive strain to the substrate with a four-point bending setup (see Methods). Figure
le shows representative IV curves of the same device (Device 2) for three different strain
conditions: zero strain, tensile strain (€7 = 0.3%), and compressive strain (€¢ = 0.3%).
While compressive strain €¢ is usually defined as negative, in this work we will refer to

the absolute value of each type of strain, i.e. we define both €7 and €¢ as positive.
In the three cases, an abrupt jump in the current, marking the NC-to-IC phase transition,
is clearly visible. Notably, the threshold voltage at which the phase transition occurs,
denoted Vin, is shifted by the applied strain. In the absence of strain Vin 1.01 V, while
tensile strain increases Vin, delaying the onset of the phase transition. Conversely,

compressive strain reduces Vin, promoting an earlier transition.

To further investigate this tunability, we systematically study how Vin evolves as a
function of applied strain. Figure 2 shows IV characteristics obtained while progressively
increasing the applied tensile and compressive strain. We show here two separate devices
for tensile (Device 3) and compressive strain (Device 4). For tensile strain (Figs. 2a—b),
we observe a clear, monotonic increase in V, as the flake is stretched. A linear fit to the
data up to 0.6% strain yields a gauge factor (for the threshold voltage) of AVin/Ae = 55
mV/%. This behavior is reversible and stable over multiple strain cycles (Fig. 2c) that
comprise several hours of measurement time, highlighting the robustness of the

phenomenon (see Figure $8 for longer cyclic measurements).

Applying compressive strain produces the opposite effect (Fig. 2d), with Vin decreasing
monotonically as the flake is compressed. The magnitude of the strain sensitivity (Fig.
2e) under compression is similar to the tensile case, with a threshold-voltage gauge factor
of AVi1/Ae = 57 mV/%. Within the definition used here, this figure of merit remains
positive, indicating that Vin decreases as the magnitude of compressive strain increases.
As for tensile strain, the device shows good reproducibility over multiple strain cycles
(Fig. 2f). We note that in Figs. 2e-f, we depict the absolute values of Vin extracted from
the negative branch of the IV characteristic (I < 0), while panel (d) depicts the positive

branch.

These results demonstrate that uniaxial strain provides a robust and continuous method
to control the NC-to-IC CDW phase transition at RT. We observe this trend consistently
across all fabricated devices (additional data in Supp. Info.), where the crystallographic
axes of the flakes are randomly aligned with respect to the strain direction. This indicates

an in-plane isotropy of the strain modulation of 1T-TaSz, as previously reported”’.

In addition, we explored the effect of biaxial tensile strain on the NC-to-IC phase
transition. We fabricated samples in rigid (Si/SiOz) and flexible (PC) substrates and
compared the IV characteristics as the sample temperature is increased above RT (see
Supp. Info.). The thermal expansion of the PC substrate (larger than that of Si/SiO2) exerts
biaxial tensile strain on the device*®. The observed trend in Vm agrees with that of uniaxial

tensile strain, i.e. Vin shifts to larger values as the sample is (biaxially) strained.
Beyond shifting the threshold voltage, uniaxial strain also modifies the flake resistance.
We examine the piezoresistance of the NC-CDW phase as it could be linked to the strain
tunability of the NC-IC transition. Figures 3a and 3b show the strain-dependent resistance
of the NC phase under tensile and compressive strain, respectively: tensile strain increases
the resistance approximately linearly, while compression reduces it, yielding a positive

gauge factor.

This response likely originates from a geometric effect that typically dominates
piezoresistivity in metals. In the NC phase of 1T-TaSz, transport proceeds along a
percolative network between commensurate domains‘. Stretching the flake increases the
effective path length and reduces its width (via the Poisson effect), producing the
observed positive gauge factor. Other contributions, such as strain-induced changes to the
density of states or phonon spectrum, are not expected to significantly affect room-
temperature resistance. The piezoresistance of the IC-CDW phase (see Supp. Info.) is

consistent in sign and magnitude with the NC-CDW response.

Figure 3. a) Resistance of Device 3 in the NC-CDW state under increasing tensile strain. The resistance
rises linearly, resulting in a positive gauge factor GF. b) Resistance of Device 4 under increasing
compressive strain. The resistance decreases, but the gauge factor remains positive, as compressive strain
is defined as negative. c) Quadratic relation between resistance and threshold voltage for Device 5 under
uniaxial tensile strain (R « VJ,), confirming that strain-dependent Joule heating governs the NC-to-IC

phase transition.
We quantify the strain sensitivity of the resistance using the piezoresistive gauge factor,
defined as GF = AR/(Roé), where AR is the strain-induced change in resistance, Ro is the
resistance under zero strain, and ¢ is the strain magnitude. We find GF = 9.7 for tensile
strain and GF = 2.8 for compression, in line with typical geometric gauge factors of GF
~ 1-10 for metallic systems’. Such piezoresistive effect enables 1T-TaS2 devices to
function as bipolar piezoresistive strain gauges, which can detect both tensile and
compressive strain continuously. Notably, the devices exhibit the same sign and
comparable magnitude of piezoresistance both below and above the NC-to-IC phase
transition, enabling operation in either phase. Furthermore, measurements on additional
devices reveal larger values for the piezoresistive gauge factor, in the order of GF ~ 100
(see Supp. Info.). Compared to other single-flake 2D piezoresistive strain gauges”, our
devices deliver comparable gauge factors, operate at large strain levels and feature far

simpler device architectures.

The observed strain dependence of both resistance and Vi, suggests an intuitive origin for
the strain-tunability of the phase transition. The Joule power dissipated in the device,
given by P, = V?/R, depends directly on the flake resistance. Thus, as the applied tensile
strain increases R, a higher voltage is required to reach the critical power needed to drive
the transition to the IC-CDW state. Conversely, compressive strain lowers the resistance,
reducing the required threshold voltage. Previous studies have established that the NC—
IC transition is primarily driven by Joule heating in the channel*~°, supporting our

hypothesis on the origin for this strain-tunable phase transition.

Assuming that the critical Joule power (i.e. the critical temperature Tc) remains constant
with strain, this relationship implies R(e) « V%,(e). To test this hypothesis, we acquire

high-resolution IV data under incremental strain steps of 0.006% up to 0.6% (see Supp.
Info.) in an additional sample (Device 5). For each strain condition, we extract the
corresponding Vi, and the resistance of the flake in the NC-CDW phase. Plotting these
values (Fig. 3c) reveals a clear quadratic relationship between R() and V,,(), confirming
that the strain-tunability of the phase transition originates from the piezoresistive

modulation of the device resistance.

Figure 4. a) Operating principle of the CDW-enhanced compressive strain detector. The flake starts in the
NC state, biased at a detection voltage Vaer near the phase transition (within the range indicated by the
dashed vertical lines). Compressive strain reduces Vin, triggering a sharp current increase as the flake

the return to the NC state. e) Abrupt switching of the device upon incremental application of tensile strain,

for different values of Vaet. f) Programmable detection window for tensile strain detection.
Finally, we leverage the strain-tunable phase transition between CDW phases to
demonstrate an alternative mechanism for detection of uniaxial strain at room
temperature. We construct threshold-like strain detectors that exploit the destruction
(nucleation) of charge order to sense compressive (tensile) uniaxial strain. Exploiting the
bi-stability of the IV characteristics as an amplification mechanism, similar to snap-
through sensors™, these detectors exhibit exceptional sensitivity and an electrically-

tunable detection window.

The detection principle for compressive strain is illustrated in Figure 4a. The device is
first initialized in the NC-CDW state under a constant detection bias Vaet, selected close
to the strain-dependent threshold voltage Vin. As discussed earlier, compressive strain
lowers Vin, eventually bringing it below the fixed detection bias. When this condition is
met, the dissipated power exceeds the critical value required to drive the NC-to-IC phase
transition, resulting in a sharp, measurable increase in current. This threshold-like
response is shown in Figure 4b: as compressive strain is gradually increased at constant
Vaet, the device undergoes an abrupt switching event when Vaet = Vin, producing a clear
electrical signal. Notably, the strain level at which this transition occurs can be
continuously tuned by adjusting Vaer, defining a programmable detection window for

compressive strain (dashed lines in Fig. 4a), which in this case extends from 0 to 0.3%.

We quantify the tunability of the detector by plotting the detectable strain as a function
of the detection voltage Vae (Fig. 4c). A linear fit yields a tunability of Ag¢/AVae =
0.0128%/mV, allowing precise control over the strain detection threshold. The current
jump associated with the phase transition is sizable (AI ~ 0.75 mA) and remains largely
independent of the specific threshold conditions. Furthermore, the switching occurs

abruptly within strain increments of Agc = 0.0025%, resulting in an exceptionally high
strain sensitivity of Al/Ae¢ ~ 300 mA/%, enabled by the device’s intrinsic threshold

response.

Detection of tensile strain is also tunable via the choice of the detection bias, as
demonstrated in Figures 4e-f. Applying the same definition as before, we extract a
detector tunability of Ae7/AVae = 0.0264%/mV, while the corresponding strain
sensitivity is Al/Aep ~ 112 mA/%. We note that the IC-to-NC phase transition, which
underpins tensile strain detection, is typically less abrupt than the NC-to-IC transition.
The reverse transition (IC-to-NC) is governed by slow cooling and thermally-activated
nucleation and domain growth”, resulting in a broader, less sharp switching response.
Consequently, the device exhibits reduced sensitivity for tensile strain detection

compared to the compressive strain configuration.

As a threshold strain sensor, our CDW-based device achieves a remarkable sensitivity of
300 mA/%, far exceeding other two-dimensional platforms. The NC-IC transition
produces a sharp change in current, yielding clearly distinguishable signals. Moreover,
the strain-detection window can be continuously tuned by adjusting the applied detection
voltage, allowing real-time control over the strain range. All in all, our CDW-enhanced
strain detector combines high sensitivity with straightforward integration into on-chip
device architectures. The main trade-off is that after each detection event, the device
remains in the switched state (IC state for compressive strain detection, NC for tensile
strain detection). Therefore, the device must be reset before it can detect a new event.
Negative feedback circuits”, which automatically apply a reset signal after each detection

event, would be required to support fast, free-running detection of strain fields.

Interpreting uniaxial strain as a change in source—drain separation (L ~ 25 tm), the device

functions as a high-resolution displacement sensor. Under compressive loading, it
exhibits a current-displacement sensitivity of AI/AL ~ 12 wA/pm (and 4.4 nA/pm under
tension), while the displacement-detection voltage slope is AL/AVdet ~ 660 pm/mV (and
320 pm/mV in tension). These parameters enable reliable detection of sub-nanometer
motions (down to AL = 0.625 nm) within a voltage-controlled sensing window.
Compared to leading resistive and piezoresistive displacement sensors, which achieve

sensitivities around 1 V/um®”

, our CDW detector offers superior sensitivity (600 V/um
assuming a 50 Q load), albeit over a limited +15 nm range. Nonetheless, its compact, on-

chip footprint and dual operation modes for strain and displacement sensing make it a

versatile platform for precision measurements in integrated 2D-material systems.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated reversible, room-temperature control of the NC-to-
IC charge density wave phase transition in thin 1T-TaSz flakes through the application of
uniaxial strain. By systematically tuning the strain and monitoring both the transition
threshold and device resistance, we experimentally confirm that the strain-dependence of
the phase transition originates from the piezoresistive modulation of the flake's resistance,
which directly affects the Joule-heating conditions required to drive the transition. This
mechanism enables precise and systematic tuning of the NC-to-IC phase transition via

tensile and compressive strain, with tunabilities of 55 mV/% and 57 mV/%, respectively.

Leveraging the sharp, threshold-like electrical response at the phase transition, we realize
a compact, highly sensitive strain and displacement detector (~ 0.1-0.3 A/% and ~10
pA/pm) with an electrically-programmable detection window. Notably, one can sense
sub-nanometer displacements at room-temperature in an on-chip architecture. Compared
to conventional approaches, this platform offers a unique combination of sensitivity,
tunability, and device simplicity, made possible by the intrinsic properties of CDW order
in 1T-TaS2. Beyond strain sensing, these results establish strain-tunable CDW devices as

promising candidates for threshold-driven functionalities in emerging technologies such
71,72 and phase-switch electronics’”4. Towards practical

as neuromorphic computing
devices, we note that polymer encapsulation’> presents a promising avenue to improve

further the strain transmission and device stability over time.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Device Fabrication

The 1T-TaS2 crystals were purchased from HQ Graphene (HQ Graphene, The
Netherlands). and exfoliated using commercial scotch tape. To achieve thin crystallites
suitable for device fabrication, the cleaved crystals were transferred to a
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) carrier substrate (Gel-Film WF x4 6.0mil, GelPak) by
gently pressing the exfoliation tape against the PDMS surface and peeling it away slowly.

This process ensures that a variety of flake thicknesses are available for further selection.

The identification of suitable flakes was carried out using transmission-mode optical
microscopy, where semi-transparent flakes were chosen, with thicknesses around ~ 30
nm. The NC-to-IC phase transition in 1T-TaS2 is known to be largely thickness
independent**”!. We observe that thicker samples tend to show smaller voltage jumps at
the phase transition. As the flake thickness increases, interlayer coupling becomes more
important, and we hypothesize that the NC-IC switching dynamics becomes less abrupt

as additional conduction channels (including out-of-plane channels) become available.

The selected flakes were then transferred from the PDMS carrier substrate to the final
device substrate using an all-dry deterministic transfer method’®”’. The transfer process
was conducted under an optical zoom lens system to ensure proper alignment of the flake
over the electrodes. The final substrate consists of a 250 wm thick polycarbonate sheet
(Modulor, Article No.0262951) with pre-patterned source and drain electrodes. The

polycarbonate substrate, chosen for its flexibility, allowed for the application of
controlled strain via mechanical bending. The electrodes were fabricated by evaporating
a 45 nm layer of gold onto the polycarbonate substrate, using a 5 nm titanium layer as an
adhesion promoter. Both layers were deposited using e-beam evaporation through a
commercially available shadow mask (Ossila, Product Code E291) to define the electrode

pattern.
Strain Application and Electrical Measurements

In a four-point bending geometry, uniaxial strain is induced in the sample by applying a
force at the sides of the flexible chip (at the loading pins) while supporting it at the center
(supporting pins). Depending on the sign of the applied uniaxial strain, the loading pins
apply the force downwards (tensile) or upwards (compressive). The configuration for
tensile uniaxial strain is pictured in Figure 1a, while the configuration for compressive
strain is shown as an inset in Figure 2d. This configuration creates a bending moment,
resulting in a curvature of the sample. For equidistant pins, the strain (€) on the surface of

the sample can be expressed as:
€= 27+ A/S@,

where t is the thickness of the sample, A is the vertical deflection at the midpoint and d is

the distance between any two consecutive pins.

Uniaxial strain was applied using a motorized bending setup capable of very precise
displacements of the pivotal points of the bending apparatus. The strain levels ranged
from 0.0% to 1%, and were previously calibrated by following the protocol described in
previous work*’®, In the four-point bending used to apply uniaxial tension and
compression; reversing the strain sign requires remounting the sample from the tensile to
the compressive configuration. During this process, inadvertent strain can induce flake

slippage or fracture (see Supp. Info.). To avoid this artifact, we focus on separate devices
for tensile and compressive measurements, in order to study their pristine properties. We
note that, among other methods to apply strain to transport devices, four-point bending
represents a simple, yet powerful method that enables us to dynamically apply strain in a
repeatable manner (see Figure $8). In Table | of the Supp. Info., we provide a brief
comparison with other established strain methods that are compatible with electrical

transport.

Electrical measurements were carried out using a Keithley 2450 source meter unit to
perform current-voltage (IV) sweeps while progressively increasing strain. The CDW
transition was induced via Joule heating, with the threshold voltage corresponding to the

point at which the current exhibited a sudden increase, signaling the phase transition.
Strain-Induced Switching

To investigate strain-induced switching, we fixed the voltage within the transition range,
based on the IV characteristics, and monitored the source-drain current as a function of
strain. This allowed us to observe abrupt current changes associated with strain-induced
modifications to the CDW phase. In the case of tensile strain, as the transition moves to
higher voltages with increasing strain, the flake is pre-biased to the high-temperature IC-
CDW phase and we exploit the hysteretic nature of the phase transition. Thus, we detect

switching from the IC-CDW phase to the NC-CDW upon application of tensile strain.
Biaxial strain measurements

Biaxial strain measurements were performed in an Attodry800 cryostat under fixed
pressure of 10° mbar. IV characteristics were measured using a National Instruments NI
USB-6343 data acquisition board to apply the source-drain voltage and record the current
flowing through the sample, upon amplification by a Femto DLPCA-200 current

amplifier. The IV sweeps were performed at a rate of approximately 21 mV/s for both
samples, measuring one after the other once the target temperature was reached. The
fabrication of samples on rigid Si/SiO2 substrates followed the same procedure detailed

above.
