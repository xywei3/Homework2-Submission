Complex numbers are indispensable in quantum mechanics and the resource theory of
imaginarity has been developed recently. In this paper, we propose a method to construct
imaginary measures by real part states. Specifically, we propose an imaginarity measure
in terms of fidelity and explore its properties. The analytical expression of the imaginarity
measure is presented in qubit systems. The relations between the proposed imaginarity
measure and some other imaginarity measures (such as geometric imaginarity, Tsallis relative
entropy imaginarity and trace norm imaginarity) are derived. The complementarity relations
of the imaginarity measure under a complete set of mutually unbiased bases are provided in
low-dimensional systems. This work not only highlights the prominent role of the real part
state in the imaginarity resource theory, but also reveals the constraint of imaginarity on a

complete set of mutually unbiased bases physically.

I. INTRODUCTION

Complex numbers are indispensable in quantum mechanics. The finding about the ex-
perimental scenario that cannot be exactly modeled using quantum theory with real-valued
amplitudes only [1], attracts much attention on the study of the imaginarity [2-4]. It was
shown that imaginarity has crucial effects on certain discrimination tasks [5], hiding and
masking [6], machine learning [7], pseudorandomness [8], outcome statistics of linear optical
experiments [9], Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distributions [10-13], weak-value theory

[14].
Along with these extensive applications, the imaginarity resource theory has been formu-
lated theoretically [15]. This theory identifies the resource as the presence of nonvanishing
imaginary components in a quantum state’s density matrix, emphasizing the fundamental
role of complex numbers in quantum mechanics. To quantify the imaginarity and deter-
mine the resourcefulness of a given quantum state, different measures of imaginarity have
been proposed, for example, the trace norm imaginarity [15], the relative entropy imagi-
narity [16], the geometric imaginarity [17], the Tsallis relative entropy imaginarity [18] and
the imaginarity measure based on the generalized quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence [19].
Besides to these explicit imaginarity measures, Ref. [20] develops two methods to construct
imaginarity measures, one is by the convex roof construction and the other is by the least
imaginarity of the input pure states under real operations.

In the imaginarity resource theory, for any quantum state p, it can induce the real part
state Re(p) which is derived by eliminating the imaginary part of p, that is, Re(p) = 4(p+p*)
with superscript * denoting the conjugation. A natural question is whether one can measure
the imaginarity of an arbitrary state using its real part state Re(p) straightforwardly. The
answer appears to be affirmative, as further derivation of the original formulas for certain
existing imaginarity measures-such as the trace norm measure [15] and the relative entropy
measure [16]-reveals that quantifying imaginarity by utilizing the real part state is available
and reasonable. Following by this, another question is whether this kind of imaginarity
measures is just valid for such special cases. In this work, we develop a method to construct
imaginarity measures by the real part state Re(p) generally. This indicates the real part
state Re(p) characterizes the imaginarity essentially. By this way, we propose a specific
imaginarity measure and study its properties thoroughly. Further, we find the complemen-
tarity relation of imaginarity under a complete set of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) in
low-dimensional systems. This relation reveals the intrinsic property of imaginarity as the
quantum resource physically.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section II, we give a review
of fundamental concepts regarding to imaginarity measures. In section III, we develop a
method to construct imaginarity measures by real part state Re(p). In particular, we propose
the imaginarity measure Mp. in terms of fidelity and study its properties. We compare
the imaginarity measure Mp. with geometric imaginarity measure, Tsallis relative entropy

imaginarity and trace norm imaginarity in turn. In section IV, we show a complementarity
relation for the imaginarity measure Mp. under a complete set of MUBs in low-dimensional

systems. The conclusion is given in section V.

II. PRELIMINARIES

Let {| ea be an orthonormal basis for d-dimensional Hilbert space H. In imaginarity
resource theory, the quantum state p is real state, if the density matrix of p under the

reference basis is real, that is, p = > pisli) (j|, where each pj = (ilp|j) € R. The set

of real states is denoted as R. Let ® be a quantum operation with Kraus operators kK),
®(-) = 0, Ki(.)K]. © is called a real operation if (m|Kj|n) € R for all 1, m and n. A
nonnegative function M on quantum states is called an imaginarity measure if M satisfies
the following five conditions [15, 21, 22],

M1) Faithfulness: M(p) > 0 and M(p) = 0 if and only if p is real.

M2) Monotonicity: M(®(p)) < M(p) if ® is a real operation.

M3) Probabilistic monotonicity: >, Tr(KipK7)M [ ser] < M(p) if ®(-) =
~~ AK i is a real operation with superscript T’ denoting transpose.

M4) Convexity: M(37,p;2;) < 32, P;)M(q;) for any probability distribution {p;} and

quantum states {p;}.

M5) Additivity for direct sum states: M|pp; © (1 — p)p2| = pM (pi) + (1 — p)M (po),
where p € [0,1], p1, p2 are arbitrary quantum states.

Note that (M2), (M3) and (M4) together imply (M5) [23]. Additionally, (M3) and (M4)

can be derived from (M2) and (M5) [23]. So to construct an imaginarity measure M, one
needs to verify that it satisfies either conditions (M1), (M2) and (M5), or conditions (M1),
(M2), (M3) and (M4).

There are some commonly used imaginarity measures. For example, the trace norm

imaginarity [15] is

. 1 r
Mix() = min||o — ollie = 5 lle — p’ lle (1)

with the trace norm ||A||j; = TrvV A?A and the corresponding optimal real state is Re(p)
[15]. The relative entropy imaginarity [16] is

Mre(p) = min S(p||o) = S(Re(p)) — S(p), (2)
where S(p) = —Tr[plogp] is the von Neumann entropy, and S(p||c) = Tr(plogp) —
Tr(ploga). The corresponding optimal real state in Eq. (2) is also Re(p). The geomet-

ric imaginarity [17] is

Mg(p) = 1 ~ max F%(p,0) = 5(1— F(0.")), (3)

F(p,0) = Try/ pov. (4)

The trace norm imaginarity, relative entropy imaginarity and geometric imaginarity are

with fidelity [24]

all defined in terms of optimization. Fortunately, the optimizations are all solved and the

analytical formulae are provided.

Ill. A NEW METHOD TO CONSTRUCT IMAGINARITY MEASURE

For any quantum states p and o in a d-dimensional system, suppose D defined on any

pair of states (p,c) is a real function satisfying
(1) (Nonnegativity) D(p, Re(p)) > 0 and D(p, Re(p)) = 0 if and only if p = Re(p).

(2) (Contractive under CPTP maps) D(®(p),®(c)) < D(p,c) for arbitrary completely
positive trace-preserving (CPTP) maps ®.

(3) (Additive under direct sum states) D(pipi®p2p2, pic @p202) = prD (pi, 01) +p2D(pe2, 02)
for probability distributions {p;} and density operators {;} and {o;} supporting on the

same subspace.

Here the function D is not necessarily a metric, because we do not demand that the function
D is symmetric about two components or obeys the triangle inequality. Based on such

function D, for any quantum state p, we define
M(p) = D(p, Re(p)). (5)
Theorem 1. M(p) is a well-defined imaginarity measure.

We leave the proof in Appendix A. Theorem 1 provides a new method to construct imag-

inarity measures by the real part states. One advantage of this kind of imaginarity measures
is the absence of optimization, so it may be convenient for calculation. Furthermore, the
real part state Re(p) has less parameters compared with general quantum state.

Here we give a summary about the existing imaginarity measures with respect to
the real part state Re(p) in Table I, where the Tsallis relative entropy is defined as
D,(pl|o) = {pre *)-t with a € (0,1), and the generalized quantum Jensen-Shannon
divergence (GQJSD) is defined as Jo(p,7) = 4 (Da (p|| 42) + Da (o||252)) [19]. We can
see that these imaginarity measures are factually all specific cases of Theorem 1 and the

corresponding functions D are also listed.

Now for any quantum states p and o, if we specify the function D as D(p,a) = 1—F(p,¢),

one can verify that this function meets the three conditions required. Subsequently, we derive

the imaginarity measure
Mre(p) = 1 — F(p, Re(p)). (6)

In Appendix B, we shall prove that the imaginarity measure Mpe(p) satisfies the following

properties.

Theorem 2. Mg.(p) is a well-defined imaginarity measure and satisfies the following prop-

erties.

(1) 0 < Mpre(p) < 1 - wey Mre(p) = 0 if and only if p is real. The upper bound 1 — Ed is

Mre(p) satisfy

In the case of single qubit, it is straightforward to derive the analytical expression of

imaginarity measure Mpe.

Theorem 3. For any qubit state p = $(I+7r-o) with r = (rz,Ty,rz) € R®, |r| =

(= TeP)G= eP +09) +14 InP 37!
Mre(p) = 5 (10)

We leave the proof in Appendix C. From Theorem 3 we see that the imaginarity of p
increases with the coefficient |r,| and the latter is confined by the length of the Bloch vector
|r| (See FIG. 1).

Obviously the geometric imaginarity M, in Eq. (3) and the imaginarity measure Mpe
in Eq. (6) are both defined in form of fidelity. In fact, these two imaginarity measures are

different but closely related.

Theorem 4. For any quantum state p, the geometric imaginarity M,(p) and the imaginarity

measure Mge(p) satisfy
Mre(p) < Mg(p) < 1—[1— Mre(p). (11)

The equality Mpe(p) = Mz(p) holds if and only if p is a real state. And M,(p) reaches the
upper bound 1 — [1 — Mpe(p)]? if and only if the optimal real state of p with respect to the

geometric imaginarity M,(p) is the real part state Re(p).

Eq. (10) in qubit systems. The subfigure (b) is the contour plot of Mpre with r, = 0.

The proof is provided in Appendix D. Similarly, for the Tsallis relative entropy imagi-
narity Mp1 (p) =1—A(p, p*) [18] with A(p,c) = Tr(,/pe) denoting the quantum affinity,
employing the relation A(p,7) < F(p,c) [25] and the formula of the geometric imaginarity
in Eq. (3), we have 2M,(p) < Mry1(p). Hence, we can derive the relation between the

imaginarity measure Mp, and Tsallis relative entropy imaginarity as follows.
Corollary 1. For any quantum state p, the imaginarity measure Mge(p) and the Tsallis
relative entropy imaginarity Mr1(0) satisfy
1
Mre(p) S 5Mr.1(0),
and the equality holds if and only if p is a real state.

Now we define
M,(p) = 1 — max F(p, 0) (12)
by removing the square from the fidelity F in the definition of geometric imaginarity. One
can check that M{(p) satisfies conditions (M1) and (M2). As a quantifier of the imaginarity,
employing the formula in Eq. (3), the analytical expression of Mj(p) is Mj(p) = 1—

M,(p) < Mre(p). (13)

Now we take an example to compare these imaginarity measures illustratively.

Example 1. Let | +i) = —(|0) + i]1)), consider the mixed state

p= ri titi] + (1p) (14)

with 0 < p< 1. It can be easily calculated that the geometric imaginarity and the nor-
malized Tsallis relative entropy imaginarity M71 (p) = $M, 4 (p) of p coincide and equal

the imaginarity measure Mg. and the quantifier of the imaginarity Mj; of p coincide and

Mr, 1(p) = Mg(o) (15)

equal to

The imaginarity measure Mpe(M;) and M,(M), 1 ) increase with the parameter p (See FIG.
2). When p = 0, the quantum state in Eq. (14) becomes maximally mixed state [/2 which
is real state. In this case, the imaginarity measure Mpe(Mj) and M,(M, 1 ) vanish. When
p =1, the quantum state in Eq. (14) becomes maximally imaginary state |+i). In this case,
the imaginarity measure Mge(M,) and M,(M,. 1 ) reach their maximum values. Furthermore,
one can check that the geometric imaginarity M, reaches its upper bound 1 — [1 — Mp.(p)]*

for0O<p<1l.

As we have mentioned earlier, the geometric imaginarity as well as the trace norm imagi-
narity and relative entropy imaginarity are all defined in form of optimization initially. The
optimalizations for the trace norm imaginarity and relative entropy imaginarity are attained
by the real part state Re(p). However the optimal real state for the geometric imaginarity
is still unknown. Next we explore the optimal real state for the geometric imaginarity in

qubit systems.

The analytical formula in Eq. (17) is obtained in [26]. For the proof of the optimal real

where xp = 2 =

state in Eq. (18), we leave it in the Appendix E. Theorem 5 tells us that the optimal real
state in accordance with the geometric imaginarity is generally not the real part state. It
coincides with the real part state if and only ifr, =r, = 0 or r, = 0. That is also the reason
why the state given in Eq. (14) enable geometric imaginarity to reach its upper bound in
Theorem 4.

Additionally, we find that the imaginarity measure Mp. is bounded by the trace norm

imaginarity as follows, where we denote the purity P(p) = Tr(”).

Theorem 6. For any quantum state p, the imaginarity measure Mr. and the trace norm
imaginarity satisfy

We leave the proof in Appendix F. The second inequality in Theorem 6 indicates a relation

among the imaginarity measure Mp., the trace norm imaginarity Mj, and the purity
[1 — Mre(p)]” + Mur(p)” = P(p).

This relation shows for any given quantum state p, the imaginarity measure Mp, increases
with the trace norm imaginarity M,,. However the purity limits the sum of [1—Mre(p)|* and
M,,(p)?. Next, we illustrate the evaluation of the imaginarity measure Mp. with a specific

example, using the trace norm imaginarity M,.

Example 2. Turning again to the mixed state given by Eq. (14) in Example 1. It can
be easily calculated that the trace norm imaginarity is Mi,(p) = p and the purity of p is
P(p) = Ye In consideration of the imaginarity measure Mp.(p) in Eq. (16), we find
the imaginarity measure Mp., trace norm imaginarity M,, and purity P increase with the
parameter p. When p = 0, the quantum state in Eq. (14) becomes maximally mixed state
1/2. In this case, both Mge(p) and Mi,(p) vanish. Meanwhile the purity P() reaches its
minimum value 1/2. When p = 1, the quantum state in Eq. (14) becomes the maximally
imaginary state | +i). In this case, both Mpe(p) and M,,(p) reach their maximum values.
The visualization of the relation in Eq. (19) is presented in FIG. 3, from which we see the
imaginarity measure Mp.(p) coincides with its lower bound. So the lower bound in Eq. (19)

is tight.

IV. THE COMPLEMENTARITY RELATIONS OF THE IMAGINARY MEA-
SURE Mr

In this section we show the complementarity relation of imaginary measure Mp. under
a complete set of MUBs. First in any qubit systems, suppose By), Bo, and Bs are three

orthonormal bases composed by the eigenvectors of three Pauli operators,

By = {|0), |1)},
Bz = {Jq(|0) +i]1)), Je(10) —i]1))},
Bs = {J5(10) +|1)), —y(10) — [1))}-

These three orthonormal bases B,, By and Bs; are mutually unbiased. In Appendix G,

we shall prove the complementarity relation of imaginary measure Mp. under the set of

{Bi} i=1,2,3-

FIG. 3: (Color Online) The visualization of the bounds for Mp. in Theorem 6 for the qubit
state in Eq. (14). The red dashed curve above represents f; = 1 — (P(p) — Me(p)?)?
corresponding to the upper bound in Eq. (19). The yellow dashed curve below represents

1

fo=l- E t+ iV/(d —(d- d—1)M.(o)| > corresponding to the lower bound in Eq.

(19). The blue solid curve represents Mp. and it coincides with the lower bound fy.

Theorem 7. For any qubit state p, the imaginarity measure Mp. under mutually unbiased

bases B,, By and Bs satisfies

P = = 2
(1 MB)? (1 Mp2)? (1 MBs)? > J (1 = Irl2)(38 are pera) (20)

with |r| the length of the Bloch vector of p. And the equality holds if and only if p is pure.

Theorem 7 demonstrates that the imaginarity of quantum state under a complete set
of MUBs is confined by the length of the Bloch vector of p (See FIG. 4). The relation in
Eq. (20) turns into the equality for qubit pure states. For any high-dimensional pure state,
there exists a real orthogonal matrix O that transforms it to a pure qubit state [15] [21].
Since real orthogonal transformations preserve the imaginarity measure of quantum states,

we have the following complete complementarity relation.

Corollary 2. For any d-dimensional pure state, there exists three sets of orthonormal bases
Y; (( =1,2,3) such that the imaginarity measure Mpe satisfies
5
(1— Mi)’ + (1—_Mg2)” + (1 — MR)” = 5. (21)
It should be noted that these orthonormal bases {Y;} are state-dependent as the real
orthogonal matrix O transforming high dimensional pure state to qubit pure state is state-

dependent. Here we show an example for this complemantarity relation in Eq. (21) in three

dimensional systems.

Ys = {9#2|0) + 9-2/1) + 312), 4-210) + A#2|1) + $12), $10) — $11) + 7512)}-

Under these three orthonormal bases Y,, Y2 and Y3, the imaginaries of |¢) are Mgi(|¢)) =
1— ae My2(\d)) = 0 and Mp3(|¢)) = 1- ae respectively. This gives rise to the comple-

mentarity relation in Eq. (21).

In qutrit systems, a complete set of MUBs can be constructed as follows:

Z, = {10), |1), 12).
Zy = {Zq(|0) + |1) +12), yy(l0) + w]1) +07 ]2)), Jy(l0) + w?|1) + w/2))}, (23)
Zs = {7q(|0) +u]1) +w]2)), Je(0) + w*|1) + [2)), "a, (0 ) + |1) + w?|2))},
Za = {7q(l0) +47I1) + 7/2), Fe(I0) + |1) + 12), Fe (10) + wl) + [2))},
where w = e% is the complex 3rd root of unity. In Appendix H, we shall prove the

complementarity relation of Mg. under the complete set of MUBs {Zp }=1,2,3,4-

Theorem 8. For any qutrit state p, the imaginarity measure Mp. under the set of MUBs
{Zi }e=123,4 satisfies

3 (1-Mz) > Pip). (24)
Theorem 8 shows the imaginarity under a complete set of MUBs is constrained by the
purity of quantum states. This complementarity relation is illustrated in FIG. 5 by 2000 ran-
domly generated states numerically, from which it follows that the left-hand side converges

to the right-hand side of Eq. (24) as the quantum state evolves toward purity.

randomly generated qutrits. The blue solid dots represent f = x (1 - Mg )’
corresponding to the left-hand side of Eq. (24) with respect to the anise P for randomly
generated qutrit states. The red line represents the function oP corresponding to the

right-hand side of Eq. (24).

The complementarity relations in Theorems 7 and 8 tell us that for any given quantum
state, the amounts of imaginarity can not be all large for the complete set of MUBs. More
specifically, since the complementarity relation in Theorem 7 is complete for pure state, so
the amounts of imaginarity under the MUBs B,, By and B3 can not be all large or small.

This relation reflects the dependence of imaginarity on the measurement basis.

V. CONCLUSIONS

To summarize, we have developed a method to construct imaginary measures by real part
state. This class of imaginary measures includes the existing imaginary measures in form of
the real part state. Specifically, we have proposed a new imaginarity measure in terms of
fidelity and explored its properties. In qubit systems, we have derived the analytical expres-
sion for the imaginarity measure. The relations between this imaginarity measure and some
other imaginarity measures have been established. The complementarity relation under a

complete set of MUBs have also been established in low-dimensional systems. This work

13
deepens the interpretation of the real part state on characterizing quantum states. Mean-
while, it also contributes to characterizing the dependence of imaginarity on measurement

bases.

VII. APPENDIX

Appendix A. The proof of Theorem 1

First, the faithfulness (M1) is obvious. Second, for any quantum state p and real operation

®, it has

M(®(p)) = D(®(p), Re(¥(p)))
D(®(p), ®(Re()))
D(p, Re(p))

= M(p),

IA

where the first equality is the definition in Eq. (5), the second equality is the property of
real operation ®, the inequality in the third line is the contractivity of the function D. So
M(p) satisfies the monotonicity (M2). Third, for arbitrary probability distribution {p;} and
density operators {p;},

M(pipi ® pop2) = D(pipr © p2p2, Re(pipi © p2p2))

= D(pipi © p2p2, p\Re(p1) © p2Re(p2))
pi D(p1, Re(p1)) + p2D(b2, Re(p2))
piM(p1) + poM(p2),

14
where the first equality is the definition of M(p) in Eq. (5), the second equality is the prop-
erty of real part, the third equality is the additivity under direct sum states of the function
D. So M(p) satisfies the condition (M5). Therefore M(p) is a well-defined imaginarity

measure.

Appendix B. The proof of Theorem 2

(1) First, since 0 < F'(p, Re(p)) < 1 and F(p, Re(p)) = 1 holds if and only if p = Re(p)
[24], this implies that Mp.(p) > 0 and Mp.(p) = 0 if and only if p is real. Second, it is well
known that the unique maximally imaginarity state is | +i) = noe for the imaginarity
resource theory [15]. Hence, it follows that Mpe(p) < Mre(| +i)(+i|) = 1—- v2

(2) Using Re(|w) (&|) = 4 (la) (| + |b*) (*|) and the expression for fidelity F(|y) (y|, p)
J/(vlele) with any pure state |y) and any density operator p [24], one obtains Mp.(|W)) =

1~ VTF IGE.

(3) Recall that in [21] the geometric imaginarity of a pure state |) is given as M,(

$)) =
$(1—|(w*|v)|). Combining with Eq. (7), it immediately follows that Mpe(|v)) = 1-

dg V1 + (1 — 2M).

its real part state is Re(p) = 5(L +1,0, +7,0,). Furthermore, it can be obtained that
det(p) = ifr det(Re(p)) = ierenre and Tr(pRe(p)) = retre Since the fidelity between

any qubit states p and o is F(p,0)? = 2,/det(p)det(o) + Tr(pa) [29], so we get

Appendix D. The proof of Theorem 4

First, recalling the definition of fidelity, we know F(p,p*) = Try/ p2p*p2 and
F(p, Re(p)) = Sa Try) p? + piptp?. For 0 < p < 1, the function f(x) = 2? is operator

concave [30], ie. for any quantum states p1,p2, and 0 <t <1, it has f((1—t)p: + tp2) >

(1—t)f(p1) + tf(p2). Let t = 4 and p = $, then we have ,/"4" > $,/p; + },/pz, and the
equality holds if and only if p; = p2. Therefore,

By applying the inequality (25) and Tr(p) = 1, it follows that
1 *
F(o,Re(p)) 2 5(1+ Flo, 6").

Therefore, by the analytical formula of the geometric imaginarity M, in Eq. (3) and the
definition of the imaginarity measure Mg, in Eq. (6), it is readily to get Mpe(p) < Mg(p)
and the equality holds if and only if p = p* i-e., p is a real state.

Second, the relation M,(p) < 1 — [1 — Mpre(p)]* is derived directly by F(p,Re(p)) <

F(p,0) =5 1 = |rP V1 — 2? P+ s(L+ are + 212),

where x? + z? < 1. For the sake of brevity, we denote G = F(p,c)?. Next we aim to find the

maximum of the function G(a, z) = 44/1 |rP V1 — 2? — 24 $(1+ar,+2rz) in the domain

{(x, z)|a? + 2? < 1}. We separate the discussion into two parts, one is on the boundary of
the domain {(x, z)|z? + 22 = 1}, and the other is inside the domain {(z, z)|x? + 2? < 1}.
On the boundary of the domain, by the Lagrange Multiplier Method, we find the maximum
of G is $( 1+ Jr2 +r). Inside the domain, by solving the stationary point of function G,
we find the maximum of G is 3/1 —r2 +1). By comparing these two cases, we get the
maximum of funtion G is $(,/1— 2+ 1) which is reached at (xo, zo) = ( Ja Jae) This

shows max F?(p,0) = 3(,/1— 7? + 1) and the optimal real state is 0, = $(I + to0x + 2002).

Appendix F. The proof of Theorem 6
Before the proof of Theorem 6, we need two lemmas below.

Lemma 1. For any quantum state p, the imaginarity measure of Mpe ts bounded from below

by

Mra(o) > 1~ | P(0) tlle riety P(e) (P00 + Heo) |

and from above by

Meal) <1 ~ | P(e) ~ Zllo~ p's +2V ExeRED|

where the Hilbert-Schimidt norm is given by ||A||y-s = \/Tr(ATA), the purity by P(p) =

Tr(p?), and Ey denotes the sum of the second-order principal minors of matrix.

17
Proof. In [31], one can obtain that the fidelity F(p, Re(p)) is bounded by

[L (p, Re(p))]? < F(p, Re(p)) < [U(p, Re(p))] (28)

with

U(p,0) = Tr(pa) + (1 — Tr(p?)) (1 — Tr (0?)) (29)

and

L(p,0) = Tr(p0) + V2y/ (Tr(po))? — Tr (pop0).

The trace Tr(pRe(p)) can be rewritten as Tr(pRe(p)) = 4 (Tr(o?) + Tr(pp*)) = Tr(e?) +
Tr ((Im(p))?) = P(p)—4||p—p"||i{_s- Inserting this relation into U(p, Re(p)) and L(p, Re(p)),

we get

Up, Re(9)) = Plo) ~ jlle riety Pip) [t= Pla)+ glle~ Pllh-s]» (0)
and

L(p, Re(p)) = P(p) — wile — p'|lh-s + 2V/Eo(pRe(p)), (31)

where we have used the relation (TrA)? = Tr(A?) + 2E(A) for L(p, Re(p)), H2(A) denotes

the sum of the second-order principal minors of matrix A [32]. Thus the lower and upper

bounds of Mp. can be derived.

Lemma 2. For any density operator p in a d-dimensional Hilbert space, we have

max U(p,0) < 5+ 55V4(d = 1)? = 2d(d = 1) (Tr(p?) — Tr(pp*)). (32)

Now we are ready to prove Theorem 6.
First, we can get F (p, Re(p)) > [P(p) — 4lle— ols]? by Eq. (31). Given the relation
between the trace norm and Hilbert-Schmidt norm ||.A||j,_s < ||A||%, we know F (p, Re(p)) >

[P(p) — Mu(p)?}? . This yields to Mpe(p) < 1 — (P(p) — Mir(p)?)?

Second, we know
