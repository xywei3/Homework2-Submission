SELF-SIMILAR BLOWUP FROM ARBITRARY DATA FOR
SUPERCRITICAL WAVE MAPS WITH ADDITIVE NOISE

IRFAN GLOGIC, MARTINA HOFMANOVA, AND ELISEO LUONGO

ABSTRACT. We consider stochastically perturbed wave maps from R!*+¢ into S?, in all
energy-supercritical dimensions d > 3. We show that corotational non-degenerate Gaussian
additive noise leads to self-similar blowup with positive probability for any corotational
initial data. The same result without noise is conjectured, but unknown, for large data.

1. INTRODUCTION

The wave maps equation represents a generalization of the linear wave equation to maps
that take values in Riemannian manifolds. More precisely, a map U from the flat Minkowski
spacetime (R!*4,7) into a Riemannian manifold (M, g) is called a wave map if it is a critical
point (under compactly supported perturbations) of the Lagrangian action functional

In contrast to the linear wave equation, the wave maps system (1.1) is inherently nonlinear
due to the curvature of the target manifold (IM, g). From a dynamical perspective, a general

Here, Greek indices go from 0 to d and Latin indices go from 1 to n, where n is the dimension of the target
manifold M. According to the Einstein summation convention, whenever an index variable appears twice in
a single term, once as a subscript and once as a superscript, it implies a summation over the understood range
of values for that index. We also note that the indices are raised and lowered according to the Minkowski

goal is to understand the interplay between the geometry of the target and the behavior of
solutions to the associated Cauchy problem (1.1). In particular, one of the central questions
is that of finite-time blowup:

Can smooth and localized initial data (Up,Uo) lead to singularity formation for (1.1) in
finite time?
Much research in the past fifty years has addressed this question, as we to some extent review
in Section 1.4 below. In this section we mention only (some of) the works relevant for our
main results below. We proceed by pointing out that, in the context of finite-time blowup,
there is a useful guiding principle based on the energy functional

EU (t) := I. 5° gi; U(t, X)) Call! (t, XO, (t, X)AX, (1.2)

which is formally conserved by solutions of the system, and the scaling transform U(t, X) >
U*(t, X) :=U(t/d, X/X), which preserves the wave maps equation (1.1). Namely, the func-
tional F transforms under the scaling U +> U* according to

EIU \(t) = XP EUW] (t/),

which shows that shrinking the solution locally (i.e., letting 1 — 0*) leads to local energy
dissipation precisely when d > 3. Singularity formation is therefore said to be energetically
favourable in the so-called energy-supercritical case, d > 3, and one therefore heuristically
expects finite-time blowup, at least for some large initial data. We remark in passing that
for the energy-subcritical case, d = 1, where local energy dissipation precludes concentration
of solutions, compactness of the target ensures coercivity of the energy E, which in turn
provides sufficient control over the wave maps flow to guarantee global regularity for any
smooth and localized initial data.

In this paper, we consider the energy-supercritical case of a canonical model of the wave
maps equation, where the target manifold is the d-dimensional sphere (S¢,h) endowed with
the standard round metric h induced by the embedding into R“!. For our analysis, it is
convenient to work with the so-called normal coordinates on S¢. Namely, for a function U/
with values in S¢, we consider the coordinate representation U = (U!,...,U%) where

Uu' :=00', for i=1,...,d,

with @ being the polar angle, and 9! the coordinate functions of the embedding S¢“! — R¢,
Concerning existence of blowup for this model, it is known that the corresponding wave maps
equation (1.1) admits, in all supercritical dimensions d > 3, an explicit self-similar solution
Ur, which is given in the normal coordinates by

Ui(t,X) = (5) X', with &(p) = = arctan ( _ 5) , (1.3)

and which forms singularity at the origin as t > T~. Originally identified by Turok and
Spergel in [62] for d = 3, this solution was subsequently generalized by Bizon and Biernat in
[7| to dimensions d > 4. We note that Up belongs to the class of the so-called corotational
solutions

Ui(t, X) = ult, |XX, i=1,...44. (1.4)

In fact, for initial data of corotational form
Uo(X) = ug(|X|)X and U(X) = tio(|XIX, (1.5)

(1.1) reduces by means of (1.4) to a Cauchy problem for a single (d + 2)-dimensional radial
semilinear wave equation for the profile u = u(t,r)

where ® is given in (1.3).

To understand the role that wr plays in the dynamics of (1.6), numerical simulations have
been performed, in [8] for d = 3, and in |7| for d > 4. Surprisingly, these have revealed a
striking universality in the blowup behavior:

For generic large corotational initial data, the solution blows up at the origin via the
self-similar profile ur.
In other words, irrespective of the choice of initial data (uo, fio) leading to finite-time blowup,
if one dynamically self-similarly rescales the solution as it approaches the blowup time, then
the profile ® emerges as an attractor of the rescaled evolution, i.e.,

(T —t)u(t,(T —t):) > © (1.8)

locally uniformly on [0,+00) as t > T~. This, in turn, translates for the corotational map
U into

U(t, (T — t)-) > ()®(|- 1), (1.9)
which takes place locally uniformly on R¢@ as t > T~. Following these observations, consider-
able effort has been devoted to their rigorous justification, starting with the pioneering works
of Aichelburg, Donninger, and Schérkhuber [28, 27, 31]. This line of research, which relies on
stability analysis localized to lightcones, eventually lead to a rigorous verification of, what
could be called, a perturbative local version of the numerical observations above. Namely,
for any fixed ball Br centered at the origin with radius R > 0, all corotational data that are
close enough to that of the blowup solution wr, lead to finite-time blowup with (1.9) taking
place uniformly on Br; see [18, 17, 14, 6, 30]. This was then followed by the work of the
first author [40], which takes the global-in-space stability point of view, and thereby removes
the assumption of a pre-fixed ball Br, hence establishing the convergence (1.8) globally on
[0, +00), and consequently obtains (1.9) uniformly on compact sets; see [40, Theorem 1.1|
for a precise, quantitative, statement of this result. The non-perturbative counterpart of
this result, i.e., the assertion that blowup is governed by ur for (generic) large data that are
not necessarily close to those of wr, is, however, open. Motivated by this, in this paper we
take a probabilistic point of view, that is, we consider the stochastic variant of (1.1) with
additive corotational noise. We then show that for arbitrary corotational initial data, the
corresponding solution does, in fact, blow up via (1.3) with positive probability.

1.1. Wave maps with additive noise. We consider the following stochastic evolution
equation on R¢
HOU + Ti (U)OHUIOU* = XW, i=1,...,4,
U(0,-) =Uo, (1.10)
AU (0, +) = Uo,
for an infinite dimensional Brownian motion W on a filtered probability space (Q, F, (F:):s0, P)
satisfying suitable assumptions described below; see Assumption 2.1 and Assumption 2.4.
To preserve the corotational structure of the solutions to (1.10), we assume that the noise W
lies in the space of radially symmetric functions, and the initial data are corotational, i-e.,
(1.5) holds for some radial uo, tig. Then, similarly to above, by setting U/(t, X) = u(t, |X|)X
and n = d+ 2, the system (1.10) reduces to a single stochastic scalar wave equation”

with radial data posed on R”. Accordingly, we exclusively study the dynamics of solutions
to (1.11), which we then ultimately translate back to the context of (1.10).

There are at least two additional motivations for studying the system (1.10). In realis-
tic physical models, idealized equations such as the wave maps system inevitably neglect
small-scale external perturbations, imperfections in the environment, and unresolved ran-
dom fluctuations. A standard modeling approach to incorporate such effects is to introduce
stochastic forcing terms. In the context of wave-type systems, additive noise has been em-
ployed to model, for instance, thermal fluctuations in plasma physics; see [43]. Following
this modeling philosophy, we consider perturbations by an additive noise term. The spe-
cific form of the noise, being proportional to the spatial variable X, is consistent with the
imposed corotational symmetry and preserves the geometric structure of the problem. This
choice ensures that the stochastic perturbation respects the corotational ansatz, and can be
interpreted as modeling small, isotropic ambient forces. Moreover, additive noise introduces
randomness independently of the solution itself, making it a clean model for external fluctua-
tions that do not alter the underlying geometric structure. Consequently, additive noise acts
as a “non-resonant” perturbation, allowing testing whether a mechanism of blowup is stable
in a probabilistic sense. This is particularly important in supercritical problems, where the
deterministic dynamics are often sensitive to small perturbations.

The past forty years have seen a substantial amount of research on wave equations under
stochastic forcing. Without aiming to be exhaustive, we refer to [11, 12, 24, 52, 15] and
references therein for some of the earliest works on the subject. For wave equations tak-
ing values in Riemannian manifolds, we mention [9, 10]. In situations where the equation
becomes singular and renormalization procedures are required, we refer to [3, 41, 42, 61].
Concerning local well-posedness of the stochastic equation (1.11) (or, equivalently, (1.10))
there are, to our knowledge, no currently available results. Accordingly, we first establish the
existence and uniqueness of solutions in suitable function spaces, and derive the associated
blowup alternative. We then proceed to analyze the stability of the blowup dynamics.

?For « = 0, the nonlinearity is interpreted in the limiting sense.

1.2. The main results. Due to the presence of noise, we have to work with a weak notion
of corotational solutions to (1.10). To this end, we first establish a well-posedness theory
for radial solutions to (1.11). For this, we adopt the functional framework developed by the
first author in [40] for the deterministic variant of (1.11), and consider the radial intersection
homogeneous Sobolev spaces

a

(R") 0 Afya(R") x Hag (R") 0 Hpag (R");
for a precise definition see Section 1.6 below. The basic solution concept we rely on is
that of a mild solution, as defined in, e.g., the classical monograph [23], to which we also
refer for the basic notation in stochastic analysis used throughout the paper. By denoting
u(t) := (u(t,-), @u(t,-)), we have the following well-posedness result, which we prove in

Section 2.1.
Theorem 1.1. Let n > 5 and s,k > 0 such that

2 2 an—4
Under Assumption 2.1, for each Fo-measurable random variable up = (uo, tio) with values in
He", there exist a strictly positive stopping time T*(ug) : Q > (0, +0] and a progressively

measurable process u: 2 x [0, +0) > H&*, such that:
i) For any positive stopping time tT < T*(uo), the stopped process u(- A T) belongs to
C({0, +00); H2*) P-a.s., and is a mild solution of (1.11) on [0,T].

ii) We have that

T*(uo,w) =+0 or  limsup |u(é)|
t>r*(ug,w)

yok = +00 P-a.s.

rad
Moreover, T*(ug) and u are unique in the following sense: if both (r#(uo), u') and (7X (uo), u?)
satisfy the conditions above, then T(uo) = T¥(Uo) P-a.s., and for any stopping time T <
Ti (uo) A T3(Uo), we have that

P(ul(ta rt) = w(t a7) Vt>0) =1.

Remark 1.2. The condition (1.12) on the Sobolev exponents s,k is imposed for several rea-
sons. First, the assumption s,k > }— 1 ensures that the associated heat semigroup in
similarity variables exhibits exponential decay. Additionally, if s is close enough to 5 — 1,
and k is a large enough integer, the nonlinear operator in (1.11) is Lipschitz continuous
in Hee. The two features above then allow for constructing local solutions by means of
straightforward fixed point arguments, which, in particular, avoid having to use sophisti-

cated dispersive equations tools like, e.g., Strichartz estimates.

Remark 1.3. To remove possible ambiguity, we provide below the exact definition of the mild
solution referred to in 7); see Definition 2.3.

Now, by means of Theorem 1.1 we can derive the analogous well-posedness result for the
system (1.10). For this, we consider spaces

He* = HS(R*) 0 H*(R4) x HR) 9 HRY),

and use the notion of corotational mild solutions to (1.10), for which we refer to Definition 2.3
below. Now, in view of the equivalence between Sobolev norms of corotational maps and

5
their radial profiles (see [39, Proposition A.5, Remark A.6]), we readily obtain the following
local well-posedness result for (1.10). We use the notation U(t) = (U(t,-), Ad(t,-)).
Corollary 1.4. Let d > 3 and s,k >0 such that

Under Assumption 2.1, for each Fo-measurable corotational random variable Uy = (Uo, Uo)
with values in H**, there exist a strictly positive stopping time T*(Up) : Q > (0, +00] and a
progressively measurable process U : Q x [0,-+%) > H®* such that:
i) For any positive stopping time t < T*(Ubo), the stopped process U(- A T) belongs to
C([0,+0);HS*) P-a.s., and is a corotational mild solution on [0,7] of (1.10).
ii) We have that

T*(Up,w) =+0 or  limsup |U(t)\a.% = +00 P-as.
)

tor* (Uo,w
Moreover, uniqueness holds in the following sense: if both (r#(Uo),U") and (t¥(Uo),U’)
satisfy the conditions above, then T(Uo) = 74(Uo) P-a.s., and for any stopping time T <
TE(Uo) A 73(Uo), it holds that

P(UN(tAT) =U7(t Ar) Vt> 0) = 1.

If the stopping time 7*(Up, w) above is finite, we say that the solution U (or UY) blows up
in finite time, and we call r*(Uo,w) the blowup time. Having a well-defined dynamics for
(1.10), as well as the corresponding blowup alternative, we are ready to state the central
result of the paper, which establishes the occurrence of self-similar blowup via Up with
positive probability for arbitrary data.

Theorem 1.5. Let d > 3 and s,k > 0 such that

Given Assumption 2.4, for any corotational initial data

and any positive number T, the unique solution to (1.10) in HS* given by Corollary 1.4
blows up with positive probability via Ur for some T < T. More precisely, for each choice of
Up given by (1.13) and T > 0, there exist a set N <Q of positive probability such that for
each we N the following hold:

i) = <7*(Uo,w) <T;

where z(t, |X|) is the solution of the linear wave equation with additive noise W (see

2
(2.4)) with zero initial data posed at t = z, and on N the profile Y satisfies

|L(t,-)layse 20 as t—or*(Up,w).
In particular, on N we have that
U(t, (T*(Uo,w) — 4) -) > (-)®(\-1)
locally uniformly on R4 as t > T*(Uo,w)-.

Remark 1.6. As will be evident from the proof, the value ft in the statement above may be

replaced with any 7; < 7. We have opted to avoid this additional level of generality in order
to simplify the notation.

1.3. On regularization by noise phenomena. Starting with the seminal works [64, 63],
it has become well established that the addition of noise to (partial) differential equations can
help prevent pathological behaviors such as non-uniqueness or blowup of solutions. We refer
in particular to [34, 22, 21, 53, 5, 4, 35, 16, 43, 1, 19] for various instances of the so-called
phenomenon of regularization by noise, including examples arising in the context of fluid
dynamics. The heuristic underlying these results is that pathological behaviors in (P)DEs
typically occur only along exceptional trajectories and are not generic. Consequently, a small
random perturbation can move the system away from them, thereby restoring uniqueness or
preventing blowup. For a detailed exposition of this idea, we refer to the lecture notes [33].

In light of the results mentioned above and the preceding discussion, Theorem 1.5 suggests
that the blowup profile U/p (or (-)®(|-|)) is not only in some sense generic but also that the
corresponding blowup mechanism is so robust that the addition of noise, at least in the
additive case, does not prevent the system’s pathological behavior. On the contrary, it
may even amplify it, as we are able to establish blowup for arbitrarily small initial data,
for which the deterministic dynamics would otherwise be globally well-posed. From this
perspective, our result is in line with those obtained for the Schrédinger equation in [25, 26],
where it was shown that the presence of smooth noise, whether additive or linear, provokes
blowup with positive probability for generic initial data. Unlike our work, however, [25, 26]
do not provide asymptotic information on the behavior of solutions near the blowup time.
We also point to works [50, 49], which investigate the effect of multiplicative noise on the
heat equation, demonstrating that such noise can induce blowup of solutions with positive
probability. Further examples of this phenomenon can be found in [38, 37, 36, 44].

We conclude by noting that, as with all previously cited results on blowup induced by
noise, we provide no information on the size of the probability of blowup. Furthermore, we
cannot assert that every instance of blowup occurs in a self-similar fashion. Although we
expect this to be the case, and moreover that P(r*(Uo) < T) > 1 as T > +, we have no
rigorous proofs.

1.4. Brief history of blowup for (deterministic) wave maps. Wave maps provide a
geometric generalization of geodesics to higher dimensions. More precisely, the wave maps
equation for maps from the flat Minkowski spacetime (R‘*4,7) into a Riemannian manifold
(M,g) defines a motion of the Euclidean space R¢ embedded into M, where in the extreme

case, d = 0, the system reduces to the geodesic equation. Unlike geodesics, however, wave
7
maps in general exhibit rich dynamical behavior, including the formation of singularities in
finite time.

For the energy-subcritical case, d = 1, blowup is actually ruled out for compact target
manifolds, regardless of their geometry. This simply follows from the strong well-posedness
of the one-dimensional wave maps at the energy regularity, together with the positive def-
initeness of the energy functional (1.2). For non-compact targets, however, there seems to
be no known results on the existence of blowup so far.

In the energy-critical case, d = 2, the fine geometric properties of the target manifold
become relevant, even in the compact case. For spherical targets, a remarkable series of
works has addressed the existence and stability of blowup; see, e.g., [47, 55, 54, 45, 46]. In
all these cases, the blowup mechanism is non-self-similar and corresponds to the so-called
bubbling off of a harmonic map. In contrast, for targets of constant negative curvature, e.g.,
the hyperbolic plane, blowup is known to be impossible; see, e.g., [60, 58, 59, 48}.

In the energy-supercritical case, d > 3, the construction of blowup is generally more
accessible, as self-similar solutions often exist. The earliest results in this direction are works
of Shatah and Tahvildar-Zadeh on rotationally symmetric targets with positive curvature
[56, 57|. For targets of constant negative curvature, on the other hand, the existence of
blowup remains a major open problem. However, when the assumption of constant curvature
is dropped and the target is merely required to have negative curvature, self-similar blowup
solutions have been constructed in sufficiently high dimensions; see, e.g., [13, 29].

1.5. Outline of the proof of Theorem 1.5. The proof is thematically divided between
Section 3 and Section 4. The main result of Section 3 is Theorem 3.1, which establishes
the nonlinear stability of the blowup mechanism of (1.3) for the stochastic system (1.10).
Loosely speaking, we show that if the initial data Uo are sufficiently close to Ur(0) for some
T > 0, where Up = (Up,Ur) denotes the explicit self-similar solution of (1.1)

i _aflAL\ xX xi as ang 3 (|X! x!

) and 8(9) = 810) + ob) (1.14)

ur fis) = 7a? (+ ;) , tnthrh = Beker) = aa? (75) ) (1.15)

then the corresponding solution U/ of (1.10) given by Corollary 1.4 blows up with a positive
probability at time T < 2T by converging to U;. The proof of Theorem 3.1 is based on
the now celebrated Da Prato-Debussche trick [20], combined with a deterministic stability
analysis in the spirit of [40]. First, by the representation

U(t, X) = ult, |X|) X (1.16)
and [39, Lemma A.5| we reduce the analysis to that of the dynamics of the radial profile u

evolving according to (1.11). Then, we define z as the stochastic convolution starting from
8

zero data for the linear wave equation (2.4). Consequently, as z is a regular object, in order
to study the blowup dynamics of (1.11), it suffices to analyze the behavior of

wi=Uu—z (1.17)

solving

@w — Aw Fra (lw + 2) sin(2|2|(w + 2))),

w(0) = up, (1.18)

6,w(0) = to,

for « € R”. From this point onward, we adopt the standard approach of studying the flow
near self-similar solutions by passing to similarity variables. More precisely, for a parameter

T, which is assumed to be close to T and to be fixed later, we consider the change of
independent variables

r=r(t): ios (=), € = €(t,2) := a

Furthermore, we define the new dependent variables (in their vector form)

Z(r,£) := (Z(r,€),Z(7,€)), for Z(r7,€) = (T —2)a(t,x) and Z(r,€) = (Tt)? A(t, 2),
W(r,€) := (W(r,€),W(1,8), for W(r,€) = (F —t)w(t,x) and W(r,€) = (T —t)* a(t, 2).

Throughout the paper, we use the ‘hat’ notation to shortly denote the partial derivative
with respect to the physical time ¢; in particular, above we have 2(t,x) := Oz(t,a) and
w(t, x) := Ow(t, x). The advantage of the new coordinate frame is that self-similar profiles
now become static, i.e., T-independent, and the problem of stability of self-similar blowup
in finite time, becomes the one of asymptotic stability of a steady-state solution (note that

T—>+0ast—T_). In the new variables, the first-order vector formulation of (1.18) takes
the form

0, W = LoW + n(W + Z),
~ (1.19)
W(0,-) = Wo(T),
where the linear operator Lo is given by
-1-€-V, 1
tn = | a oy -e.v/> (1.20)
the nonlinearity n is defined by
n(K) := (0,0(IX)), where no(K) = _ (2|-|K — sin(2|-|K)) for K = (K,K), (1.21)

and the trace of T shows up only in the initial data in the following manner
W,(T) := (Tw(0,T-), T?a(0,T-)) = (Luo(T-), T?tio(T-)).
We then proceed by analyzing stability of the static profile

® := (6,6)
9
under small perturbations governed by (1.19). Since the system is semilinear, we adopt a
perturbative approach based on spectral stability. In short, what we do is the following. We
consider the ansatz
W(r,:) = ®+ Wzs,:),

linearize around ®, and then use dynamical systems tools such as fixed point arguments and
Lyapunoy-Perron methods, along with spectral stability results from [40], to prove that for
any (to, fio) close enough to ur(0) and T close enough to T, the initial data (0,-) is small,
and there is, furthermore, a specific choice of 7’, possibly also depending on the realization of
the noise, such that the corresponding profile W is global and exponentially decaying. Then,
by undoing the similarity variables, we get that the solution w to (1.18) can be written for
te [0,7) in the following form

w(t, 2) 1 o(- ) =" (08 (=* ih ta :: (1.22)
T—t T—t Tt T-t/ T-t

where W(r,-) goes to 0 in H°*, as 7 > +00, for such realization of w. Consequently, we
conclude from the embedding H°", o L® that

(T —t)w(t,(T —t)-) > ®
globally uniformly on R” as t > T~; cf. numerical findings (1.8). Consequently, by (1.17)
the same applies to u, and by (1.16) to Y as well, though only locally uniformly. Now we
provide a more detailed overview of the above summarized argument, and concentrate the
discussion around the novelties brought about by the presence of noise.

Note that at least two differences arise between (1.23) and the system treated in [40]. One,
which is quite minor, is that here we do not restrict ourselves to the choice of T = 1 and
treat the general case of T’ > 0. The second, and much more fundamental, difference is the
appearance of Z-terms in (1.23) which are due to the presence of noise in (1.11). We note
that, in general, even when the noise W is smooth, it acts as an external forcing that may
break the stability of the self-similar profile ®. Nevertheless, under suitable non-degeneracy
assumptions on W, we show that this scenario does not occur with positive probability. In

particular, there exists a Te (F, xo), depending on the realization of the noise W and on
10
the initial condition uo, such that one can construct a global solution of (1.23) which decays
sufficiently fast to 0 in HS*, as T > +00.

The guiding principle of the argument sketched above, in analogy with [40], is that small
perturbations in H°"*, of the initial profile ur(0) still lead to blowup with positive probability,
namely on those realizations where the noise does not dominate the dynamics. We also
point out that, a priori, the solutions constructed via the ansatz (1.22) may exhibit poor
measurability properties, since for each realization of the noise the parameter T’ depends
on the entire realization of W, at least up to time aT. However, due to the uniqueness of
w solving (2.6), it suffices to show that objects of the form (1.22) also solve (2.6), thereby
recovering the corresponding measurability properties. Moreover, by the definition of the
stopping time 7*(up, w), it coincides with T on the subset of Q identified by this construction.

The main result of Section 4, stated in Theorem 4.1, informally asserts that if uo is
sufficiently regular, then for any T,¢ > 0 and any u; € He, the solution provided by
Theorem 1.1 has, with positive probability, no blowup before time 7 and, at time 7, lies in
the open ball of radius ¢ in °*, centered at u;. This is an irreducibility result for (1.11)
reflecting some ideas from [25, 32]. To implement our strategy, we first show that if u, is
sufficiently smooth, then there exists a smooth function f such that the solution of

n—3

u(0) = uo,
0,u(0) = to

coincides with u; at time 7. Secondly, we establish a form of continuity of the solution
map of the above system with respect to the controllers f. This is achieved by once again
exploiting the Da Prato—Debussche trick: we introduce z as the solution of the linear wave
equation (2.2) with forcing term 0;f, and w as the solution of (1.18) corresponding to this
choice of z. Then we show that if there already exists a solution of the deterministic system
(1.18) up to a deterministic time 7, then small perturbations of either the initial condition up
or the controller z still permit the construction of solutions to (1.18) up to time T. Moreover,
these solutions depend continuously on the data in C([0, 7]; Hee). With these two results
in hand, the irreducibility of (1.11) reduces to a support theorem for z, where we once
again make essential use of the non-degeneracy assumptions on the noise W. By combining
Theorem 3.1 with Theorem 4.1, we conclude the argument leading to Theorem 1.5.
Let us end the section by commenting on the restriction on the Sobolev exponents s, k

appearing in Theorem 1.1, Corollary 1.4 and Theorem 1.5. As already mentioned in Re-
mark 1.2, it guarantees that the nonlinearity in (1.11) is locally Lipschitz in Hee both in
physical and self-similar variables (see Lemma 2.2 below and [40, Lemma 7.1]), and that the

semigroup generated by the wave operator Lo exhibits exponential decay in Het. see [40,

Proposition 4.1, Proposition 6.2]. Additionally, if u = (u, a) ¢ H2%,, then u (resp. @) and its
derivatives up to order [$]—1 (resp. [$]—2) are uniformly continuous functions. Therefore,
U(X) = u(|X|)X is a well-defined object in H**, cf. [39, Proposition A.5, Remark A.6],
and it is possible to assign a precise meaning to (1.10).

Frequently used conventions. The reader might feel disoriented by the simultaneous
consideration of (1.10) and (1.11), as well as the fact we work with the former in both physical
and self-similar variables. In addition, the combination of the Da Prato—Debussche trick
and the self-similar ansatz, as described in Section 1.5, requires the introduction of several
additional objects for our analysis. To assist the reader, we summarize our conventions here,
providing a more compact overview of the notation used throughout the paper.

Due to the vectorial nature of the wave equation when viewed as an evolution equation, we
frequently deal with vector-valued quantities, where the second component is closely related
to the time derivative of the first component.’ As indicated in the table, we adopt the
convention that bold letters denote vector-valued quantities, while unbold letters represent
scalar quantities. When it is necessary to refer to specific components, we use the corre-
sponding unbold letter for the first component and the same letter with a hat for the second
component.

1.6. Notation. Let m > 3. We denote by C2(R™) the standard space of smooth and
compactly supported test functions on R”, .7(R™) the space of Schwartz functions on R™
and L?(IR™) the space of square integrable functions. We denote by ¢-,-) (resp. ||-||) the inner

We will work with Sobolev spaces, both homogeneous and non-homogeneous variants. We
denote by H7,,(R™) the closure of CZ,,q(R™) with respect to the standard H’(IR™) topology.

it differs from n = d+ 2.

2. PRELIMINARIES

This section collects several auxiliary results needed for the proof of Theorem 1.5. In Sec-
tion 2.1 we introduce the basic notation for the linear wave equation and provide proofs
of Theorem 1.1 and a support theorem for the stochastic convolution originating from zero
initial data. Section 2.2 then turns to the analysis in self-similar variables, and recalls the
main elements of the linearized and spectral framework introduced in [40].

2.1. Analysis in physical variables: well-posedness and stochastic convolution.
Denote by T(t) the semigroup associated with the linear wave equation and by A its infin-
itesimal generator. According to [51, Chapter 7.4], these operators are well defined both in
homogeneous and non-homogeneous Sobolev spaces and preserve radial symmetry. Hence,
for each r2 > r, > —$ + 1, T(é) is a bounded linear operator on H717;? (resp. H") and its
infinitesimal generator

A: D(A) CH}? > Hiv? (resp. A: D(A) CH" > H")

satisfies D(A) = H"%?*" (resp. D(A) = H+). For smooth initial data up = (uo, tio), the

function u(t) = (u(t), @(t)) = T(£)uo is the unique solution of the wave equation

O?u = Au,
u(0) = uo, (2.1)

Consider a complete filtered probability space (Q,F, (F:):50, P) with right-continuous filtra-
tion, and fix s,k as in Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.5. The Brownian motion W appearing
in (1.11) is assumed to satisfy different, increasingly restrictive conditions depending on
whether the focus is on local well-posedness, i.e., Theorem 1.1 and Corollary 1.4, or also on
the blowup properties, i.e., Theorem 1.5. In the former case, the following assumption is
imposed.

Assumption 2.1. Let W be an infinite-dimensional Brownian motion adapted to (F;)iso0

. « ers—1,k—-1
with values in Hyg.

More explicitly, W is P-a.s. continuous process taking values in i lee if U is aseparable
Hilbert space and B; a cylindrical Brownian motion on U, there exists J € L(U; H°4'""')
such that JJ* has finite trace and

W, = SBi. (2.3)
Under these assumptions on W, it follows from [23] that the stochastic wave equation
Oz =Az+W,
2(0) = 0, (2.4)
0,2(0) = 0,

sk

admits a unique mild (equivalently, weak) solution z € C([0, +00); Hi74

), which satisfies

2(0) =0 Wi = (0,Wi), (2.5)

14
and is given by the mild formulation
t
a(t) = I T(t — s)dW,.
0
We now turn to properties of the nonlinearity in (1.11). Let n and no be as defined in (1.21).
Then no satisfies the following estimate on H*-)*,
Lemma 2.2. Letn > 5 and s,k > 0 satisfy

The desired estimate then follows from the Schauder estimate [40, Proposition A.1] with
F(h) := 7/"(h) = 8cos(2h).

From Lemma 2.2, one immediately obtains an analogous estimate for n on He. In
particular, if ue H°, then n(u) is well defined as an element of H°%. With these definitions
in place, we recall for the reader’s convenience the notion of a mild solution to (1.11), referring
to [23] and [2] for further details.

Definition 2.3. Let up = (uo, tio) be an Fo-measurable random variable with values in Hevas
and let 7 be a stopping time. A progressively measurable process u : 2 x [0, +2) > Hee is
called a mild solution of (1.11) on [0,7] if ue C([0,7];H24) P-a.s. and satisfies
t t
u(t) = T(t)uo + I T(t — s)n(u(s)) ds + I T(t — s) dW., P-a.s. for all t € [0,7].
0 0
15
Furthermore, a progressively measurable process U = (U U ):Q x [0, +00) + H®* is called
a corotational mild solution of (1.10) on [0,7] if it is induced by a mild solution u = (u, &)
of (1.11) through

ui(t,X) = ult,|X)X*, W(t, X) = a(t, |XX
We are now in a position to state the local well-posedness result for (1.11).

Proof of Theorem 1.1. We employ a fixed point argument and look for solutions of

u(t) = T(t) + I

0

t t

T(t — s)n(u(s))ds + | T(t — s)dW,.

Due to the regularity of W,, we define

a(t) = [ T(t — s)dW, € C([0, +0); He) P-as.

Then, finding a solution u is equivalent to solving the fixed point problem

We aim to show that I’ has a fixed point in the closed ball of radius 1+ (M + 1)r(w) in
C((0, T*(w)]; H2%,) for sufficiently small T*(w). For notational simplicity, we omit the w in
what follows. Since T(t) is a strongly continuous semigroup on He, it follows immediately
that I[h] € C([0, +00); H2",) whenever h € C([0, +00); H°",). Moreover, by Lemma 2.2

if T* is sufficiently small. Hence, [ maps the closed ball of radius 1 + (M + 1)r into itself.
Next, we verify that [ is a contraction. Using the properties of the wave semigroup, we have

for possibly smaller T*. This implies by standard arguments all the claims. In particular,
the construction implies that 7* > 0 P-a.s.
16

In order to prove our main result, Theorem 1.5, we need some additional properties of z,
both in terms of its regularity and the support of its law. To this end, we introduce the
following assumption.

Assumption 2. 4 Let W be an infinite-dimensional Brownian motion, adapted to (F;):50,
a

with values in HS . Moreover, we assume that W is non-degenerate on H,,

By non-degeneracy, we mean that the support of W coincides with the full space Wo. Pe
for each choice of a, p,T satisfying

TF = 0; ae (0,5), pe(2,+0), ap>l.

This property holds provided that the operator J appearing in (2.3) satisfies

Je L(U; Ht “By, JJ* has finite trace and Ker(J*) = {0}.

rad

Under this assumption, which is more restrictive than Assumption 2.1, we have
2 € C((0, +90); HF),

The following lemma, concerning the support of z, the solution of (2.5), is likely well-known
to experts. However, since we were unable to find a suitable reference, we provide a proof
for completeness.

Lemma 2.5. Let T > 0 and suppose that Assumption 2.4 holds. If z is the mild solution of
(2.5) on [0,T], then the support of z is the full space E}.p.

Since z* is smooth, there exists f* € Wo7-"" such that

or equivalently

Moreover, the solution map is continuous from Ws. a to Efr. Therefore, there exists a

of the wave equation with forcing 0; f ** which we denote by z**, satisfies

In conclusion, we have

The latter is positive, due to the properties of the support of the Brownian motion W.

2.2. Analysis in self-similar variables: linearized dynamics. As explained in Sec-
tion 1.5, to study the stability of self-similar solutions, it is convenient to pass to similarity
variables, thereby reformulating the wave maps equation in these coordinates. Additionally,
in this section we recall some properties of the wave operator in these variables, referring to
[40, Sections 4~7] for detailed proofs.

For T' > 0 we define the new time and space variables

P x

U(r, €) = (F—tult,x), U(7,8) := (PT — t)*ai(t, 2).

The function U = (U, U ) then formally satisfies the evolution equation

Ie = LoU + n(U)

wld) = Up (2.8)

where Lo is the wave operator in similarity variables, as defined in (1.20). According to
[40, Proposition 4.1], the operator Lo, originally defined on smooth functions, is closable on
H°",, and its closure generates a strongly continuous semigroup So(7) on H2*,.. We now
decompose the solution in self-similar variables as

U=64+ 8,

where ® is the static self-similar profile associated with the nonlinear wave map introduced
in (1.14). By construction, ® generates a blowup solution of (1.6) under the self-similar
rescaling. The perturbation V then satisfies
0,W = LY +N(P)
W(0) = Up - ,
18
where L and N are defined in (1.25) and (1.26), respectively. As shown in [40, Sections 5-6],

the operator L, like Lo, is closable on H°%,, and its closure generates a strongly continuous

semigroup S(r) on H°"). Most importantly, there exists @ € (0,s + 1— §) such that
{A € o(L) : ReA > —} = {1}. (2.9)

Moreover, eigenvalue 4 = 1 is simple and it does not correspond to a genuine instability as
it arises from the time-translation symmetry of (1.15). The corresponding eigenfunction can
thereby be explicitly computed, and is given by
1

g:=(9,€-Vgt2g9), 9(§) 2tn—4
Consequently, due to the underlying spectral mapping relation between S(r) and its gener-
ator L, we have that

3. STABLE SELF-SIMILAR BLOWUP PROFILE FOR STOCHASTIC COROTATIONAL WAVE

The main goal of this section is to establish the following perturbative blowup result.

there exists a set N < Q of positive probability, such that for all w € N the unique corota-
tional mild solution U of (1.10) given by Corollary 1.4, satisfies 0 < T*(Uo,w) < 2T, and,
moreover, we have the following decomposition

In particular, on N it holds
U(t, (T*(Uo,w) — H)) > ()®( - |)
locally uniformly on R*. As a consequence, with positive probability, the solution U(t) blows
up in a self-similar way before T.

3.1. Change of Variables. Let z be the stochastic convolution starting from 0, as defined
in Section 2.1, and let ® be the background self-similar profiles defined in (1.14). As discussed
in Section 1.5, for each 0 < T' < 2T, we introduce the change of variables

and define

(,t):= = ®|= C ———__—

Z(7,€) = (T —t)z(t ),
Z(r,€) = (T —2)?4(t, 2),
Z(r,€) := (Z(1, 8), 2(7,8), (3.2)

Writing u= @+2+ y with ~ = 0,4), we define

U(r,6) = (T-tv(t,2), Wr, :=(T-t)d, (t,2),¥ = (¥,¥).
Then W satisfies (1.23) with initial data (1.24). Thus, to prove Theorem 3.1, it suffices to
study the system (1.23) pathwise. The existence of a positive-probability set follows from
Lemma 2.5, which ensures that z has the required properties, together with the fact that z
is independent of Fo.

where @ is from the previous section; see (2.9). Let ¥, (resp B,, CrB,) denote the closed
ball of radius r in Y (resp. H*,, C((0,2T]; H’* *"¥)) and P be the Riesz projection of L
associated to the eigenvalue 1. We study (1.23) for a generic initial condition v ¢ H°", using a
Lyapunov—Perron type argument. For v € He, Ke 2X, Ze C((0, +0); He), Z=(Z, Z),
define

where Z is obtained from z via the change of variables (3.2). This is the content of the
following lemma.

Lemma 3.2. For all sufficiently small 6 > 0 and all sufficiently large C > 0, the following
holds. If v € Bsc and 2¢€ CrByyc, then there exits a unique UW € X5 such that

Moreover, the map (v,z) > W is Lipschitz continuous from Bsyc x —_— into Xs.

Both expressions (3.6) and (3.7) will be used in the following analysis. 7
The result of Lemma 3.2 applies to our initial condition W, 7, provided that T is suffi-
ciently close to T and that the perturbation of the initial data is small in the sense that

It remains to show that there exists a choice of T such that

By the definition of the map C(U (T , Uo, Uo), V7, Z7), it is sufficient to show that there exists

second component of Z, and by the continuity of the solution map, cf. Lemma 3.2, we also
have Wj, > Wy, in ¥ as T, > To. Combining this information with the estimates (3.3),
(3.4) and (2.11), implies that Ro(z, up — ®, 7) is continuous in T. Moreover, by (3.3), (3.4)

Hence, by taking 6 > 0 sufficiently small and N > 0 wey large, we can ensure

Therefore, F' is continuous and, by choosing 6 > 0 sufficiently small and N > 0 sufficiently
large, it maps [T — 4, T+ =] into itself. The Brouwer fixed-point theorem then guarantees
the existence of a fixed point, completing the proof.

|Ri(uy — &, T)| + |Ro(z, up — ®,T)| <

Lastly, we need a lemma that relates the mild solution constructed in self-similar variables
to that obtained in physical variables. Indeed, we have shown that there exists a unique
mild solution W to (1.23). Moreover, since ® is a classical solution of (2.8), it is also a mild
one. Consequently, their sum is a mild solution of (1.19). The following result establishes

the link between this solution and the fixed points of (2.6).

Substituting this expression into (3.9) yields the claim.

The proof of Theorem 3.1 now follows directly from Lemma 3.4 and Lemma 3.5.

Proof of Theorem 3.1. Let us first select 6 > 0 and N > 0 so that the assumptions of
Lemma 3.4 are satisfied, and choose ¢ in the statement of Theorem 3.1 small enough such
that

6
P (ju — ur(0,-)| sk, < x) >0.

Consequently, by Lemma 2.5 and the independence of z from Fo, there exists a measurable
set of positive probability, denoted by N3,n, such that

such that the claim of Lemma 3.4 holds, moreover 4 < z. Since W + ® is a mild solution of
(1.19), it follows from Lemma 3.5 and uniqueness of the mild solutions for (1.11) (see also

Theorem 1.1) that, on the set N,v we have the following representation

Consequently, T'(w) coincides with the blowup time 7*(U,w) for every w € Nyy. Hence,

for all t < T. From (3.10), we immediately deduce that: ||u(t)|

_ <T*Uo,w)lngy < Sf.

and the first component of the unique corotational mild solution of (1.10), provided by
Corollary 1.4, satisfies (3.1). To establish the final claim, we combine the representation
(3.10) with the definition of Vs; and the embdedding of He

4, IRREDUCIBILITY OF THE STOCHASTIC COROTATIONAL WAVE MAPS

This section is devoted to establishing the second key component in the proof of Theorem 1.1,
ie., the following result.

Theorem 4.1. Suppose that Assumption 2.4 holds and let

This result establishes the irreducibility of the stochastic system (1.11). As a direct conse-
quence, it implies that, with positive probability, the blowup of u can be prevented up to
time t. The proof proceeds in two steps: (i) an approximate controllability argument, and
(ii) continuous dependence of the solution map on the controls.

sko< €) > 0.
rad

4.1. Approximate controllability. We study the translated nonlinear wave map
dpw — Aw = oa 3 (2\a|(w + z) — sin(2|2|(w + z))),
w(0) = uo, (4.1)

where z is, as before, the stochastic convolution associated with the wave equation. We
adopt (4.1) instead of the more standard formulation
u(0) = uo, (4.2)

0,u(0) = tio,

since w enjoys better continuity properties with respect to z than u does with respect to f.
For convenience, we define, for any T; > 0,

gpk {z= = (2,8) € C([0, Ti]; #4) : 2(0) = (0) = 0, 24) = [ eeu.

This is a aes Banach space if endowed with the topology of C([0,T;];H°",). Here, the

equality z( = fh als s)ds has to be understood in the sense of tempered distributions, i.e. in
-%', Now we can prove the approximate controllability result for equation (4.1).
Pagppsthiant 4.2. For any T, > 0 and uo = (to, tio), wr = (1, %%) € HS? x Ae
Ho", there exists z € ey, such that w = (w,0,w) solving (4.1) exists on [0,T1] and satisfies
w(0)=uo, w(7i) +2(T1) = uw.
Proof. Without loss of generality, let us assume 7, = 1. We aim to construct u = (u, Ou)
such that
u(0) = uo, u(1) = wi, Ou(0) = Go, Cu(1) = &.
28
Since four conditions must be satisfied, it is clear that if wu is taken as a cubic polynomial
in time, the coefficients can then be chosen to meet all the conditions. However, in order to
relax the regularity assumptions on Up and uj, and to construct z and w such that u = z+w,
with both z and w satisfying the requirements of the statement, it is necessary to modify
the polynomial behavior through a suitable regularization procedure. With this in mind,
and with a slight abuse of notation, let P(t) denote the semigroup on H!_, associated to the
infinitesimal generator A—I : D(A—1) = H!,40 Hi] CH! > Hig for each 1 > —3. Let
u(t) = (1+ 203 — 3t?) up + (3 — 2t)u
(3 — 2t) (Z-— A)“! — I-A)? + Z- A) P P(A) 0

—(1— A)" (tP(.—t) + (F— A) P= t) — 7 — A) P()) fr,
a(t) = eu(t), u(t) = (u, a(t).
Then, clearly, u(0) = uo, u(1) = u;. Moreover, we have the regularity

ue C({0, 1]; He hk+ 2) ae C((0, 1]; Fey,

rad rad

b

Next, define
a

F(t) = (t) — -| (Au(s) + no(u(s))) ds, F(t) = (0, f()-

0

By the regularity of u, a, together with Lemma 2.2, we have f € C([0, 1]; H*,/""). Therefore

Now set
z(t) = F(t) + [ T(t— s)AF(s)ds.
It is straightforward to check that z sattities
{ =Az+0,F
z(0) = 0,

and that u together with F solves equation (4.2). In particular, due to the smoothness of
F, we have

z€C((0,1];H2")).

rad

The claim follows.

4.2. Continuity of the solution mapping along the controllers. The main result of
this section is the following.

Proposition 4.3. Let up € H°*, and z € Eee be such that there exists a unique solu-
tion w € C({0,Ti];He",) to (4.1). Then, there exist neighborhoods Hy © H&*, of uo and

Zo rae of z such that for any Up € Ho and Z € Zo, there exists a unique solution

Ho x Zo into C((0,Ti];H2%).

Proof. We divide the proof into two steps.
Step 1: Preparation. Let M > 1 be the constant appearing in (2.7). We first show the
existence of a time T* = T*(r, R) such that for any

|| wo] wt, ST ll2lleqorjaes) <R,

there exists a unique solution w to (4.1) belonging to the closed ball of radius (M + 1)r in

to show that I’, is a contraction. Using the properties of the wave semigroup on He va We
have

provided that T* is sufficiently small. This choice of T* may be smaller than in the previous
step, but it depends only on r and R.
Similarly, we can solve (4.1) on any interval [T*(r, R)k, T*(r, R)(k+1)] for k € {0, oe Ey Ine}

dition and the time interval considered, we denote by w Z, Ux,*) the unique solution of

depends continuously on u, and z in C([T*(r, R)k, T*(r, R)(k+1)];He%,). Indeed, since P.,
is a contraction of constant 4 in the relevant parameter range, by Lemma 2.2 we have

the continuity of the solution map in (uo, z). Replacing (uo, z) by any element in Ho, Zo the

rest of the claim follows.

The latter probability is strictly positive due to the non-degeneracy of the noise W, i

before aT = ft with positive probability. Due to pathwise uniqueness of solutions for (1.10)
guaranteed by Corollary 1.4, it follows that (t+) coincides with U(t) on No. Consequently,
U(t) also blows up in a self-similar way with positive probability before E+ aT =T. Finally,

defining
