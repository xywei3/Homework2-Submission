We present a revised atomistic picture of the order—disorder transition in the archetypal orbital-
ordered perovskite material, LaMnO3. Our study uses machine-learning-driven molecular-dynamics
simulations which describe the temperature evolution of pair distribution functions in close agree-
ment with experiment. We find the orbital-disordered phase in LaMnO to comprise a mixture of
differing structural distortions with and without inversion symmetry, implying a mixture of different
orbital arrangements. These distortions are highly dynamic with an estimated lifetime of ~ 40 fs at
1,000 K, and their fluctuations converge with the timescales of conventional thermal motion in the
high-T phase — indicating that the electronic instability responsible for static Jahn—Teller distortions
at low temperature instead drives phonon anharmonicity at high temperatures. Beyond LaMnO3,
our work opens an avenue for studying a wider range of correlated materials.

Orbital correlations can play a key role in determining
electronic and magnetic properties of materials. In many
transition-metal compounds, the occupation of d-orbitals
and their orientations control overlap, which influences
electronic transport and magnetic coupling. These or-
bital arrangements can be crystallographically ordered
or disordered, and the balance between the two extremes
can be critical to emergent phenomena such as supercon-
ductivity [1, 2], colossal magnetoresistance [3-5], charge-
orbital ordering [6], and ferroelectricity [7]. Therefore,
understanding orbital-ordered and -disordered states in
crystalline solids is an important research objective.
While the long-range ordered structural distortions in-
duced by orbital ordering can be directly deduced from
bulk diffraction studies [8, 9], it is much more difficult
to describe orbital- disordered states, both experimentally
and computationally. In general, three pictures are usu-
ally considered for orbital-disordered phases. The first
is that of an orbital liquid or glass, where local orbital
correlations resemble those of a low-temperature ordered
state, but correlated only over finite lengthscales (e.9.,
domains) [10, 11]; the second is a correlated-disorder
model, in which the disordered state supports orbital cor-
relations not found directly in the related ordered state
12]; and the third involves suppression of structural dis-
ortions through a displacive transition [13-15]. Differ-
entiating these descriptions requires probes that are sen-
sitive to the local distortions in the orbital-disordered
hase and their corresponding dynamics.

The archetypal orbital-ordered system is LaMnO, [10],
which contains Mn*+ with a (t2,)%(e,)! high-spin con-
figuration. Under ambient conditions, the compound
adopts a perovskite structure in which each [MnOg] oc-
ahedron is Jahn-Teller (JT) distorted to have two long,
wo medium, and two short Mn-O bonds. The distor-
ions order such that two opposing long Mn—O bonds al-
ernate orientations between two orthogonal directions,
in a way that repeats along a third direction (“C-type”
ordering) [16]. This anisotropy is evident in the or-
horhombic strain of LaMnO 3. Above 750 K, the lat-
ice parameters collapse to yield a pseudo-cubic phase in

which the JT distortion is apparently quenched [9]. How-
ever, local-structure probes show that the asymmetry in
Mn-O bond-length distributions remains after the tran-
sition, which was interpreted as there being no change
in the Mn-O bond lengths with increasing T. The im-
plication is that the JT distortions persist, but now in
a crystallographically disordered manner which, on aver-
age, gives the observed pseudo-cubic phase [11, 17].
Experiments have yielded conflicting descriptions of
his order—disorder transition. Resistivity and thermo-
electric measurements of the orbital-disordered phase of
LaMnO, led to an interpretation involving dynamic co-
operative JT distortions, in which the C-type order fluc-
uates above 750 K [10]. Additionally, a model con-
aining nanoregions of static C-type order was proposed
based on neutron pair distribution function (PDF) anal-
ysis [11]. In contrast, a three-state Potts (“3SP-type”
model, which allows the two opposing long Mn—O bonds
o align along all three principal axes, was found to repro-
duce the behavior of LaMnO3 in resonant X-ray scatter-
ing (12, 18]. Furthermore, reverse Monte-Carlo (RMC)
fits to PDFs calculated from X-ray and neutron diffrac-
ion experiments yielded a model with the long bonds in
che JT-distorted octahedra aligning perpendicularly to
each other (“L-type” ordering) [19]. Notably, the PDFs
showed a discontinuous change at 750 K, indicating that
he high-T’ phase has a different local structure to the or-
dered one. However, the conclusions were not definitive
as the differences between fits to high-T’ PDF data using
C-type, 3SP-type, and L-type models were not meaning-
ful in the presence of strong thermal fluctuations [19].

The orbital order—disorder transition in LaMnO3 is
similarly difficult to interpret using computations. First-
principles studies indicated that the transition is multi-
‘aceted, involving a combination of octahedral rotations,
antipolar distortions of the A-site cations (La?+) and,
importantly, a compressive tetragonal shear strain on
he lattice stabilizing the cooperative JT distortions in
he low-T antiferromagnetic phase [20]. Comparing the
computed energies of different magnetic orderings in the
high-T paramagnetic phase shows that antiferromagnetic

(AFM) ordering yields a stronger stabilization of the JT
distortion modes than ferromagnetic ordering. This sta-
bilization results in an improved prediction of the transi-
tion temperature, implying that spin symmetry breaking,
and thus dynamics, affect the transition. While these
simulations have allowed the study of distortion modes
and magnetic ordering in LaMnOs, they have been lim-
ited to relatively small system sizes.

Here, we use large-scale, machine-learning-driven
molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations to re-examine the
microscopic nature of orbital order and disorder in
LaMnO3. We first validate our simulations by computing
the temperature evolution of average structural param-
eters and PDF's, comparing to experimental data. We
then analyze the evolution of JT distortions with temper-
ature, demonstrating that the high-T’ phase of LaMnO,
actually adopts a mixture of the orbital orderings from
the 35P-type and L-type models. Finally, by comput-
ing the time-dependent evolution of the amplitudes of
JT distortions, we show that these distortions become
dynamic with increasing temperature and that their life-
times shorten to the same timescale as thermal fluctua-
tions at 1,000 K. Hence the apparent persistence of JT
distortions in orbital-disordered LaMnOs is really a sig-
nature of JT-driven bond anharmonicity.

Our MD simulations are driven by a machine-learned
interatomic potential (MLIP). Recent advances in on-
the-fly-accelerated first-principles MD [21-23] provide a
route for the efficient generation of training data for
MLIPs [24, 25]. We here parameterized an MLIP model
using the NequIP architecture [26, 27] together with
an existing dataset of 1,384 LaMnOs structures from
Ref. 28, generated initially from a 100 — 1,100 K heat-
ing run of a 2 x 2 x 2 cubic unit cell with AFM ordering
[28]. For MD simulations, the isothermal-isobaric (NPT)
ensemble was used with a Nosé-Hoover thermostat and
barostat as implemented in LAMMPS [29].

To validate the MLIP model, we computed key struc-
tural parameters and compared their change with tem-
perature to the experimental data of Ref. 19 (Fig. 1). A
6 x 6 x 6 expansion of the cubic unit cell was used for
a heating simulation from 200 to 1,200 K at a rate of
1 K/ps at constant atmospheric pressure. Reduced cell
parameters were calculated using equations outlined in
Ref. 28, and the tilting angle, y, along the (111) axis
was calculated using the O-O-O angles 6; and 62 ac-
cording to the methods in Refs. 33 and 34. The average
structural parameters were obtained from a trajectory
with a time averaging of 0.1 ps. For the lattice param-
eters, a moving average was calculated and overlaid on
the time-averaged values. The tilting angles and bond
lengths were averaged over all 256 octahedra within the
supercell. Overall, Fig. 1 shows excellent agreement be-
tween simulated and experimental data: in particular,

the orthorhombic/pseudocubic transition associated with
orbital order/disorder is replicated. The temperature at
which this transition occurs is underestimated by ~ 60 K,
which may be due to the underlying DFT level [20, 28].
With increasing T, the lattice parameters collapse to sim-
ilar values accompanied by a decrease in shear strain [35],
he octahedral tilting decreases, and the JT distortions
appear to be suppressed. At ~ 1,200 K, the tilting pat-
ern changes to a a~a_, consistent with a transition to

he rhombohedral phase as observed experimentally [35].

Next, we calculated averaged PDFs from structures
sampled from 10 ps MD runs. Neutron and X-ray
PDFs were predicted using DebyeCalculator [30] us-
ing reciprocal-space ranges, real-space resolutions, and
damping parameters from Ref. 19. Figure 2 shows that
he calculated PDFs agree remarkably with experimen-
al data from Ref. 19, indicating that the simulation cap-
ures the change in local structure within the tempera-
ure range. Notably, it replicates the change in peaks
corresponding to the Mn—O bonds, from two split peaks
0 a broad single peak at ~ 2 A. While the changes in
attice parameters, volume, and Mn-O bond lengths have
een previously simulated [12, 20, 31, 32], this is the first
ime that the experimental PDFs for LaMnOz ~ and their
evolution across the order/disorder transition — have been
replicated from first principles.

Overall, Figs. 1 and 2 show that the temperature de-
endence of both average and local structure in LaMnO,
is well described by our simulations. This observation

justifies now using the atomistic configurations to explore
he nature of orbital order and disorder in LaMnOs. Fig-
ure 3 shows the orientations of the respective two longest
Mn-O bonds in each [MnOg] octahedron with tempera-
ure, as well as snapshots of slices in the zy-plane. The
MD trajectory has been time-averaged with a window
of 0.1 ps to remove thermal fluctuations. We found
hat larger time-averaging windows resulted in the bond
engths averaging out in the high-T’ phase due to the con-
stant fluctuation of long-bond orientations [35]. As tem-
erature rises, the system undergoes a drastic change,
losing the C-type order and adopting a crystallographi-
cally disordered configuration. Unexpectedly, the high-T
hase consists of ~ 50% of L-type distortions and the re-
maining distortions having opposing long bonds aligning
along all three axes in equal proportions. This result is
consistent with the meaningful change in local structure
observed in experimental PDFs [19], but is a markedly
different picture than previously considered.

To draw a comparison to other materials, a clear

change in local structure is also apparent from PDFs for
orbital order transitions in the layered nickelates, LiNiO,
[14] and NaNiO, [15]: the Ni-O peaks broaden and merge
with increasing temperature, similar to the Mn—O peaks
in LaMnO3. However, the change in the Ni-O peaks was
interpreted to be due to the JT distortions disappearing,
in contrast to the canonical understanding of the behay-

ior of LaMnO,. We can investigate this difference in in-
terpretation by calculating the magnitude of the JT dis-
tortions of each octahedron through Van Vleck vibration
modes, using VanVleckCalculator [37]. We focus on the
E, distortion space which is spanned by a planar rhombic
Q2 component (compression of two bonds and stretching
of two bonds) and a tetragonal Q3 component (compres-
sion of four bonds and stretching of two bonds). Figure
4a shows the evolution of the distributions of the octahe-
dral distortions from snapshots of a 14 x 14 x 14 supercell
heated for 10 ps at each temperature. At 400 K, there
are two high-intensity regions showing that there are two
major orientations of the JT distortions, as expected for
C-type ordering. At 500 K, these regions are broader
and closer together in distortion space. When slices of
the 500 K configurations are visualized with color-coding
based on the amplitude of the Q2 component (Fig. 4b),
we see mostly C-type ordering, but a small proportion of
the octahedra have near-zero Q2 amplitudes. At 1,000 kK,
the heatmap in Fig. 4a shows a clear centering around
(0,0), and the majority of the octahedra have reduced
Qo- or Q3-amplitudes (~ 45% within +0.05 A). Slices
of the 1,000 K configurations show essentially complete
melting of the original C-type order.

The unimodal distribution of octahedral distortion
types we observe is inconsistent with previous interpreta-
tions based on the 3SP model [32], for which the (Q2,Q3)
heatmap would show three maxima at high tempera-
ture, corresponding to JT distortions aligned along the
three principal axes. Hence, our results indicate that the
high-temperature phase of LaMnO3 involves suppression
of the conventional JT distortion of [MnO,] octahedra
on long timescales. The broadening and merging of the
Mn-O peaks in the PDFs is probably a signature of this
local-structure transition. Indeed, this interpretation has
much in common with that of JT suppression in LiNiO,
[14] and NaNiO, [15].

Next, we ask whether the octahedral distortions in the
high-T phase are static, as had been inferred from exper-
imental studies [11, 38]. We qualitatively analyzed JT
mode lifetimes by tracking the amplitude of the Q2 com-
onent of each octahedron over time. Figure 4c compares
he lifetimes at different temperatures for 20 randomly
selected octahedra. Each horizontal line in the plot rep-
resents the evolution of the Q2 component of one octa-
hedron in the last 100 fs from 10 ps runs at constant T.
While essentially static at 400 K, the lifetimes shorten
and the distortions start to fluctuate between different
directions at 500 K (red ¢+ blue in Fig. 4c). At 1,000 K,
he distortions are constantly swapping orientations with
a lifetime of ~ 40 fs [35], showing that distortions in the
high-T’ phase are highly dynamic. This behavior is remi-
niscent of JT-driven fluctuations in paraelectric BaTiOs,
in which asymmetric broadening of the Ti-O PDF peaks
at high temperatures is associated with anharmonicity
of Ti-off-centering dynamics [7, 39]. Similar interplay
of JT instabilities and strongly anharmonic lattice dy-
namics is found in the thermoelectrics PbTe and SnSe
[13, 40-42]. For PbTe, single-crystal inelastic neutron
scattering showed that the electronic instability causes
phonon anharmonicity resulting in dynamic dipoles that
give asymmetric PDF peaks with increasing temperature
[43]. The dynamic nature of the octahedral distortions in
LaMnO3 might be confirmed experimentally by the same

approach. For comparison with future studies, simulated
single-crystal diffuse scattering patterns from the config-
urations with 13,720 atoms are provided online [35].
Our key result has been to show that the conven-
tional JT distortion found in octahedral Mn?+ per-
ovskites is actually quenched in the orbital-disordered
phase of LaMnO3. The distortions that are present at
high temperatures are more varied and fluctuate on a
timescale that is similar to that of typical thermal mo-
tion. Hence the orbital arrangements in LaMnOsg are not
well described by a conventional order/disorder picture,
but instead involve a transition from static correlated
JT to dynamic JT-driven anharmonicity. Because CMR
emerges from this “orbital-disorder” phase on doping, our
analysis suggests that MLIP-driven MD simulations may
offer new insight into the microscopic nature of the CMR
phenomenon.
