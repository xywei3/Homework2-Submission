The Early Dark Energy (EDE) model has been proposed as a candidate mechanism to generate
cosmic birefringence through a Chern—-Simons coupling between a dynamical scalar field and the cos-
mic microwave background (CMB) photon. Such birefringence induces a nonzero cross-correlation
between the CMB E- and B-modes, providing a direct observational signature of parity violation.
Recent measurements of the 2B and TB power spectra, however, cannot yet unambiguously sep-
arate instrumental miscalibration (a) from a true cosmic-rotation angle (8). For this reason, we
perform a model-independent analysis in terms of the total effective rotation angle a + 8. We an-
alyze the latest EB and TB measurements from the SPIDER, Planck, and ACT experiments and
derive constraints on the Chern—-Simons coupling constant gMp,; and on the polarization rotation
angle a+ 3. We find that the coupling gMp; is not compatible with the SPIDER data, while it
provides reasonable fits to the Planck and ACT measurements. The fits for a+ 6 prefer a value
larger than zero: when combined, Planck+ACT yield a detection significance of approximately 7a.
We also find that ACT data alone do not provide sufficiently tight constraints on either gMp; or
a+, whereas the combination Planck+ACT improves the statistical consistency of ACT’s high-¢

results and leads to a bett

er PTE for those measurements.

I. INTRODUCTION

The discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) was a turning point in twentieth-

century physics, providing de
model as the standard cosmo.

cisive evidence for the hot Big Bang picture and establishing the ACDM
logical framework [1-5]. Although this model matches most observations

with remarkable accuracy, recent advances in precision cosmological observation have begun to expose
possible cracks in the paradigm [6]. Two anomalies in particular motivate the present work: the hints

of cosmic birefringence [7] an

d the Hubble constant discrepancy [8].

Cosmic birefringence refers to a rotation in the linear polarization of CMB photons as they travel

across cosmic distances [9-1

]. Analyses of Planck data suggest a non-zero rotation angle 3 with a

significance of about 3.60, corresponding to 8 = 0.342°+9-94. (68% C.L.) [12, 13]. The phenomenon

reveals itself through correla
conserving physics, Ey, and
antee that their auto-spectra

ions between the E and B polarization modes [14]. In standard parity-
Bom, have well-defined transformation rules under inversion, which guar-
remain unchanged while their cross-spectrum C/? flips sign. A non-zero

EB signal therefore points ¢

irectly to parity violation[15—28]. One compelling possibility is the ex-

istence of axion-like fields that couple to the electromagnetic tensor via an interaction 90F wF ne
[29, 30]. Such term would rotate polarization directions and generate EB correlations, while simul-
taneously leaking power from EF into B modes. At present, there are already many detectors that

have published their observa

ion for EB correlation. For example, such as POLARBEAR [31], ACT

[32], SPT [3], and SPIDER [5]. Upcoming polarization experiments, including the Simons Observa-
tory [33], AliCPT [34, 35], and LiteBIRD [36], are expected to probe these effects with much higher
sensitivity. In particular, LiteBIRD is forecast to detect not only a potential EB signal but also the
secondary BB component sourced by birefringence.

Parallelly, the Hubble tension is another pressing challenge faced in front of cosmology. This tension
is the mismatch between the Hubble constant inferred from early-Universe probes such as the CMB
and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and the values obtained from local measurements via the
distance ladder [8, 37]. The discrepancy at the 4—5o level and cannot be ignored nowadays [38-43].
Theoretical explanations have increasingly focused on modifications of the cosmic expansion history.
Among the few proposals able to alleviate the tension without creating fresh inconsistencies, Early
Dark Energy (EDE) scenarios have emerged as particularly promising. The EDE model posits the
presence of a transient dark energy component in the pre-recombination Universe, which alters the
sound horizon at last scattering and thereby shifts the inferred value of Hp. EDE has been extensively
tested against observational data [30, 44-52] with mixed results, some articles find that EDE does not
fit the cosmic birefringence observations [53], while others find that EDE is fully consistent with the
cosmic birefringence measurements as well as the Hy measurements from the SHOES experiment [54].
In this paper, we will investigate the cosmic birefringence effect resulting from the introduction of a
scalar-photon coupling within the Early Dark Energy (EDE) framework. Such a case creates a natural
link between the physics of the Hubble tension and that of Cosmic Birefringence. Our central question
is under multi CMB detectors at present whether the EB observation gives a consistent Chern-Simons
coupling constant? Are the miscalibration and rotation angle (a + 3) consistent with different EB
data? To address this, we selected SPIDER, Planck, and ACT data to constrain the constant gMp;
and model-independent angle a + 3, separately.

The structure of the paper is as follows. Section II reviews the EDE model we examine, outlines
the Boltzmann equations, and explains how they are altered by scalar-photon couplings. Section III
presents our results; the constraint results of gMp;, a+, and x? in different datasets will be discussed.
We summarize the results in Section IV.

II. COSMIC BIREFRINGENCE FROM THE EARLY DARK ENERGY MODEL

By introducing a Chern-Simons interaction, the Lagrangian describing the coupling between a pseu-
doscalar field and the electromagnetic field can be expressed as [30]

1

1 ith
ghee _ Ie ke : (1)

1 ‘
L=-5 (0,0) — V(4)
where ¢ represents a pseudoscalar field with a standard kinetic term and a potential V(¢). The constant
gMpi, with mass dimension —1, determines the strength of the Chern—Simons coupling. Here, F\,, is
the electromagnetic field strength tensor, and By denotes its dual counterpart.

Early dark energy (EDE) refers to a cosmological component that contributes a significant fraction
of the total energy density during the matter-radiation equality epoch. It has been proposed as a
potential solution to the Hubble tension by altering the pre-recombination expansion rate (44, 55-66].
The potential of the EDE in general is written as

V(9) = A*(1 — cos($/f))”, (2)

where n is a phenomenological parameter. In this work, we focus on the EDE model with n=3. In such
models, the energy density becomes relevant around, leading to a reduction of the comoving sound
horizon prior to photon decoupling. And the Eq.(2) provided a pseudoscalar potential and this EDE
can be the birefringence material in our Universe.

The presence of the Chern—-Simons term in the Lagrangian alters the propagation properties of
photons, leading to a modified dispersion relation [9-11]

~MkFS bs? KFS, é
a 2 Ee Eve 2 dt’ (3)
where the symbols + and — indicate the right- and left-handed circular polarization modes of the

photon, and w 4 represents the angular frequency associated with each helicity. We adopt a right-
handed coordinate system with the z-axis aligned along the photon’s direction of motion.

The rotation experienced by the plane of linear polarization is directly determined by the helicity-
dependent dispersion relation. In the regime where the photon frequency w is much larger than the
rate of change of the scalar field ¢, the WKB approximation can be applied. Within this framework,

the cumulative rotation angle of the polarization from an initial time t to the present time to is given
by

Bt) =~ 5 f° di, -w-) = $ foto) - 90). (4)

Under the conventions adopted here, a positive rotation angle, 6 > 0, corresponds to a clockwise
rotation of the linear polarization as seen on the sky, with the z-axis defined along the observer’s line
of sight. Our choice of polarization angle follows the same conventions as those in [7].

The evolution of the CMB polarization, including the effect of cosmic birefringence, can be described
by the modified Boltzmann equation:

. 67 .
+2A/p + igus2Ap = 7' [pasa F [Zasvouamt q)| +2i8'42Ap, (5)

where 7) denotes the conformal time, qg is the Fourier space wave number, and jz represents the cosine
of the angle between the photon propagation direction and the wave vector. The symbols +2Y/”
correspond to the spin-2 spherical harmonics, and II(7,q) defines the polarization source function.
The quantity 42Ap represents the Fourier transform of Q + iU, with Q and U being the standard
Stokes parameters describing the linear polarization of the radiation.

To express the polarization in terms of the spin-2 harmonics, +2Ap can be expanded as

soAp(n.a.1) = >i V/4n (Ql + DarAvi(n,g)e2¥P (W)- (6)
2

In general, the rotation angle 3 varies with conformal time, and the solution of the Boltzmann
equation incorporating 3(7) can be written as

1 a gal ve
+2Apu(no,) = —4y/ (ay Jo” dre" (mg) x Het ?1000, (7)
where x = q(no — 7) and je(2) is the spherical Bessel function of order ¢. This formulation explicitly
incorporates the time-dependent rotation of the polarization plane into the Fourier-space multipoles
of the polarization.

The angular power spectra of CMB polarization can be expressed as

CRY =a f ating P.(QAxs(@dvsld) (8)

where P,(q) denotes the primordial scalar curvature power spectrum, and X,Y indicate the E or B
polarization modes. The multipole coefficients Ag (q) and Ag.(q) can be directly obtained from
Eq. 7 through the relation

Arig) =iAB(q) = —42Ap. (10,4) - (9)

Further discussions on the Boltzmann treatment of TB and EB correlations can be found in Refs. [67,
68]. In the special case where the rotation angle 8 is constant, the observed E and B mode fluctuations
can be expressed as

Aget iABye = et2i8 (Are bs iApw) § (10)

where Age and Ape represent the fluctuations in the absence of Cosmic Birefringence. In this
framework, any non-zero EB and TB correlations reflect parity-violating effects [14].

CFF = cos*(28)CF® + sin?(28)CP®, (11)
CP® = cos?(28)CP® + sin?(28)CF*, (12)
CPP = 4 sin(43) (CPY - CP?) (13)
CT® = sin(28)C7, (14)

where Cp represents the polarization spectra in the absence of any Cosmic Birefringence. When 3
is set to zero, the TE, EE and BB spectra reduce to their standard values without photon-scalar
interactions, and the EB, T’'B cross spectrum vanishes. In cases where the BB spectrum is much
smaller than EE, the EB correlation can be approximated as CP? ~ tan(28)CP”. This formulation
clearly illustrates how a constant birefringence angle mixes the F and B modes and induces a nonzero
EB and TB correlation.

In general, the potential @ varies over time from the dynamical evolution of the scalar. In such
cases, an analytical treatment of the rotation angle 3 and the Boltzmann equations must be integrated
numerically. To accomplish this, we employ the publicly available CLASS_EDE extension [69] of the
CLASS code [70, 71] to compute the polarization power spectra EE, BB, TE, TB and EB We will
analysis concentrate on the EDE with different datasets from SPIDER, Planck, and ACT.

Ill. FITTING COSMIC BIREFRINGENCE WITH DIFFERENT CMB DATASETS

In this Section, we use EB and TB observation data from SPIDER, Planck, and ACT experiments
o fit the Chern-Simons coupling constant parameter g based on the EDE model. Meanwhile, we
also constrain the model-independent angle a + {, which is the addition of miscalibration and cosmic
irefringence rotation angle. SPIDER is a balloon-borne CMB instrument designed primarily to mea-
sure the polarization of the CMB on degree angular scales, with Galactic synchrotron emission being
negligible within its observational frequency bands. SPIDER provides observations at very low multi-
ole moments (¢ < 250), and currently offers 9 EB data points. We use its XFaster Combined data
results[5]. Meanwhile, we also considered the Planck observation. Planck is one of the most important
CMB detections, providing precise TT, TE, and FE polarization. We employ the EB data analyzed
y Eskilt et al. [13], which consists of 72 data points covering the multipole range of ¢ between 50 and
500. The third kind of EB observation we considered in this paper is the Atacama Cosmology Tele-
scope(ACT). ACT is a new-generation ground-based CMB experiment, which has garnered significant
attention for its performance in high-f measurements. We use the latest released EB data{32], which
includes 38 data points covering the multipole range from 600 to 3400. These high-! TB data will be
discussed for its constraints on the Chern-Simons coupling constant parameter gMp;.

We adopt the values of other parameters in the EDE model based on the best-fit results from the
Base and Base+SHOES datasets presented in Eskilt et al[53]. The Base dataset includes the Planck
power spectra of temperature and polarization [72], and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey
(BOSS) Data Release 12 [73]. For the Base+SHOES dataset, the local SHOES measurement of Ho is
also considered [37] based on Planck data. The 9 basic EDE model parameters’ numerical results are
summarized in Table I. In addition, we also considered testing gMp; with the best-fit parameters from
the constraints with Base+SHOES plus Planck EB and Lensing data, as we show in the previous
work([54]. We give this group of data a short name as BSL, and show the result in Table I. Cosmic
birefringence is treated as a secondary effect under these constrained parameter configurations.

We will use the aforementioned constraint results to compute the best-fit value of gMp; and the
corresponding y? statistic. The x? formula is defined as follows:

n

2 yr i= 01) 5
a > a ; (15)
where T;, is the theoretical prediction, and O; (0;) is the observational value of the CMB power spectra,
respectively.

Given the varying numbers of observational data points across SPIDER, Planck, and ACT datasets,
we will use the probability to exceed (PTE) to evaluate the quality of the fit to the data. The PTE
value represents the probability of finding a x? value greater than the one obtained, given the number
of degrees of freedom. A small PTE means that the y? is too high for the degrees of freedom and

is indicative of a poor quality fit. For reference, for large degrees of freedom, the x? distribution
approaches a normal distribution and a PTE smaller than 0.32 corresponds to a > 1 —o tension with
the data. On the other hand, a value of PTE that is very close to 1, such as 0.99, indicate overfitting.
The number of degrees of freedom, v, is given by, v = N —k, where N is the number of observational
data points, and k is the number of fitted parameters. In this fit, only gp, and a+ 3 is constrained
separately, so the number of parameters is k = 1.

We now incorporate the EB data from SPIDER to constrain the best-fit value of the Chern-Simons
coupling constant gMp; and compute the corresponding x”. Figure 1 shows the CMB Df® spectra

In the combined data analysis, we cut the Planck data to exclude overlaps with SPIDER or ACT
to avoid double-counting. We use the lower cut min=250 and the upper cut ¢mar=600 for the Planck
data, when combining it with SPIDER and ACT data respectively. We repeated all our analyses with-
out applying any data cuts and found that it does not significantly change the results and conclusions.
For consistency, we use the Planck data cuts throughout the article whenever analyzing combinations
of datasets. Across all data combinations, we find that a + 6 remains positive, and we calculated
the confidence of it does not return to zero. In SPIDER-EB, Planck-EB, ACT-EB, and ACT-TB
datasets, the confidence of larger than zero is 1.220, 9.670, 4.750, and 1.730, respectively. For the
combined dataset, the confidence of a + 6 > 0 in SPIDER+Planck, SPIDER+ACT, Planck+ACT,
SPIDER+Planck+ACT are 9.670, 6.30, 7.00, and 7.30, respectively. This indicates that the ob-
served birefringence signal cannot be fully attributed to the Planck instrumental miscalibration angle
a, suggesting a genuine cosmological origin. The corresponding y?, PTE, and posterior probability
density are shown in Table III and Figure 4. We note that the constraint on a + £ is almost identica
etween the Planck+ACT and SPIDER+Planck+ACT data combinations, which suggests that mos
of the constraining power comes from Planck and ACT, and SPIDER contributes very little towards
he constraints.

Fig. 5 provides a summary and comparative overview of the results above. The theoretical best-
fit curves from SPIDER and Planck data are extrapolated to high multipoles for the purpose o
comparison. Left-hand side figure (a) can be clearly seen that the best-fit values from SPIDER EB ai

combined constraints using all three groups of data, represented by a dashed gray line. The constraint
numbers are given in the Table IV. Figure (b) on the right-hand side shows the combined results o
he model-independent angle a + £ in different datasets. The corresponding values are shown in Table

To evaluate whether pairwise combinations of datasets improve the constraints, we also tested several

under Base+SHOES, gM, = 0.063 with x? = 172.28. And under BSL, gM,; = —0.0005 and x? =
88.69. The corresponding PTE values are smaller than 10~!, showing that gMp, does not provide
a good enough fit to these three data combinations. Future studies will require both higher-precision
measurements and a greater volume of low-multipole (low-l) data to achieve more robust constraints.
Comparing gMp; and PTE result by only using ACT-£B data in Table II with Planck+ACT result in
Table IV, we can find the fitting result by Planck+ACT has higher confidence than use ACT-EB only,
that shows high-/ observation results need to combine with Planck to get better analyze in the cosmic
birefringence. The result of a + § are shown in Table III and Fig. 6 (b). Notably, the Planck+ACT
combination dataset PTE for a+ ( is 0.490, and PTE for gMp, is 1.72 x 10-%, 2.20 x 10-4, and 0.0532
in Base, Base+SHOES, and BSL datasets, respectively. These results are significantly more robust than
other combined datasets, demonstrating that the Planck+ACT combination will be a more reliable

Iv. SUMMARY

In this paper, we analyze the Cosmic Birefringence from the Early Dark Energy interacting with
photons in Chern-Simons coupling then constraints on the Chern-Simons coupling constant gMp;
and the model-independent angle a + 3 by using the SPIDER, Planck, and ACT observations. We
systematically evaluate their fitting performance through both x? and PTE statistics. For individual
datasets, Planck exhibits a larger PTE and higher confidence levels, both in measuring gMp; and a+.
Regarding a+, except for SPIDER and ACT-TB which currently have excessively large uncertainties,
all other datasets and combined results indicate that a+ 6 is greater than zero within 4.750 confidence
level. Although ACT-EB and ACT-TB show significantly different results for gMp;, their central
values for a + @ are identical. Additionally, the rotation angle inferred independently from Planck

and ACT differ by > 30, which hints that a polarisation miscalibration angle may be preferred over
early dark energy, by the ACT data. Among the pairwise combined datasets, the Planck+ACT(EB)
combination demonstrates significantly higher PTE and Posterior Probability Density, making it a
more promising dataset combination for future exploration. Including the SPIDER dataset does not
significantly impact the constraints, indicating that the contribution of SPIDER to the constraining
power is minor. We find that for the ACT experiment, which primarily probes the high-¢ region, it is
necessary to combine it with the relatively lower-¢ measurements from Planck in order to obtain results
with higher confidence. This joint analysis yields a better PTE than using ACT-EB data alone.

We anticipate that future observations with enhanced precision, such as those from LiteBIRD and
AliCPT, will provide more robust and conclusive results, particularly when focusing on their combined
results with Planck and ACT, which may yield higher confidence levels.

Appendix

In this appendix, we present the ? values and the best-fit constraints on the coupling constant
gape (defined as gMp; in the EDE model). The results obtained from the SPIDER, Planck, ACT, and
SPIDER+Planck+ACT data sets are shown in Fig. 7. The first, second, and third columns correspond
to cosmological parameters derived from the Base, Base+SHOES, and BSL datasets, respectively.
Fig. 8 shows the constraints on gepm and the corresponding y” values obtained from the combined
data of SPIDER+Planck, SPIDER+ACT, and Planck+ACT. Similarly, the first, second, and third
columns correspond to cosmological parameters obtained from the Base, Base+SHOES, and BSL cases,
respectively.
