Abstract

We present a solvable one-dimensional spin-1/2 model on the diamond chain featur-
ing three-spin interactions, which displays both, mobile excitations driving a second-
order phase transition between an ordered and a Z2-symmetry broken phase, as well as
non-trivial fully immobile excitations. The model is motivated by the physics of fracton
excitations, which only possess mobility in a reduced dimension compared to the full
model. We provide an exact mapping of this model to an arbitrary number of indepen-
dent transverse-field Ising chain segments with open boundary conditions. The number
and lengths of these segments correspond directly to the number of immobile excita-
tions and their respective distances from one another. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that multiple immobile excitations exhibit Casimir-like forces between them, resulting
in a non-trivial spectrum.

1 Introduction

A usual assumption in the field of quantum many-body physics, when dealing with low-energy
quasi-particle excitations is that they inherit their degrees of freedom from the lattice they are
defined on. A class of excitations which in recent years gained a lot of interest are fractons
and sub-dimensional particles, which defy the above notion. Such excitations are only mobile
within a subsystem manifold that has a dimension smaller than that of the lattice. The notion
fracton was coined in the context of exactly solvable topologically ordered quantum spin sys-
tems [1,2], some of which are candidates for stable quantum memory [3]. Associated fracton
phases are typically classified into two categories: Type-I fracton phases, such as in the X-Cube
model [2] and type-II fracton phases, such as in Haah’s Code [3]. Both types of fracton phases
are defined on three-dimensional lattices, are translation-invariant, possess an energy gap,
exhibit subextensive ground-state degeneracy, display long-range entanglement in the ground
state, and feature immobile topological point-like excitations known as fractons, which give
these systems their name. The characteristic immobility of the fractons is robust against any
local disturbances. For type-I fracton phases, fractons can still form composite excitations that
can move in one (lineons), two (planons), or three dimensions. In contrast, such composite
mobile excitations are not possible in type-II fracton phases. Since their initial introduction,
the study of their dynamical properties has become a compelling field of research in its own
right. Systems with fractons can, for example, exhibit intriguing hydrodynamic universality
classes [4] and may violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis [5,6]. A comprehensive
review of fractons can be found in Refs. [7-9]. The concept of fractons can be transferred to
non-topological two-dimensional systems. Often, the non-trivial kinetic properties of fracton
excitations arrive from the presence of subsystem symmetries [10-14]. Interestingly, recent
| SciPost Physics Core | Physics Core Submission

findings have established connections between the topologically ordered toric code and such
fracton excitations [15-17].

In this work we investigate an integrable one-dimensional spin-1/2 model of three-spin
interactions on the diamond chain. Besides regular mobile excitations, which can move along
the one-dimensional extent of the system, this model features fully immobile excitations local-
ized on a given site. Although these types of immobile excitations do not exhibit the typical
characteristics of fracton excitations, such as gaining an additional degree of mobility when
present in multiples, these excitations remain immobile even when an arbitrary number of
them are excited because they are protected by exact quantum numbers. They are therefore
an exciting zero-dimensional counterpart of fracton excitations in higher dimensions with re-
spect to their reduced dimensionality.

A more accurate interpretation of the model and its immobile excitations actually arises
from viewing it as a one-dimensional cut-out of a higher-dimensional model with fracton ex-
citations. Indeed, one can imagine a higher-dimensional model with at least one fracton exci-
tation, whose mobility is restricted (alone or in pairs) to a one-dimensional subsystem due to
subsystem symmetries. If we know where to cut out a slice of this model that is orthogonal to
the subsystem in which the fractional excitation was allowed to move, we are left with a system
in which these excitations, which previously had a single degree of mobility, now lack any di-
rection in which to move and consequently become immobile. Similarly, the one-dimensional
subsystem symmetry will transition to a zero-dimensional local symmetry that precisely con-
serves the immobile excitations. Such a cut-out procedure is of course only possible if the
interactions are sufficiently local and fit on the lower-dimensional cutout system.

Interestingly, an extensive number of local symmetries allows us to provide an exact map-
ping of our model to an arbitrary number of independent transverse-field Ising chain segments
with open boundary conditions. The number and lengths of these segments correspond di-
rectly to the number of immobile excitations and their respective distances from one another.
While fully localized, multiple immobile excitations exhibit Casimir-like forces between them,
resulting in a non-trivial spectrum.

The article is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we introduce the model including its sym-
metries, the immobile excitations, and the exact duality mapping in terms of pseudo-spin
transverse-field Ising chains. The analytic solution of the low-energy properties is given in
Sec. 3. In the subsequent Sec. 4 we discuss the quantum phase diagram of the model and we
conclude in Sec. 5.

2 Model

In this section we define the model studied in this work, discuss its symmetries and the re-
sulting mappings to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model in its different symmetry
sectors.

We consider a quasi-one-dimensional diamond chain with linear length L which is built by
alternating between single sites and dimers of spin-1/2 particles as illustrated in Fig. 1. The
Hamiltonian is defined by three-spin interactions between the two spins of a dimer and a
neighbouring single site. We further include a transverse field in z—direction acting on every
spin. In appendix B we discuss the results obtain by introducing magnetic fields with differing
strengths on the single and dimer sites.

The three-site unit cell of the diamond chain is given by the two spins A and B of a dimer and
the neighbouring spin C. The number of unit cells in a finite version of this model is thus equal
to the number of dimer sites, which we will call Ng and the linear length L is given by 2Nq.
Looking at a finite periodic chain with Ny dimers, the full Hamiltonian is given by

with a three-spin coupling strength J and a magnetic field strength h. Sums are taken over unit
cells with periodic boundary conditions. The signs of J and h are taken to be positive. These
signs are irrelevant for our purposes as flipping all spins in z(x)-direction using the operator

and similar for U,.

2.1 Symmetries

In order to discuss in Subsec. 2.4 the mapping to the transfers field Ising model and our models
phases in the limiting cases we summaries its symmetries. This model has a significant number
of subsystem symmetries - namely one for each dimer i. As the full system is one-dimensional,
these local subsystems are zero-dimensional. These symmetries are given by

Zz

Si= OF iB (3)

with eigenvalue s; € {+1}. In addition to these local symmetries there is a global symmetry
similar to a total spin-flip symmetry. This symmetry flips one spin of every dimer and every
spin between dimers

Na
Ship = I] Fi aPic (4)
i=l

with eigenvalue sq; € {+1}. All other symmetry involving spin-flips can be written as a product
of these two types of symmetries.

2.2 Limiting cases

The Hamiltonian (1) in the thermodynamic limit displays an ordered phase in the limit h > J
and a Z, symmetry-broken phase in the limit J > h. The Z2 symmetry is given by Sip. For
h = 0, the degeneracy of the ground state is 2%«+! corresponding to the Ny local symmetries
S; and the global symmetry Sq). In the range h/J < 1 second-order perturbation theory leads
to an energy splitting between the two ground states

where |) denotes the product state with all spins pointing in positive x-direction and all
remaining previous ground states, leading to the Z? symmetric phase (see Appendix C for the
calculation).

The quantum phase transition is driven by the mobile modes of the model, which in the
limit h > J are adiabatically connected to a single spin-flip on a single site C in a unit cell.
Note that the quantum phase transition has to be driven by mobile excitations as the immobile
excitations are fully local and can thus not lead to symmetry breaking as of Elitzur’s theorem
[18].

2.3 Immobile excitations

Taking a look at the low-energy excitations for perturbatively small J we notice that a spin-flip
between two dimers can travel freely to any other single site on the diamond chain just by ap-
plying the three-spin interactions accordingly, while a single spin-flip on a dimer cannot move
to another dimer by any number of finitely many applications of the three-spin interactions
and is thus immobile in any finite order in perturbative theory.

In this work we will calculate the energy of this immobile excitation analytically in the
parameter range, where it is adiabatically connected to a single spin-flip on a dimer. To do
so we have to identify the appropriate symmetry sectors. A single immobile excitation lives
in the symmetry sector where all except one of the local subsystem symmetries S; have the
eigenvalue s; = +1, while the remaining one has the eigenvalue —1. The global symmetry has
an eigenvalue of Sfip = +1 as does the ground-state sector of the h > J limit. The ground-state
energy in this sector will be equal to the ground-state energy in the sector without the immobile
excitation plus its excitation energy. The symmetry sector without immobile mode is given by
setting the eigenvalues of all symmetries to +1. We will therefore calculate the ground-state
energies of the model in both of these sectors for finite Ng, calculate their difference and look
at the limit Ng > ©° in order to calculate its energy in the thermodynamic limit. In order to
perform these calculations we introduce duality mappings depending on the chosen symmetry
sector.

2.4 Bijective mappings to transverse-field Ising models

We introduce a duality mapping from the sites of our model to the three spin bonds depicted
in Fig. 1 by mapping the three-spin interactions to pseudo-spins 1/2

oF, CFA ie > Tip

Given a periodic chain with Ny dimers its Hilbert space is 2°“-dimensional, while the Hilbert
space of the pseudo-spins is only 27%¢-dimensional. If we fix all Nq subsystem symmetries S;
we end up in a 22%a-dimensional Hilbert space as well and can thus find a bijection between

these two spaces. The mapping (6) implies

Cin — TE BTi+LA
oF pn — eigenvalue(S;)t; BULA (7)
Fic > TiaTipe

Thus all terms are mapped to terms appearing in the transverse-field Ising model, with a two
atomic unit cell. This mapping is still somewhat misleading, as the limit J — 0 would now
imply that the model before the mapping has one ground state, while after the mapping it
would have two. This problem can be resolved by realising, that the mapping provided so

far is not injective, as it would map the state |@) and Sq;, |®) to the same state in the Hilbert
space of pseudo-spins. We can now further restrict us to the original Hilbert space in a given
symmetry sector of Spip- The mapping between the 2?Na-!_dimensional Hilbert space and
its image of the same dimension in the twice as large Hilbert space of pseudo-spins is then
bijective, linear, and thus conserves the eigenvalues. We therefore have to further adapt the
above mapping by replacing ON,C > eigenvalue(Spip)T x, ATNB depending of the symmetry
sector of Spip.

Notice that the difference between the mapped models in the two symmetry sectors with
all local symmetry eigenvalues s; equal to +1 and all local symmetry eigenvalues s; equal to +1
except one is the difference between an open and periodic model after mapping. This follows
from the fact that the term Oi AtOrg is mapped to (1 +eigenvalue(S;))t 7,744; which is just
zero, if eigenvalue(S;) = —1, thus cutting the periodic chain into an open chain. Similarly, the
presence of multiple immobile excitations correspond to setting multiple local symmetries S;
to eigenvalue s; = —1, cutting the transverse-field Ising chain into several disconnected pieces.
The mapped Hamiltonian can then be written in terms of pseudo-spins as

3 Analytic solution of the low-energy spectrum

In this section we derive an analytic expression for the energy of the immobile excitations dis-
cussed. To achieve this, we will calculate the ground-state energy on a finite chain of Hamil-
tonian (1) in the two relevant symmetry sectors discussed above, take the difference and then
take the thermodynamic limit by increasing the system size to infinite.

The ground-state of the ordered phase is contained in the symmetry sector where all sym-
metries have eigenvalue +1. In this symmetry sector the model maps to the pseudo-spin
transverse-field Ising chain with alternating Ising coupling strengths and periodic boundary
conditions. Its diagonalisation is well known and we will just summarize it shortly in Sub-
sec. 3.1,

The immobile excitation is contained in the symmetry sector where all symmetries have
eigenvalue +1 except one. In this symmetry sector the model maps to a pseudo-spin transverse-
field Ising chain with open boundary conditions. Its approximate but sufficient solution on a
finite chain requires more attention and is discussed in detail in Subsec. 3.2.

with Ng+1 = 1. Its diagonalisation can be performed analytically by applying a Jordan-Wigner
transformation, Fourier transformation, and Bogoliubov transformation in succession.

The Jordan-Wigner transformation to fermions is performed by ordering the pseudo-spins in
the order (1,A) > (1,B) > (2,A) — (2,B) —... so that one has

Note that Sq;, maps to eit Ds (rat ny), If we are in the symmetry sector with Sg, = +1, we
do not get a negative sign for the Ising interaction where we roll over with the indices. This
also shows that physical excitations are those with an even number of fermionic excitations
(see also Subsec. 2.4 ).

where €/;(k) are the positive eigenvalues of M. These are given by

€9/1(k) = | J24 one aa \ a +(5+4+4cos(k))(Jh)2 . (19)

Here €,(k) corresponds to a single spin-flip excitation moving along the single sites and €)(k)
corresponds to two spin-flips on a dimer moving along the dimer sites. As further discussed
in Sec. 4 the gap €,(k) of single spin-flip excitations closes at (J /h), = /2 corresponding to a
second-order phases transition as mention in Subsec. 2.2.

Finally, the ground-state energy is given by

Note that we did not check, that the ground-state defined by the condition 7;,1/2|0) = 0 for
all crystal momenta k is in fact in the symmetry sector with an even number of fermions as we
assumed. For our purposes in this paper, in particular determining the energy of the immobile
excitations in the ordered phase, we can argue that the ground-state lies in the symmetry sector
with an even number of fermions as does the ground-state in both limiting cases h/J — 0 and
h/J — oo. One further finds that in the thermodynamic limit the difference between the
ground-state energy of the two different sectors vanishes and thus plays no role in the energy
differences calculated later.

3.2 Solution of the open case

Next we consider the mapped model in the symmetry sector with $; = —1, which according
to Eq. (8) is given by

In the open-chain case the dual pseudo-spin model is the same for Sai, = +1 and therefore

also the ground-state energy is the same in both symmetry sectors.
To diagonalize the pseudo-spin model in this case we perform a real space Bogoliubov trans-
formation following [19]. First, we introduce the vector

and write the Hamiltonian in the form

Next we introduce new fermionic operators given by
Na
n= Sigiti + mj (w')" . (26)

where g;;,mj; are again two by two matrices. We then write the Hamiltonian in the form

H=Dinjtin; + By - (27)
J

Because H turns into —H under particles-hole exchange c’ <> c, the spectrum of H is sym-
metric around zero and the ground-state energy EQ is just given by — >> i 3Tr (I;). We now
calculate the commutator [H, nj] using this new form which yields

([H,nj]=—Tjnj;- (28)

Next we insert the definition of 7; into both sides of this equation to obtain the coupled equa-
tions

TX =Y2(A+B)

TY =X2(A—B), (29)

where X = g +mand Y = g—m. The quantities without indices are the matrices with two-
by-two matrices as elements. As these two equations determine each other, we can calculate
Y via

Y2(A+B)2(A—B)=I7Y. (30)
This is just the eigenvalue equation written in terms of a matrix (here Y) containing the eigen-

vectors. We will thus determine the eigenvalues of (A+ B)(A—B) to obtain the eigenvalues of
the initial Hamiltonian. Writing out this matrix we obtain

Je pn Jh 0 0 (en) 0

This is almost a tridiagonal matrix with alternating entries on the three diagonals with an
exception in the last entry: Here one has J? instead of J? + 4h?. The size of this matrix is 2Nq
by 2N,. We define the determinant of this 2N, by 2N, matrix minus A? as

Py, = det ((A+ B)(A—B)an,x2ny — A? Lanyx2ny) + (32)

The analogous determinant for a (2N4— 1) by (2Nqg— 1) matrix, which is given by the above
matrix with the first row and column removed, thus starting with the entry J? + 4h? in the top
left, will be called Qy,. By repeated Laplace expansion in its first row and column, we find the
recursion relations

Py, = J? +h? —27)Qny, — UA)? Pry

we rewrite this equation as

det(M) =4(Jh)* ,

where «@j/2 are the eigenvalues of M. We find the eigenvalues via the equation Py, = 0. To
solve this equation we consider two different cases. First, we look at the case |w,| 4 |wo|
where we find

0 = max(,, w) + 4h? (A? —h?) (37)

in the limit Ny — oo. This equation has two roots. A single root at A = 0 and a quadratic root
at A= VJ2+h2. Second, we consider the case |w | = ||. This is only possible, if both roots
are complex and we can set

01/2 = Joy ale*!? =2(Jhyer? - (38)

The eigenvalue equation can then be rewritten as

+ 2(fy + (54 acoso) (*) (39)

in terms of the angle ¢. To first order, we can approximate the function on the left in the
thermodynamic limit as a sequence of vertical lines at the roots of sin((Nq + 1)@). Exceptions
are the first positive root and the last root before ¢ = 7, which are vertical lines that do not
extend infinitely but start (end) at +1 (—1).

Let us focus on the case |h| > wl | where the gap closes. Here, the negative mode (negative

This turns out to be insufficient and we will need the corrections to these roots in order
1/(Nqg + 1), which will contribute an additional finite term in the energy of the immobile
excitation in the thermodynamic limit. To do so, we define the roots ¢,, = mm/(Ng +1) and
make the ansatz

4 Phase transition and excitation spectra

The low-energy spectrum contains three distinct modes. Two mobile modes, which in the limit
of large fields h >> J are adiabatically connected to a single spin-flip located on a single site
or two spin-flips on a dimer, respectively. The gap of the single spin-flip excitation closes at
J/h = J/2 resulting in a second-order phase transition. Further, one immobile mode ener-

Fig. 2). Both, the excitation gap of the low-lying mobile mode and the immobile mode de-
crease in energy when approaching the quantum critical point as shown in Fig. 3. As already

stressed above, the immobile modes are protected by the local symmetries and correspond to
eigenvalues s; = —1 (see Subsec. 2.1). A closing of the gap between the energy of such immo-
bile modes and the ground-state would imply a phase with a broken local symmetry, which is
forbidden by Elitzur’s theorem [18]. Our findings for Eq. (1) and variants of it discussed in
Appendix B are therefore fully consistent in this respect. Consequently, to detect a gap closing
of a mode exhibiting dimensional reduction, one has to investigate systems in higher spatial
dimensions.

yields an interpretation of our immobile modes as walls between different Ising chain seg-
ments. So far we looked at a single immobile mode. Considering two immobile excitations,

| SciPost Physics Core | Physics Core Submission

the energy of a given configuration depends on the distance between these two immobile
modes or the distance of the two walls in the dual pseudo-spin formulation. Following the
previous derivation, we find that the energy of such a two-mode configuration is given as the
difference between the ground-state energy of the periodic transverse field Ising model with
Ng dimers and the sum of the ground-state energies of two open transverse-field Ising chain
segments with d and Ny—d dimers, respectively. Taking this difference and considering the
thermodynamic limit, we find a monotonically decreasing dependence of the energy on the
distance d between them. In this wall picture one might interpret this as a force similar to a
Casimir force between conducting plates, while in the original model the interpretation would
be an attractive interaction induced via the three-spin interaction. The force is defined as the
energy of two immobile modes at a distance d minus the energy of these two modes at a
distance d—1. These forces are given in the thermodynamic limit by the expression

where EP"(d) is the ground-state energy of the transverse-field Ising chain with open bound-

ary conditions (43) with d dimers. A derivation is given in Appendix A. The ground-state
energies of the finite open chain segments are calculated numerically and the resulting forces
are illustrated in Fig. 4. One notices the dependence on the parameter J/h. While smaller
J/h leads to stronger forces at small distances that quickly decay, larger values lead to smaller
forces with slower decay.

5 Conclusions

In this work we introduced a quantum spin model with three-spin interactions on a diamond
chain. The model is analytically solvable due to the existence of an extensive number of local

13
| SciPost Physics Core | Physics Core Submission

symmetries allowing an exact duality mapping to pseudo-spins 1/2 transverse-field Ising chain
segments. The ground-state phase diagram displays a second-order phase transition in the 2D
Ising universality class which is driven by mobile excitations of the system. Interestingly, fully
immobile excitations exist which are protected by the local symmetries. In the dual language
these immobile excitations correspond to vacancies so that each immobile excitations cuts
the dual transverse-field Ising chain. Further, we have obtained analytic expressions for the
attractive Casimir-like force between two immobile excitations.

We find particular interesting the exact fragmentation in terms of open chain segments
in the dual formulation for an arbitrary number of immobile excitations. This paves the way
towards the investigation of finite density and temperature properties by building on the an-
alytic findings derived in this work. In addition, the derived duality links dilution disorder in
the transverse field Ising chain with disorder in the placement of immobile excitations in the
original model, which is an interesting topic for future investigations.

In the future we plan to investigate extensions of our model to higher dimensions. Indeed,
in two dimensions one obtains a model of three-spin interactions on the 2D pyrochlore lattice
which is isospectral to the XY toric code (XYTC) in a transverse magnetic field [15]. The XYTC
features fractonic excitations which are protected by subsystem symmetries and it is therefore
interesting to understand their fate upon an increasing external magnetic field.

A Force between two immobile excitations

In order to calculate the force between two (or more) immobile excitations we calculate the
energy of a configuration of two immobile modes the same way we did before by subtract-
ing the ground-state energy of the sector without immobile excitations from the ground-state
energy of the sector with two modes at a distance d from each other. In the sector with two
immobile excitations the dual pseudo-spin model (see 2.3) becomes an open transverse-field
Ising chain segment with d dimers and another open chain segment with N —d dimers. Thus,
the energy of the configuration is given by

E,(d) = Jim [ Bg? — d) + Bo? ™(d) — BEN) . (49)

We define the force between two immobile excitations as the difference of the energies of a
configuration with two immobile excitations at a distance d and one with distance d—1

we use the following identity for an analytic function f on the interval (0, 1)

B_ Alternating magnetic field strengths

In this part we generalize our model to different magnetic fields h, and hy on the single and
on the dimer sites. We call the magnetic field on the single sites h, = h and the magnetic
field on the dimers hy = rh with the ratio r of these magnetic fields. The calculations are
mostly analogous to the main body of the article. Here we will summarize and expand on
other aspects not mentioned previously.

B.1_ Periodic boundary conditions

Here the calculations are fully analogous we just replace the functions f, and f_ with

We can again calculate the stationary modes via
max( , W) +4r7h? (a? —h?) =0 58)

This has again the roots at A = 0 and a quadratic root at A = VJ? + h2 but this root only exists
for |r| > 1/2. Next we again consider the case where |c | = |w.| and we write

4/9 = 2\r|J7h7e*# , 59)

to obtain the analogous equation
sin((Ng+1)¢)
sin(Nad)

We analyse the right-hand side for ¢ = 0 and ¢ = 7 to see, if the modes closest to these values
are included. We assume |r| > 1/2. We find that the positive branch (+ at the +) is always
smaller than —1 and thus always misses both crossings. The negative branch again always
misses the crossing at ¢ = 7 and crosses at ¢ = O for

hy? 1

where we further assumed r to be positive. This is again the point of the quantum phase
transition where the mobile mode condenses.

(60)

B.3 The case r < 1/2

Here we remove the double root at VJ2+h2. We gain an addend of €,() + €,(7) by now
including the last root of Eq. 39 but this addend is again removed due to the changed start
and end values of the function

¢,(0) =—2

c(7) =0

c2(0) = 0 (62)
Co(t) =0.

So in summary for r > 0 we can write

C Second-order degenerate perturbation theory

We discuss the second-order perturbative corrections in h/J to the ground-state sector at h = 0.
We look at a system with Ny dimers and periodic coupling. The ground-state manifold can be
constructed by providing the eigenvalues {s;};<y, (s; € {—1,+1}) for the Ng local symmetries
S; and the global symmetry Sq;,._ We may construct these states by applying the operators
(1 +5s,S;) to the in x-direction polarised state |) depending on the sign of the eigenvalue of
the symmetry S;. We can proceed equivalently with the global symmetry Spip to obtain a basis
of the 2%«*! dimensional ground-state vector space

We split our Hamiltonian 1 into an unperturbed part Hp, which contains the three spin
interactions and a perturbation equal to the magnetic field V = Ayes > Fe{AB,c} %, fe Us-
ing Takahashi perturbation theory [20] we can determine the effective Hamiltonian in the
degenerate ground-space Hilbert-space up to second order via

where Pp is the projection operator onto the degenerate ground-state Hilbert-space. We
note that acting with a single o” operator on any of the ground-states 64 will flip the eigen-
value of the two three-spin interactions touched by the site the o* operator acts on and thus
this state will no longer be in the degenerate ground-state Hilbert-space. The first order con-
tribution therefore is identical to zero. The second order contribution contains non-vanishing
contributions. Considering a dimer and its neighbouring single site we find five ways to subse-
quently arrange and apply two o* operators while staying inside the degenerate ground-state
Hilbert-space. There are three ways to apply the o” operators on the same site and two ways
to place them on the Dimer (the first on the upper site and the second on the lower site and
vice versa). The operator noah will always be equal to —71 in this situation, thus considering

the five ways to arrange the o* operators we find
