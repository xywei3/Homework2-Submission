ABSTRACT:

In the quest of green energy, Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) have drawn considerable
attention for chemical-to-electric energy conversion. Electrolyte material with high oxygen
ionic conductivity is essential for an efficient SOFC operation. However, materials with
higher oxygen ionic conduction are rear in nature. Selective chemical substitution is an
effective route to enhance ionic conductivity of an existing material. In the present paper, we
report an enhancement of ionic conductivity in Cu2P2-xV,O7 by vanadium substitution. The
electrical (de and ac conductivity, diffusivity, hopping rate, electric modulus and dielectric
properties) and crystal structural properties of Cu2P2xVxO7 (x = 0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1) are
investigated by impedance spectroscopy and neutron diffraction, respectively. X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study confirms the presence of Cu**, P>tand V>* mono-
valence states. The de conductivity results reveal a two orders of magnitude enhancement of
ionic conductivity from ~3.81x10° S cm’! for x =0 to ~2.08x10° S cm’! for x =1 at 993 K,
revealing a possible application in SOFCs. DC transport number studies reveal that the total
conductivity is dominated by ionic conduction (> 95%). In addition, the diffusivity and
hopping rate of oxide ions increase with increasing x. Besides, ac conductivity, electric
modulus and dielectric properties have been investigated to illustrate the microscopic
conduction mechanism. The derived results suggest that the mechanism for ionic conduction
is the correlated barrier hopping (CBH) process. The soft-bond valence sum (BVS) analysis
of the neutron diffraction patterns reveals the three-dimensional (3D) oxide ion conduction
pathways within the crystal structure. The crystal structural study reveals an increase in unit
cell volume, polyhedra volume and polyhedral distortion with increasing x, which lead to an
enhancement of the ionic conduction. The present study provides a pathway to enhance the
ionic conductivity, as well as understanding of microscopic conduction mechanism, ionic
conduction pathways and the role of crystal structure on the ionic conduction.

1. INTRODUCTION

Green energy sources are naturally replenished, making them a sustainable choice for long-term energy
needs. In the thrust of green energy, the Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC)! are attracted a considerable
attraction in recent years due to their several salient features including high efficiency, low emissions
(minimal production of pollutants), silent-operation (no noise), long-lasting and simplicity. Efficiency
of the SOFC, which convert chemical energy to electrical energy, highly depends on the oxide-ion
conductivity of electrolyte! *. Presently, high operating temperature (> 1073 K) is the primary

| at low

limitation for SOFC’. Electrolytes with oxygen ionic conductivity higher than 10 S cm
temperature (< 500 K) are favorable for a cost-effective SOFC**. Although, significant studies on
ionic conductivity in oxide electrolytes have been reported in the literature*®, suitable material for
oxide electrolytes still remains elusive. Among the oxide electrolytes, yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ-
Z10.92Y 0.160208, duc ~ 10° S cm" at ~ 1073 K) is mostly being used in commercial SOFC’. However,
due to its high operating temperature, the associated cost for its operation remains significantly high,
and efficiency reduces rapidly. To reduce the operating costs and degradation rates, considerable
studies are being conducted to lower the working temperature either by material engineering or by
discovering new materials *-’:*. In present days, research in solid oxide electrolytes primarily focuses
to achieve the desired value of ionic conductivity (= 10°? S cm”) at considerably lower temperature,
preferably below ~500 K.

Recently, pyrophosphate compounds have attracted a lot of attention for solid electrolytes and ionic
conductors”? . Among these pyrophosphates, the divalent-pyrophosphate compounds fall in a family
with the general formula M2P207, where M = divalent alkaline or transition metal cations (M = Mg,
Ca, Sr, Ba, Mn, Cu, Ni, Zn, Co, Cd, Pb). These compounds appear to be crystalized in two distinct
crystal structure conformations (thortveitite and dichromate) which are characterized by the values of
ionic radius (IR) of M cation'*:'>. For the thortveitite structure, radius of M cation (M = Mg, Mn, Cu,
Ni, Zn, Co) is less than 0.97 A. On the other hand, for the dichromate structure, radius of M cation (M
= Ca, Sr, Ba, Pb, Cd) is greater than 0.97 A. The MoP207 compounds are low-cost, nontoxicity and

eco-friendly materials, having good conductivity, chemical and thermal stability!

as well as easy to
synthesis. The M2P207 compounds show a crystal structural phase transition from low-temperature a-
phase to high-temperature /#-phase. In this M2P2O7 family, the transition metal-based compound
copper pyrophosphate CuzP207, is of our present interest. As a prospective material, the compound
CuzP207 has attracted much attention due to its some intriguing and anomalous properties as well as
applications, including strong negative thermal expansion, electrochemical, sensors and energy storage
devices'’?’, The compound Cu2P207 has excellent reversible crystal structural property!°. The
CuzP207 is nonhygroscopic and stable in air up to 1443 K, where after it decomposes into Cus(PO«)2
and Cu®. While in argon atmosphere, the material does not decompose up to 1473 K**. The compound
with good crystal structural stability offers a long-term durability, and therefore, can maintain stable
ionic conductivity over a long-period of operation of a real SOFC cell.

The compound Cu2P207 with thortveitite crystal structure (Monoclinic, space group: C2/c) exhibits a
stable phase (a-phase) at room temperature and undergoes a reversible phase transition to /-phase
(Monoclinic, space group: C2/m) at 350 K!’:*°. The key difference between a-phase and (phase is
the positional disorder of the bridging O1 atom in the P-O1-P bridge of [P207] unit in the #-phase.
Although Cu2P207 reveals a strong crystal structural stability, the oxygen ionic conductivity of

Page 2 of 35
Cu2P207 is reported to be low ~1.14x 10° S cm’! at 300 K'', which is not suitable for SOFC. Therefore,
it is necessary to find ways to enhance the ionic conductivity of Cu2P207 for its possible applications
in SOFC. Further, the nature of temperature dependence of the ionic conductivity as well as underlying
mechanism of ionic conduction is unknown, which demands a detailed temperature dependent ionic
conductivity study. An effective route to enhance the ionic conductivity of Cu2P207 is V-substitution
at P site. The reported results reveal that the solubility of V in Cu2zP2-xVxO7 is 100% where the
substituted compounds retain a monoclinic phase (C2/c) up to x ~ 1.5 and then transformed to
orthorhombic phase (Fdd2) without appearance of any secondary phase”’. The temperature-dependent
high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction study on the x =1 (Cu2PVO7) compound reported that
the compound is thermally stable with monoclinic phase up to the highest measured temperature of
773 K?’.

The present study aims to synthesize the compounds Cu2P2-xVxO7 (x= 0,0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1) using the
solid-state reaction method and investigate their ionic conduction, electrical and crystal structural
properties by impedance spectroscopy and x-ray/neutron diffraction, respectively. To maintain
structural consistency with the parent compound CuzP207 (x = 0), and to enable a reliable and
systematic comparison of conductivity data within the same monoclinic structural framework, we,
have restricted our study over the V substitution range x = 0-1. The XPS and DC transport number
measurements were employed to determine the valence states of the cations, and the contributions of
ionic and electronic conductivity to the total conductivity, respectively. Our detailed analysis shows
a two orders of magnitude enhancement of the ionic conductivity in Cu2P207 by a larger V>*-
substitution at the P>* site. At the same time, a decrease of activation energy (4a) from 1.47(2) eV for
x =0 to 1.31(2) eV for x =1 is achieved. Further, we have determined the diffusivity, hopping rate of
oxide ions, as well as microscopic mechanism of ionic conduction. The results reveal the correlated
barrier hopping (CBH) process for ionic conduction mechanism. The analysis of XPS spectra confirms
mono-valance state for Cu, P and V ions, i., Cu2*, P** and V>+. The DC transport number
measurements reveal that the electronic transference number is negligible (below 5%), confirming that
the observed conductivity predominantly arises from the ionic contribution (> 95%). The oxide ion
conduction pathways within the crystal structure are illustrated by a comprehensive soft-bond valence
sum (BVS) analysis of neutron diffraction patterns. Present work, thus, provides a potential route to
increase the oxide ionic conductivity of Cu2P207, as well as understanding of the microscopic
conduction mechanism and the determination of ionic conduction pathways, which are useful for the
advancement of SOFC devices.

2. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

The powder samples of copper pyrophosphate compounds (Cu2P2-xVxO7,x = 0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1)
were synthesized by the solid-state reaction method. The stoichiometric mixtures (as per required
compositions) of high purity (Sigma-Aldrich, > 99.99%) precursors of CuO, V2Os and (NH4)2HPO4
were well ground using agate mortar and pestle. In the first stage, mixed powders were calcinated at
573 K for 6 hours to remove NH3 and H20. In the second stage, the calcined powders were ground
again and pelletized, and then sintered at 1073 K for 24 hours.

The phase purity of synthesized polycrystalline compounds of CuzP2.xVxO7 (x = 0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1)
has been confirmed by both x-ray diffraction (XRD) and neutron powder diffraction (NPD) at room

Page 3 of 35
temperature. The x-ray diffraction measurements were carried out over a scattering angular range of
10° < 20 < 70° with a scan step size of 0.02° using a laboratory-based x-ray diffractometer (make:
Rigaku, Japan) with a standard Cu K, source. The neutron diffraction measurements were carried out
using the PD-1 diffractometer*’ (A= 1.094 A), comprised of three linear position sensitive neutron
detectors covering an angular range of 4°-70°, at Dhruva Research Reactor, BARC, Mumbai. The
powders samples were filled inside an 8 mm cylindrical vanadium-can. The neutron diffraction pattern
was recorded for around 12 hours. The analysis of powder diffraction patterns was carried out by the
Rietveld refinement method with the help of the Fullprof computer program*!. The soft-bond valence

32

sum (BVS) analysis was performed using the Bond_STR program”, an inbuilt package in Fullprof
computer program. The migration pathways were plotted using the VESTA software**. The x-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out for all the compounds CuzP2-xVxO7
(x = 0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1) using the synchrotron radiation at BL-14 beam line, Indus 2 at Synchrotron
Radiation Facility, RRCAT, India.

For the impedance measurements, fine powders of Cu2P2xV,O7 were pressed into disc shaped pellets
(10 mm diameter) under 10 Ton pressure using a hydraulic press machine. Further, the pellets were
isothermally sintered at 1073 K for 6 hours to increase the density above 90% of the theoretical density.
The flat surfaces of pellets were uniformly coated with gold paste and dried at 573 K for 3 hours before
performing measurements. Impedance measurements were performed using a PSM1735—NumetriQ
impedance analyzer (Newtons4th Ltd., U.K.) with an ac electric field amplitude of 0.4 V and in the
frequency (f) range of 1-10’ Hz, over a temperature range of 423-993 K in air. The EIS Spectrum
Analyser software** was used for the impedance data analysis. The measured impedance data were
corrected by employing the density correction following a procedure as reported in literature*>. The
DC transport number measurements*°

0, 0.8 and 1 compounds, under a fixed applied de voltage (0.5 V for x = 0; 0.2 V for x = 0.8 and 1,

were carried out at room temperature on the representative x =

respectively) across the pellets using the ion-blocking gold electrodes. The data were recorded using
the BioLogic make SP-300 Potentiostat.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Crystal Structural Properties

The crystal structural properties of Cu2P2-xVxO7 (x = 0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1) compounds have been
investigated by combined XRD and NPD studies. The XRD and NPD patterns for all the compounds
are shown in Figures la and lc~g, respectively. The diffraction patterns for all the compounds x = 0-
1 have been indexed corresponding to the standard data of ICSD_CollCodel4369 and
ICSD_CollCode121992, reporting the same monoclinic crystal structure with space group C2/c. The
Rietveld analysis of the XRD and NPD patterns reveals that all the compounds belong to the a-phase
with Monoclinic symmetry (space group: C2/c)”’”’. The refined values of crystal structural parameters
and unit cell volumes are listed in Table |. The analyses confirm that the vanadium (V) ions are
substituted at the P site. The confirmation of V-substitution at the P site is evident from the shifting of
Bragg peaks towards lower value of momentum transfer (Q) with increasing the substitution. The
shifting of Bragg peaks reveals an increase of lattice constants and unit cell volume with the
substitution of larger V>** ions (IR: 0.35 A) at the position of smaller P** ions (IR: 0.17 A).A large
shifting of nuclear Bragg peak (-202) towards a lower Q value is observed. The detailed composition-

Page 4 of 35
dependent shiftings of some of the observed Bragg peaks are shown in Figures 1b and 1h, respectively,
for XRD and NPD patterns. Detailed analyses reveal that with the V-substitution, the lattice constants
a and c increase linearly, whereas lattice constant b slightly decreases [Figure 2a]. It is also observed
that the unit cell volume (V) and monoclinic angle # increase linearly with increasing the concentration
(x) of vanadium [Figure 2b]. The normalized changes of a,b,c, Gand V with respect to x= 0 compound
are shown in Figure 2c. The observed changes in the unit cell volume V for x = 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and | are
~3.90 %, 6.04 %, 8.06 % and 10.43 % with reference to the x = 0 compound.

A schematic of crystal structure is shown in Figure 3a. Within the unit cell, there are eight Cu atoms,
eight B (P or P/V) atoms, and twenty-eight O atoms. Cu atoms occupy the 8f site, B atoms occupy the
8f site, and O atoms occupy the 8f and 4e sites. It is mentioned that Cu, B, and O atoms each occupy
symmetrically-distinct 8f sites, listed in Table |. The unit cell consists of two different polyhedral
units, viz., CuOs pyramidal and BOs (B = P, V) tetrahedral units. The Cu atom coordinates with five
O atoms (two O2, two O3, and one 04) and forms CuOs pyramid, and the B-site atom coordinates
with four O atoms (O1, O2, O03, and 04) to form BOs tetrahedron [Figure 3b]. The CuOs pyramids
and BOs tetrahedra make alternating layers along the crystallographic c-axis. Within a given layer (ab
plane), the edge-shared CuOs units (sharing their O2-O2 and 03-03 edges) make a zigzag chain along
the diagonal direction in the same plane. The arrangements of the zigzag chains are along opposite
diagonal directions in the adjacent layers. Adjacent CuQOs layers are linked by corner-shared B2O7
groups (sharing O02, O03, and O04 atoms at the corners) which are formed by two BOs tetrahedral units
sharing O1 atoms at the vertex (making B-O1-B bridge) [Figure 3b]. The substitution of larger V>* ion
at the P>* site reduces the rigidity of the polyhedra by increasing BOs polyhedra volume and BO4
average bond length as well as unit cell volume. The values of unit cell volume, BO4 polyhedra volume,
and BO, average bond length increase by 10.43 %, 20 % and 6 %, respectively, for vanadium
substitution of x = 1. Additionally, angular distortion in CuOs and stretching distortion in BO increase
with the V-substitution. The increase in unit cell and polyhedral volumes is expected to facilitate easier
ion migration. An increase in bond length reduces the bond strength, which is expected to make easier
for oxide ions conduction. An enhancement of oxygen ionic conductivity is, therefore, expected with
the V-substitution in the present study as discussed later.

3.2. Valence State of Cations

To further examine the valence states of cations in Cu2P2-.V,O7 (x = 0,0.4,0.6,0.8 and 1), i.e., valence
states of V, Cu, and P, XPS spectra were recorded for all the compounds. The V 2p3/2 spectra are
shown in Figures 3d—g, revealing V 2p32 peak with binding energy of ~517 eV, confirming the V**
valence sate*’. The spectra of Cu 3s and P 2p are shown in Figures 3h-1. The spectra are fitted with
Cu 3s (main + satellite) and P 2p peaks. The Cu 3s and P 2p peaks with binding energy of ~125 eV
and ~ 133 eV correspond to the Cu?* and P** valence sates*®“?, respectively. The Cu 2p3/2 spectra are
shown in Figures 3m—q. The Cu 2p3 spectra were fitted with Cu** multiplet peaks. The analyses
reveal a main peak with binding energy of ~935.2 eV accompanied by the characteristic shakeup
satellite peaks (938-945 eV). The binding energy of ~935.2 eV corresponding to the Cu?* valence

40, 38

sate . Therefore, the XPS results confirm the presence of Cu2*, P>t and V>* valence states, i.e.,

mono-valence cations in all the Cu2P2-.V,O7 (x = 0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1) compounds.

3.3. Electrical Conduction Properties

3.3.1 De Conductivity

The real part Z’ and imaginary part Z” of the complex impedance Z* = Z’— jZ”" for all the compounds
(x = 0,04, 0.6, 0.8, and 1), measured at various temperatures (T) as a function of frequency ( f ), are
shown in Figures 4a-e and 4f-j, respectively. For x = 0.6 and 0.8, a non-monotonic behavior has been
found in the temperature dependent Z’ value. With increasing temperature, Z' value first decreases
gradually up to 603 K, then increases with further increasing temperature up to ~ 653 K (for x = 0.6)
and ~ 633 K (for x = 0.8), and then decreases again up to highest measured temperature of 993 K. On
the other hand, for the compounds with x = 0, 0.4, and 1, with increasing temperature, Z’ value
decreases monotonically over the whole temperature range up to 993 K with a change in the rate
around the intermediate temperature range. The overall decreasing trend of Z’ with increasing
temperature (except for the x = 0.6 and 0.8 compounds over the intermediate temperature range)
suggests a negative temperature coefficient of resistance, hence, a semi-conducting behavior. The non-
monotonic behavior of resistance in the intermediate temperature range is observed around the crystal
structural phase transition (from the a to the f-phase) temperature, where resistance increases with
increasing the temperature. Such a change in the temperature coefficient of resistance from -ve to +ve
with increasing temperature was also reported for BaTiO3 and Ti doped SrFeO3 ceramic compounds"!
* around the crystal structural phase transition temperature and the positive coefficient of the
resistance is reported due to charge trapping at the acceptor states around the phase transition
temperature. As the trapped charges are not available for conduction, an increase in the resistivity is
found. A similar charge trapping phenomena may be responsible for the increase of the resistance in
the intermediate temperature range for the studied compounds. For all the present compounds, each of
the Z” (f) curves exhibits a peak at a characteristic frequency fz at all measured temperatures. The
existence of peak indicates a presence of relaxation phenomena. The peak in the Z” curve shifts
towards higher frequencies with increasing temperature. The shifting of the peak frequency towards
the higher frequencies with increasing temperature reveals a decrease in the relaxation time (tz), hence
a faster ionic conduction. The presence of a distribution of relaxation time in the studied materials (as
evident from the board peaks) reveals the non-Debye type relaxation process. In real materials like the
studied compounds, the distribution of relaxation time has been found due to the presence of non-
uniform grain-size distribution, non-uniform grain and grain boundary-orientation, and crystal

structural disorder. Relaxation time (zz) can be calculated using the formula:

1
a Inf qd)

where, fz is the characteristic frequency at which the Z” reaches its maximum value. The value of tz
decreases with increasing the temperature to 993 K. An opposite behavior has been observed over the
603-653 K (for x = 0.6) and 603-633 K (for x = 0.8) around the crystal structural phase transition

temperature corresponding to the a to £-phase transition.

The Cole-Cole (-Z” vs Z’) plots'*:“* are shown in Figures 5a—g, for all the compounds at selected
temperatures. The experimental data were best fitted with an equivalent circuit (based on the brick-
layer model**) [Figure Si] over the whole measured temperature range up to 993 K. The equivalent
circuit consists of two sub-circuits connected in series. The first subcircuit contains resistance (Rg) and
a constant phase element (CPE,) in parallel, representing the grain contribution to the ionic

Page 6 of 35
conductivity*’. The second subcircuit contains a constant phase element (CPEgp) alongside the parallel
Rgp-Cgp elements to account for the grain boundary contribution. The presence of a constant phase
element (CPE)“ reveals the deviation from the ideal Debye-type behavior and the existence of a

distribution of the relaxation time. The impedance of CPE in the complex plane is defined as:

4
ZcpE = Duep (2)

where, Q is the value of capacitance of CPE, and p is the fractal exponent ranges between 0 and 1.

A6

When p = 0 and 1, CPE behaves as an ideal resistor and ideal capacitor’®, respectively.

The total de conductivity ouc was calculated from the following relation:

t t
A(Rg+Rgb) A Rac

Ode (3)

where, A, t and Rac represent the area of the cross-section, thickness and total resistance of the pellet,
respectively. Total resistance Rac, which is equivalent to the sum of the individual’s contribution of
grain and grain boundary resistance i.e., Rac = Rg + Rgb,, was obtained from the fitting of the Cole-Cole
plots and corresponding to the intersect of the extrapolated Cole-Cole curve to the Z’-axis (X-axis) at
the zero frequency. Figure 6a shows the temperature dependence of the total de conductivity (oac)
derived using Eq. (3) for all the compounds. The Arrhenius plots [aac (T) = (60 /T) exp (—Ea/ kpT)] of
the Ouc curves reveal straight lines over lower and higher temperature regions with anomalies around
the structural phase transition temperature of the respective compounds [Figures 6b-f]. In the
Arrhenius relation, oo is the pre-exponential factor, and it depends upon the concentration of mobile

charge carriers*’*“*, E,

, is the activation energy for ionic conduction, and kg is the Boltzmann constant.
Activation energy Ea and pre-exponential factor oo are determined from the linear fits [Figures 6b-f].
The activation energies E, lie in the range of 0.43-1.04 eV for the a-phase and in the range of 1.19-
1.47 eV for the phase. The value of de conductivity increases with increasing temperature. Such
temperature dependence behaviour of dc conductivity confirms the thermally activated ionic
conduction. It is found that all the ode, Ea and oo parameters show a strong dependence on the
substitution of V-content. The variations of Ea and oo with composition are shown in Figures 6g and
6h, respectively. In the a-phase, both E, and op steadily increase with increasing the x-value. On the
other hand, in the phase, both E, and oo values remain almost constant. It is noticeable that for a
particular composition, the value of oo is higher in the 4phase as compared to that of the a@-phase
which indicates that the increase in mobile charge carrier concentration leading to an increase in de
conductivity. Most important result is that in the #-phase, a two orders of magnitude enhancement of
conductivity has been found with the 50% V-substitution, i.e., x= 1. We discuss below the mechanism
of ionic conduction and the possible origin of the enhancement of ionic conductivity with the V-
substitution.

3.3.2. DC Transport Number

The relative contributions of ionic and electronic conductions have been measured using the DC
transport number measurements on the representative compounds x = 0, 0.8 and 1. In this technique, a
fixed DC voltage is applied across the sample and the DC current is monitored as a function of time.
The results of these measurements are shown in Figure 5h. It is noticeable that, initially, the current

Page 7 of 35
decreases rapidly with time due to the blocking of the ionic species by the blocking electrode and then
attains a constant value (corresponding to the electronic current ie) under fully blocked condition. The
electronic transference numbers (te) = ic/it, where it is initial/total current, are determined to be 0.0295
for x = 0, 0.0453 for x = 0.8 and 0.0456 for x = 1, respectively. The corresponding ionic transference
numbers (t; = l- te) are 0.9705 for x = 0,0.9547 for x= 0.8 and 0.9544 for x = 1, respectively. Therefore,
the above results corroborate that conductivity in the studied compounds Cu2P2xV,O7 arises
predominantly (> 95%) from ionic conduction. The low fraction of electronic conduction (<5%) is
also supported by the DFT results of Cu2P207 which predict an insulating state with a large band gap
of Ey = 3.17 eV*°. Experimentally the electronic band gap value is determined to be Eg = 3.95 eV”
which is not favorable for electronic conduction.

3.3.3 Diffusivity and Hopping Rate

The diffusion constant (diffusivity) D of oxide ions conduction has been determined from the dc
conductivity data for the two end compounds with x = 0 and 1. The diffusion constant D is derived
based on the Nernst—Einstein relationship, as used for other compound [Ref. 33].:

Oa kgT
Ng (4)
where, N is the concentration of oxide ions, q is the ionic charge of oxide ion (q = -2e for oxygen ion)
and oac is the de conductivity. The temperature dependence of D values for the x= 0 and 1 compounds
are shown in Figure 61. The value of D increases with increasing temperature for both the compounds
with x = 0 and | in the #phase. Whereas, the value of D for the x = 1 compound (~6.49x10"!! cm?/sec
at 773 K) is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the x = 0 compound (~6.11x10"'? cm?/sec at
773 K) over the full temperature range in the #-phase [Figure 6i]. Furthermore, the hopping rate (Az),
defined by the time taken by an ion to hop from initial site to the final site, of mobile oxide ions was
determined using the equation*’:

< P>

2dD

(5)

where, <1*> is the mean square jump length (hopping distance) of mobile oxide ions. The <1?> values
(an average distance between the neighboring oxygen ion sites) have been calculated from the crystal
structural parameters obtained from Rietveld analyses of x-ray and neutron diffraction patterns. The d
is the dimensionality of oxide ion diffusion, For the studied compounds, d =3, due to the three-
dimensional oxide ion migration (a detailed discussion is given in Section 3.2.6). The temperature
dependent hopping rate curves for the x = 0 and 1 compounds are shown in Figure 6j. For both the
compounds (i.e.,x = 0 and 1), the hopping rate decreases with increasing temperature. Moreover, it is
observed that value of At for the x = | is two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the x = 0
compound, suggesting a faster ionic conduction for the compound with x = | [Figure 6j].

3.34 Ac Conductivity

The ionic conduction mechanism for the studied compounds Cu2P2-xVxO7 (x = 0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1)
has been investigated by frequency (f) dependent ac conductivity. The complex conductivity (o*) is
defined as:

Page 8 of 35
o* =o'+jo" (6)
where, o’ and o" are the real and imaginary parts of o*. The real part o’ is derived from the measured
complex impedance data:

(2 °+2"")

where, Z’ and Z” are the real and imaginary parts of the complex impedance, respectively; Ais area of

the cross-section, and t is thickness of the pellet. The frequency dependent o’ curves, measured at
several temperatures, are shown in Figures 7a-e. The conductivity values at low frequency region (f <
10? Hz) remain constant [Figures 7a-e] which are attributed to frequency-independent dc conductivity
(o’ ~ o’dc). Whereas, at high frequency region (f >10? Hz), the conductivity value increases with
increasing frequency (f) suggesting frequency induced conductivity. With the increasing temperature,
plateau region shifts towards a higher value of frequency for all the compounds. The contribution of
dispersive component is more prominent at low temperatures. Here, we would like to point out that
the effect of temperature is more predominant than that of the frequency. Each of the ac conductivity
curves is fitted with the Jonscher’s universal power law’:
o (T,f)=o'ac(T) + 6(T)f" (8)

where, Gac is the frequency-independent dc conductivity. The ¢(T) is the pre-exponential factor, and n
is the frequency-exponent. Exponent n ranging from 0 to | describes the degree of interactions between
charge carriers and their surrounding environment, and € describes the strength of polarizability of
hopping ions*!. The Jonscher’s power law describes the dynamic response of charge carriers and has
been used for the determination of conduction mechanism for different types of materials including
ceramics, fast ionic conductors, doped ionic crystal, ion conducting glasses, disordered semiconductor
and polymer**:**:>°:>?"_ The value of the o’ dc, obtained from the ac conductivity analysis, is found to
be same as ouc reduced from Cole-Cole plot and shown in Figure 6. The second term in Eq. (8) takes
an account of the dispersion part, and provides a vital information of the conduction mechanism.

The conduction mechanism can be determined from the nature of the temperature dependent n (T)
curves. Different theoretical models for the conduction mechanism, such as, the quantum mechanical
tunneling (QMT), the classical hopping over a barrier (HOB), the correlated barrier hopping (CBH),
the nonoverlapping small polaron tunneling (NSPT), and the overlapping large polaron tunneling
(OLPT) can be distinguished based on the nature of the temperature variation of n *°>’. In the QMT
and HOB models, the value of n (T) is independent of temperature with a constant value of ~ 0.81 and
1, respectively. For the NSPT model, the value of n (T) increases with increasing temperature.
Whereas, for the OLPT model, the value of n (T) decreases with increasing temperature and attends a
minimum value at a characteristic temperature, and then subsequently increases with increasing
temperature. For the CBH model, the value of n (T) is less than unity, and decreases with increasing
temperature. According to the CBH model, the motion of charge carrier occurs through hopping
between the crystal sites over the Coulomb potential barrier separating them. The height of Coulomb
potential barrier is correlated with the intersite separation of charge carriers. In this model, the
frequency-exponent n is expressed (with first approximation) as”°:
_ d(ino’) _ 6kgT
din Wy

where, Ww is the effective Coulomb potential barrier. The values of the parameters n and € were
determined from the fitting of the experimental ac conductivity data by Eq. (8). The temperature
dependence of the parameters n and ¢ are shown in Figures 7f and 7g, respectively. For all the
compounds, the fitted values of n are less than unity (1) and decrease with increasing temperature. The
value of n smaller than unity defines a non-zero de conductivity. The decrease of n value with
increasing temperature reveals that the ionic conduction occurs through CBH. For the compound x =
0, a sharp decrease in the n value is observed at a characteristic temperature of Tn ~ 900 K. With the
increase in x value, the characteristic temperature T, decreases rapidly, and attains ~ 630 K for the x =
0.6 compound. Beyond x= 0.6, the sharp decrease in the n value occurs at a slightly higher temperature
of T; ~ 720 K. The sharp decrease in the n value suggests a higher ionic conduction. The decrease of
Tn implies a higher ionic conduction at lower temperatures for the V-substituted compounds [Figure
7f]. Furthermore, the correlated and relaxation hopping behaviour of the mobile ions can be explained
by the jump relaxation model**-°*. In this model, the frequency-exponent n can be expressed as n =
b,/s;, which is the ratio of the back-hop rate (b;) to the site relaxation or hole digging rate (s,). The
backward hop motion of a hopping ion is caused by the repulsive Coulombic interaction between the
mobile ions. The site relaxation is the shift of a site potential minimum to the position of the hopping
ion (after the hopping process to the site), which is caused by the rearrangements of neighboring ions~.
With increasing the temperature, a decrease of n value towards zero indicates that the site relaxation
becomes faster than the backward hopping, resulting in a translation motion of the charge carriers. A
decrease of n (= b,/s;) value is evident with increasing the V-substitution, indicating a higher de
conduction in the forward direction. The temperature dependence of the pre-exponential factor &
reveals that there is no discernible change in up to 600 K. The € value increases significantly above
600 K, reflecting a change in the strength of polarizability of hopping ions as well as hopping range in
the /-phase [Figure 7g]. Furthermore, € value increases with x. A higher value of ¢ indicates a higher
carrier ionic mobility, leading to an enhanced ionic conductivity.

3.3.5 Electric Modulus

Electric modulus has been widely employed to study conductivity relaxation phenomenon of various
compounds*:*. This formalism has an advantage as it does not contain the contribution of the
polarization effect from the electrode or/and mobile ion®’. The complex form of electric modulus is

represented as:

M* = M'+j M" = jaCoZ* (10)

where, Co is the vacuum capacitance and Z* is the complex impedance. The values of real part (M’)
and imaginary part (M’’) of M* are derived from the measured impedance data using the following
relations as:
'_oo_on @ Aeg
M' = ~2" x (22) a)

and

M"= 2x (=) (12)

Page 10 of 35
where, €0 is the free space permittivity, w is the angular frequency, and the others symbols have
their usual meaning as mentioned earlier.

The frequency dependence of the real part (M’) and imaginary part (M’’) of the complex electric
modulus (M*) at selected temperatures are shown in Figures 8a—e and 8f-j, respectively, for all the
compounds. At a given temperature, M’ has nearly zero value in the low frequency region and remains
constant up to a characteristic frequency, and then rises suddenly and gets saturated at a higher
frequency. Such frequency dependent behavior is found at all temperatures with an enhanced
characteristic frequency (fm) with increasing temperature.

For all the compounds, imaginary part (M’’) of electric modulus shows a single relaxation peak at all
measured temperatures. The observed peak in the M’’ curve is broad and asymmetric in nature. Such
behaviors indicate a non-Debye type relaxation process associated with ionic conduction having a
distribution of relaxation time*’, as found from the impedance data. The observed peak position (fu)
in M’’ curve shifts toward higher frequencies with increasing temperature revealing a decrease in
relaxation time (zm), signifying a faster movement of charge carriers. This type of behavior of M’’
suggests the thermally activated conduction relaxation process following the hopping mechanism. The
relaxation time (zm) is determined from the experimental M’’ data using the formula:

t= (13)

The temperature dependence of ty is shown in Figure 9d by Arrhenius plots for all the compounds. With
increasing temperature (T), i.e., decreasing 1000/T, the value of mm decreases grossly. As like, the impedance
data, a reversed behavior is found around the structural phase transition temperature (603-653 K for x =0.6
and 603-633 K for x = 0.8) [Figure 9d inset].

For an ionic conductor, imaginary part (M’’) of modulus curve can be represented by the modified
Kohlraush—Williams—Watts (KWW) function in the frequency domain. The experimentally measured M’’
data are fitted using the modified KWW function™ as:

"
Mmax

M" =
(1-0)+(=35) of +)(in) Ge)

where, M’’max is the maximum value of M’”’ relaxation peak at the characteristic frequency fu. The
shape of each M’’ curve in M”’ spectra is quantified with the fitted values of @. Temperature dependence of
the @ value is shown in Figure 9a for all the compounds. At lower temperature (~ 423 K), the values of D
lie within the range of 0.64—0.8 for all the compounds. The deviation of @ value from ‘1’ reveals a non-
Debye type relaxation process*"°!, With increasing the temperature, a sharp increase in @ value is
observed at ~ 773 K for x = 0.4, ~ 673 K for x = 0.6, ~ 623 for x = 0.8 and ~ 573 K for x = 1. Above
these temperatures, the @ attains a saturation value of ~ 0.97 close to ‘1’, revealing the relaxation
moves toward a Debye-type process. It is further evident that the effect of temperature on @ is more
dominant as the V-concentration increases. The variation of the characteristic frequency (fm) with the
V-concentration (x) is shown by the M’’?/ M’ ‘max (f) curves [Figure 9c] at a selected temperature of
773 K in the £-phase. An increase of fm with increasing V-concentration (x) is evident, suggesting a
decrease in mm. Within the f-phase, a sharp decrease of the mm value is observed [Figures 9e—j],
revealing a faster ionic conduction with increasing the V-substitution.

3.3.6 Dielectric Constant and Loss Factor
To estimate the contribution of local dipole-dipole relaxation, the dielectric properties have been
investigated. The complex dielectric constant (e*) can be expressed as:

et =e’ -je” (15)
The values of real part (e") and imaginary part (¢’’) of e* are derived from the measured impedance
data using the following relations as:

”

ee: Z
°O" say GFA (16)
and
a: z
O)= Sam GaP? (17)

The real part (e’) represents the ability of the material to store electrical energy, and the imaginary part
(e’’) represents an electrical energy loss (dissipation) in the material. The frequency responses of ¢’
and ¢’’ are shown in Figures |0a-e and 10f-j, respectively, at selected temperatures. The ¢’ data reveal
that for a fixed temperature the value of «’ decreases with increasing frequency.

The e’’(f) curves decrease with increasing frequency at a fixed temperature [Figures |0f—j]. On the
other hand, the value of <’’ increases with increasing temperature at a given frequency. The absence
of any relaxation peak in the «’’ curves over the measured temperature and frequency ranges reveals
the absence of any localized dipole relaxation in the studied compounds. The complex dielectric
constant can also be expressed in terms of electric modulus (¢* = 1/ M*). For a pure conduction
process, a relaxation peak is typically observed in the M’’(f) curves, however, no peak is observed in
the e’’(f) curves. The appearance of relaxation peak in both M’’(f) and e’’(f) curves corresponds to a

pure localized dipole relaxation process** ©

. Acomparison between M’ (f) and e’ (f) curves for all the
compounds (x = 0-1) reveals that the relaxation peaks appear only in the M’’(f) curves [Figures 8f-j],
not in the e’(f) curves [Figures 10f—j], confirming an absence of local dipole relaxation. Moreover,
the relaxation peaks in M’ ’(f) curves and Z’(f) curves appear at the same frequency values [Figure 9b],
revealing that the conductivity relaxation process is associated to the oxygen ion conduction as well
as long-range ionic conduction. Furthermore, the same values of frequency positions for relaxation
peaks indicate the electrical homogeneity of material. At high temperatures (f-phase), value of ¢’’
increases with increasing the V-substitution, which can be related to the increase in conductivity with
the substitution of V. For all temperatures, the <’’(f) data are fitted by a universal power law**:*?:

é’ (T, @) =a(T) o™ (18)
where, a(T) and m(T) are the temperature dependent proportional constant and exponent, respectively.
The value of exponent m decreases with increasing temperature, and at approaches to a constant value
“-1” [Figure l10p]. With increasing temperature, the decrease in m value supports the thermally
activated oxygen ion conduction through the CBH process, as concluded from the ac ionic conductivity

study [Figure 7f].

Page 12 of 35
The dielectric loss factor (tan 6) can be determined using the following equation:

6=—=—_= 1
tan F (19)

The frequency responses of tan 6 are shown in Figures 10k-o, respectively, for all the compounds.
Each tan 6 curve exhibits a peak at a characteristic frequency (fians). Overall, the tan 6 value decreases
with increasing frequency due to the frequency-activated conduction process. With increasing
temperature, the value of tan 6 increases, and tan d-peak shifts towards the higher frequencies. It is
interesting to note that with increasing the V-substitution, fians shifts towards the high frequency side.
The increase of fians with increasing the V-substitution suggests that the hopping/ jumping

probability of mobile ions increases with the increasing x-value, i.e., V>*-substitution.

3.3.7. Soft-Bond Valence Sum Analysis

The oxide ion conduction pathways in Cu2P2-xVxO7 (x = 0-1) have been determined by employing the
soft-bond valence sum (BVS) analysis. The BVS analysis has been applied successfully to estimate
the most probably oxide ion conduction pathways in oxide ion conducting materials, such as, oxide
ion electrolytes* °°. An empirical relationship (valence sum rule) between bond length and valence
state of the ion is used to identify the possible conduction pathways’. The relationship is represented
as:

Vi=X sy =Zexp [(Ro-7)/b] (20)
where, Vj is the valence of the i" atom, si and ry are the bond valence and bond length distance,
respectively, between i‘ and j atom. Ro and b are the empirical bond valence parameters. For the
present BVS calculation, the global cutoff distance is considered to be 8 A, so that Ro and b attain their
constant values beyond this. Any deviation of V; from ideal valence Vo indicates a dynamical disorder
of O-ions. The bond valence mismatch AV =| Vi — Vol =| Vi— 2I indicates the accessible volume within
the structure for ionic migration. The refined crystal structural parameters [Table |] obtained from the
Rietveld analysis of the neutron diffraction patterns [Figure |] are utilized as an input to the BVS
calculation. The conduction pathways have been determined for the bond valence mismatch AV = 0.2
valence units (v.u). The possible oxide ion migration pathways for the representative compounds with
x = 0 (at 300 K in a@-phase and 673 K in £ -phase) and x = | (at 625 K in #-phase) are shown in Figure
11. A 3D oxygen ionic conduction is evident. The major oxide ion migration pathways are along the
diagonal directions of ac plane [Figure | la], as well as be plane [Figure | 1b] and along the b axis
[Figure llc] of the ab plane. Such migration pathways are connected to form three-dimensional
network within the crystal structure. The BVS analysis reveals that available volume for oxide ion
conduction within the unit cell increases with increasing x value. For x = 0, the available volume for
ionic conduction at 573 and 673 K are 32.1 and 32.3 A}, respectively. Whereas, for the x = 1, the
available volume for ionic conduction is 35.2 A? at 625 K (estimated from the reported data in Ref.
27);

4. DISCUSSION

In the present study, we have demonstrated an enhancement of two orders of ionic conductivity by

Page 13 of 35
50% V>*-substitution at P** site in Cu2P207. Although the targeted value of conductivity (+10? S-cm™
at < 500 K) is not achieved in the present work, our results demonstrate a pathway for the enhancement
of conductivity through a targeted substitution. The demonstration of the concept will be useful for the
research area of SOFC. Here, we compare the ionic conductivity of the present compounds Cu2P2.
xVxO7 (x = 0-1) [Figure 12] with that of the other isostructural pyrophosphate compounds as well as
with zirconia-based YSZ8 (Zro92Yo0.16O20s), a commercially used electrolyte material of SOFC. The
conductivity of the parent compound Cu2P207 is found to be in the range of 1077-10 S cm‘! (690-993
K) which is enhanced by the V-substitution to values in the range of 10°10 S cm" for the compound
Cuz2PVO7. Remarkably, the ionic conductivity values for the x = 1 compound i.e., Cuz2PVO7 is close to
that of the YSZ8 compound which is presently extensively used as an electrolyte material in
commercial SOFC cells. One the other hand, when we compare the ionic conductivity value of Cu2P2.
xV,xO7 with that for the other reported members of the pyrophosphate family M2P207, viz., Pb2P207,
Zn2P207, Sr2P207, Ca2P207, Co2P207, Mn2P207 and even at M site Sr**-substituted compound
SrNiP207, it is evident that the compound with x = | i.e., Cux2PVO7 shows one of the highest
conductivity. A comparable ionic conductivity value is evident only for Co2P207 and Mn2P207
compounds from the series. Nevertheless, our study demonstrates, for the first time, a pathway to
enhance the ionic conductivity in the pyrophosphate compounds by Vanadium substitution. We
anticipate that a V-ion substitution at the P site in Co2P207 and Mn2P207 compounds will also lead to
a similar enhancement of ionic conductivity. The present crystal structural studies reveal that the
substitution of larger V-ions for the P-ions increases polyhedra volume and average bond length, and
subsequently an enhancement of the unit cell volume of Cu2P2xVxO7, that increases the (P/V)O4
polyhedral distortion, resulting an enhancement of ionic conductivity. Our BVS analysis also supports
the enhancement of ionic conductivity with increasing the V-substitution.

Now, we shed light on additional practical implications of the studies compounds. The results of our
DC transport number measurements indicate that the present Cu2P2-x.VxO7 compounds have a small
fraction (~ 5%) of electronic conduction in additional to the dominating ionic conductivity. Recently,
Bibi et al.“ have shown that such mixed ionic-electronic conductors (MIEC) can play an important
role in SOFCs as electrode materials. As these materials facilitate both ionic and electronic
conductions as well as simultaneous charge transfer, the overall performance of SOFC, in terms of
power output, mechanical strength, and life efficiency, enhances significantly. The electronic
conduction in a MIEC cathode provides the sustainable reduction of oxygen that is necessary for the
efficient charge transfer for electrons as well as enabling the diffusion and transfer of oxygen ions
through the electrolyte by reducing the polarization resistance. The presence of a small fraction (~ 5%)
of electronic conduction in additional to the dominating ionic conductivity makes the studied
compounds also suitable for new generation MIEC-cathode materials for high performance SOFC.

5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have investigated the electrical (de and ac conductivity, diffusivity, hopping rate,
electric modulus and dielectric properties) and crystal structural properties of the polycrystalline
compounds Cu2P2-xVxO7 (x = 0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1) using the impedance spectroscopy and neutron
diffraction. In addition, the XPS and DC transport number measurements were carried to determine

Page 14 of 35
the valence states of the cations, and the relative contributions of ionic and electronic conductivities,
respectively. We have successfully enhanced the ionic conductivity over two orders of magnitude with
the V-substitution up to 50 atom% in Cu2P2xV,O7. The compound with x =1 shows highest
conductivity among the pyrophosphates M2P207 (M = Zn, Pb, Sr and Ca) family. Further, the V-
substitution enhances significantly the diffusivity and hopping rate of oxide ions. The observed
Arrhenius behavior of the ionic conduction suggests that the conduction process is thermally activated.
The BVS analysis of experimental neutron diffraction patterns highlights the 3D oxide ion conduction
pathways within the crystal structure. The ac conductivity analysis reveals the ionic conduction
mechanism as a correlated barrier hopping (CBH) process. In addition, electric modulus analysis
indicates the faster movement of ions (long-range ionic conduction) with the V-substitution and
provides an evidence for the achievement of highest conductivity. The dielectric analysis also supports
the CBH process for ionic conduction and confirms an absence of any local dipole relaxations in the
studied compounds. Anomalous behavior in electrical properties is found around the crystal structural
phase transition temperature from a to £-phase for all the compounds. Although the targeted value of
conductivity (>10~ S-cm! at <500 K) is not achieved, the present study provides a direction to enhance
the ionic conductivity by a suitable substitution of dopant without altering the charge balance at the
substitution site. Our results yield a small fraction (~ 5%) of electronic conduction in additional to the
dominating ionic conductivity which makes the studied compounds also suitable for new generation
MIEC-cathode materials for high performance SOFC. This study also provides an in-depth
understanding of the ionic conduction mechanism and associated relaxation process. Therefore, the
present study paves a pathway for the enhancement of oxide ionic conductivity, which may be useful
for the design and development of desired oxide-electrolyte materials for SOFCs application.
