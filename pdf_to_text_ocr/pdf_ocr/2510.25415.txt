Magnetic skyrmions have been proposed as promising candidates for storing information due to

their high stability and easy manipul
properties are influenced by the interla

lation by spin-polarized currents. Here, we study how these
yer Dzyaloshinskii—Moriya interaction (IL-DMI), which stabi-

lizes twin-skyrmions in magnetic bilayers. We find that the spin configuration of the twin-skyrmion

adapts to the direction of the IL-DMI

y elongating or changing the helicities in the two layers. Driv-

ing the skyrmions by spin-polarized currents in the current-perpendicular-to-plane configuration, we

observe significant changes either in t:

he skyrmion velocity or in the skyrmion Hall angle depending

on the current polarization. These findings unravel further prospects for skyrmion manipulation

enabled by the IL-DMI.

Chirality is an intriguing physical property of key im-
ortance for modern spintronic devices. The manipula-
ion of chiral magnetic textures has become the focus of
many applications, such as magnetic memories, logic de-
vices, neuromorphic and unconventional computing [I}
[5]. While most studies have focused on planar geome-
ries, recent investigations of spin structures modulated
in all three dimensions have opened new prospects for
3D spintronics. Three-dimensional spin structures have
een studied in bulk chiral magnets [6][7], curvilinear sys-
ems specially shaped nanomagnets [9], and magnetic
multilayers [10].

Skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets, constructed
from ferromagnetic layers coupled by the interlayer ex-
change interaction (IEC), provide an example of such
3D structures 116]. A two-dimensional skyrmion
is formed inside each layer, with the spin directions in
he skyrmions being reversed between the layers due to
he antiferromagnetic coupling. Skyrmions may often be
characterized by two independent parameters : the
vorticity and the helicity. The vorticity is the integer
winding number determining how many times and in
which direction the in-plane spins wind around the out-
of-plane spin in the center, which determines the topo-
logical charge Q when also considering the direction o
the center spin. The helicity angle characterizes the ro-
tational sense of the spins when moving along the ra-
dial direction out from the center, including Bloch-type
and Néel-type rotations. The total topological charge o
synthetic antiferromagnetic skyrmions is zero due to the
symmetric but opposite magnetization between the lay-
ers, which forces the skyrmions to move along the driving
spin-polarized current in the current-in-plane (CIP) ge-
ometry, leading to a suppression of the skyrmion Hal
effect [18]. The cancellation of the topological charge
also strongly enhances the diffusion in these systems [19].
The helicity influences the direction of skyrmion motion
in the current-perpendicular-to-plane (CPP) geometry as

well [20H22], which includes the effect of the so-called
spin-orbit torque [23]. Quantum helicity eigenstates have
been proposed as a basis for skyrmion qubits [24]. The
helicity has been demonstrated to vary in thick magnetic
multilayers due to demagnetization effects [10], and it
may also be influenced by strain and an external mag-

netic field [25].

The antisymmetric counterpart of the IEC is the in-
terlayer Dzyaloshinskii—Moriya interaction (IL-DMI) [26]
[27]. This chiral coupling leads to a non-zero chirality
between the layers [28}{32], which could facilitate field-
free spin-orbit torque switching of the magnetization [33].
However, the influence of the IL-DMI on the equilibrium
structure and the dynamics of skyrmions in multilayers
remains unexplored.

Here, we demonstrate that when two magnetic lay-
ers hosting skyrmions are coupled via IL-DMI, a three-
dimensional topological structure becomes stable, which
we call a twin-skyrmion. We study the structure and
the current-driven motion of such twin-skyrmions using
atomistic spin-dynamics simulations, which are found to
be in favorable agreement with semi-analytical calcula-
tions of the skyrmion profile and the analytical descrip-
tion of the dynamics based on a collective-coordinate ap-
proach. Our theoretical calculations show that the size
and shape of magnetic twin-skyrmions can be effectively
controlled by the IL-DMI, while the helicity may differ
in the top and bottom magnetic layers. These changes
in the skyrmion profiles are demonstrated to influence
the velocity and the skyrmion Hall angle. Since the IL-
DMI can be manipulated by electric fields in synthetic
magnetic bilayers [34], twin-skyrmions may be promis-
ing candidates for spintronic applications based on three-
dimensional spin structures.

FIG. 1. Effect of IL-DMI on Néel-type twin-skyrmions. A schematic of the physical system studied here is shown on the left,
consisting of two magnetic layers and a non-magnetic layer between them. The contributions to the Hamiltonian in Eq.
from the different layers are written inside them. Without IL-DMI the material can host typical Néel-type skyrmions, as seen
in (a). If the IL-DMI lies in the wy plane, the twin-skyrmion becomes elongated along the direction of the IL-DMI vector, as
seen in (b) and (c). Finally, if the IL-DMI points into the out-of-plane z direction, the skyrmions in the two layers twist relative
to each other by changing their helicities. The parameters are J = 12 meV, |D'"| = 3meV, |J'"| = 0.6meV, B* = —3.5T.
The IL-DMI is D' = 0 for (a), D'’ = 8meV - X for (b), D'’ = 8meV - y for (c), and D'’ = 1meV -@ for (d).

RESULTS
Twin-skyrmions formed by IL-DMI

Isolated skyrmions may be stabilized in the magnetic
layers by applying an out-of-plane external magnetic
field, which polarizes the spins along its direction. In
the considered system, these structures are cylindrically
symmetric, and may be described in the continuum limit
in polar coordinates (p, ¢) as follows,

Oi(p,9) = Orl(p), Bile, y) = Biv) = met, (1)
where 1 is the layer index, © and © specify the spin direc-
tions in spherical coordinates, m is the winding number
or vorticity of the skyrmion, and 7) is its helicity. The
topological charge is given as Q = p-m, where p is the
polarity, ie., the sign of the out-of-plane spin component
in the center of the skyrmion. In Fig. [I] skyrmions with
are favored by the IF-DMI, and the external field
is applied along the —z direction, resulting in p = 1 and
Q = 1. We will primarily consider IF-DMI preferring a
Néel-type rotation, resulting in ~ = 0 or a depending
on its sign; but we will also discuss the generalization to
Bloch-type rotation with ~ = 1/2 or —1/2, preferred by
DMI vectors along the lines connecting neighboring sites.

The possible effects of the IL-DMI on the shapes of
the skyrmions are summarized in Fig. Considering
only the ferromagnetic IEC, the horizontal positions of
the skyrmions in the two layers become locked to each
other, but their shape remains unaffected, as shown
in Fig. fifa). Including the IL-DMI, a finite angle is
opened between the spins above each other in the two

m=

layers. For two ferromagnetic layers, this angle is given
by a = arctan (jp™ 7") [35], and the magnetic mo-
ments will align in the plane perpendicular to the IL-
DMI. Here, the skyrmions in the two layers deform dif-
ferently to maximize their energy gain from the IL-DMI,
and form an object which we call twin-skyrmion. For
example, in Fig. [ifb) the IL-DMI points in the x direc-
ion, preferring a tilting between the two layers in the
yz plane. The out-of-plane polarized background in the
op layer tilts towards the positive y direction, while in
che bottom layer it tilts towards the negative y direc-
sion, as shown by the white arrows in Fig. fifb). For a
Néel-type skyrmion shown in the figure, the spins above
and below the skyrmion center point along the positive
or negative y direction, and the system gains energy by
enlarging these areas, resulting in an elongation along
che a direction and a small shift of the skyrmion cen-
ers in the two layers oppositely along the y direction.
When the IL-DMI points along the y direction instead,
he polarized background tilts towards the negative and
positive x directions in the first and second layers, and
he twin-skyrmion becomes elongated along the y direc-
ion, as shown in Fig. fife). For Bloch-type skyrmions,
he in-plane spin components are rotated by 90 degrees;
consequently, the elongation can also be observed per-
pendicular to the direction of the IL-DMI. The direction
of elongation may be generally expressed as

R=+

on the IEC J™ and IL-DMI Dl”. The parameters are J'* =
6meV, |D™| = 1.5meV, Di’ = Di’ = 0, and B* = 1.4T.

remains symmetric between the positive and negative di-
rections. If the IL-DMI points along the z direction,
it prefers a rotation in the ry plane, and, for a strong
enough magnetic field B, it does not influence the po-
arized background. However, the twin-skyrmion may
gain energy by changing the helicities in the two layers
y rotating the in-plane spin components, resulting in
a negative helicity in the first and a positive helicity in
he second layer in Fig. fifa). The area of the skyrmion
where the spins are pointing in the plane is also extended
compared to Fig. fifa) while retaining its circular shape.

The elongation of the twin-skyrmion for in-plane IL-
DMI is quantitatively analyzed in Fig We define
he twin-skyrmion radius as the distance between the
kyrmion center (O(r) = 7) to a point where the spins
ie in-plane (O(r) = 7/2), and take the ratio of the radii
along the x i y directions to obtain the elongation.
We only consider Néel-type skyrmions elongating along
he x direction for an IL-DMI along the x direction; the
results may be generalized to other directions of the IL-
DMI based on Eq. Q). Generally, R,/Ry increases with
stronger IL-DMI and decreases with stronger IEC. The
interactions inside the layer also hinder the elongation of
he skyrmion, since this represents an energy loss com-
pared to the circular shape preferred by these couplings.
For a sufficiently strong IL-DMI, around J‘ = 1meV
and D! = +1meV in Fig. |2| the elongation becomes
unbounded. This is similar to the elliptic instability of
circular isolated skyrmions [86], which may be triggered
by increasing the IF-DMI. In the conventional elliptic
instability, the IF-DMI prefers non-collinear structures,
competing with the polarizing external field; if the IF-
DMI is sufficiently strong, isolated skyrmions transform

into a stripe which eventually fills up the whole area with
a non-collinear structure. In contrast, the IL-DMI does
not lead to structures which are modulated in the plane.
However, spin spirals formed by the IF-DMI may gain
energy from the IL-DMI by introducing a phase shift be-
tween the spirals in the two layers, while the IL-DMI
competes with the out-of-plane field under all circum-
stances since the latter prefers to align all spins along
the same direction.

The influence of the out-of-plane IL-DMI on the twin-
skyrmion is shown in Fig. The change in the helic-
ity from the value preferred by the IF-DMI, which is
w = 0 in the figure, has the same magnitude but op-
posite sign in the two layers. The difference between
the helicities in the two layers w1 — we, ie., twice the
leviation from the 7% = 0 value mentioned above, is il-
lustrated in Fig. Bla). The IL-DMI is responsible for this
ifference in helicity between the layers, meaning that
the difference increases with D!“. Changing the sign of
D' is equivalent to switching the two layers, which re-
sults in a sign change in the helicity difference. The de-
pendence of 7, — Wz on D! is approximately linear, as
shown in the line cuts Fig. |3{b). Increasing the IEC de-

creases the slope of the curve, and stronger interactions
inside the layers also counteract this difference in helicity;
e.g., the IL-DMI is competing with the IF-DMI preferring
a Néel-type rotation in both layers. Since the circular
shape of the skyrmion is preserved, determining the twin-
skyrmion profile reduces to a radial differential equation
in the continuum limit, which can be solved efficiently
numerically, as presented in Supplementary Note 1. The
results of this solution compare favorably to the solution
of the LLG equation on the square lattice, as shown in
Fig. [3{b). ncreasing the IL-DMI also increases the size
of the twin-skyrmion, as shown in Fig. Ic). The size is
ne same for both signs of D!”, and appears to depend
quadratically on its magnitude, as shown in Fig. [3{d).
n contrast to the in-plane IL-DMI, the ferromagnetic
ackground does not always have a finite angle between
he layers for a finite D!“, since the background spins are
arallel to the IL-DMI in this case. For J!’ = 1 meV and
B=3T the IL-DMI D™ has to be larger than 1.15 meV
o overcome the magnetic field_and open a finite angle.
We restrict the val tl meV such
hat the background remains parallel ‘to the z direction.
We derive the formula for the threshold value of D™ in
Supplementary Note 4.

Current-driven motion

We study the current-driven dynamics of the twin-
skyrmions in the CPP geometry. For low driving cur-
rents which do not deform the skyrmion considerably,
the position of the center of mass of the skyrmions may
be treated as a collective coordinate, and internal degrees
of freedom may be neglected. In this approximation, the
velocity v and thus the motion of the skyrmion under
CPP can be described by the Thiele equation [37],

Gxvt+ad-v=F=B-P, (3)

which has been demonstrated to describe skyrmion dy-
namics with high accuracy [21]. Here, the gyrocoupling
vector G is given by G = —4rp.a~*y~!Qé., with Q
being the topological charge and a the in-plane lattice
constant. We take the continuum limit and consider a
micromagnetic framework, §; > s(r). The dissipation
tensor D is then given by,

Dw = i | i 8,s(r) - 8s(x)dr, (4)

where ju,v € {x,y}. The tensor B is given by,

Bu = Babe [f @psle)xs(0)),ae (6)

The index y runs over the two spatial dimensions ps €
{x,y} and k over the three dimensions of spin direction
k € {a,y,z}. B transforms the three-dimensional current
polarization P into the two-dimensional force F acting in
the plane of the layers.

We investigate how the velocity of the twin-skyrmion
is influenced by the direction and the strength of the
IL-DMI. The velocity is characterized by its magnitude
and direction, the latter usually expressed in terms o
che skyrmion Hall angle, which is typically defined as
che angle between the current driving the skyrmion and
che velocity. In our simulations, we fix the polarization
vector P along the x direction, which in the spin—orbi
sorque picture corresponds to an electric current j,, flow-
ing along the positive y direction. We have observed
above that the IL-DMI changes the shape and size of
che skyrmions, and its out-of-plane component induces
a difference in the helicity between the layers. The de-
ormation and helicity of the twin-skyrmion has no effect
on the topological charge Q and therefore on the gyro-
coupling vector G. The dissipation tensor 9 depends on
he size and shape of the skyrmions, but is independent
of the helicity. The tensor B depends on all of the men-
ioned parameters. For circularly symmetric skyrmions,
he latter may be expressed as a function of helicity ~
and vorticity m as PI],

B= psor ( sinw —a08 v 0) ; (6)

mcosy msinw 0

In Fig. |4| we study the effect of in-plane IL-DMI on
Néel-type skyrmions for different directions of the IL-
DMI. The current polarization along the +2 direction
means that the results for the IL-DMI pointing along the
x or y direction are no longer connected by rotation. Note
that rotating the direction of the IL-DMI and keeping the
polarization fixed is equivalent to rotating the polariza-
tion or driving current in the opposite direction for a fixed
IL-DMI, which may also be performed in a material with
fixed parameter values. The only symmetry observable
in the figure is reversing the direction of the IL-DMI: the
transformation +D'" + —D!" is the same as exchanging
the top and bottom layers, si) => 8”) a nd s > si),
which does not influence the motion since the interactions
inside a single layer are identical. Without IL-DMI, the
skyrmion Hall angle measured from the nominal current
direction along +y is around 83°, while the velocity is
13a-ns~!. If the IL-DMI is approximately parallel to
che x or y axis, the skyrmion Hall angle only minimally
varies, but the velocities may differ by up to 70% for
he same driving current and magnitude of IL-DMI. In
particular, the skyrmions move faster along the direc-
ion they are elongated due to the IL-DMI, and slower
if the direction of movement determined by the current
polarization is approximately perpendicular to the elon-
gation. Along the lines DI) = +p, a different effect
can be observed: the velocity is approximately constant,
but the skyrmion Hall angle differs considerably, taking
he value of 60° for Div = —DyP = +1meV and 107°
or. DE = DpP= = +1 meV. The angle between the move-
ment and the elongation directions is similarly low along
both of these lines, resulting in a relatively high velocity.
Overall, it can be observed that for low angles between
che direction of elongation and the current polarization,

2 x 10° time steps, i.e., 2ns.

he Hall angle of the twin-skyrmion is adjusted to roughly
follow the elongation direction while keeping a high ve-
locity, whereas for higher angles between these two direc-
ions the movement slows down and the skyrmion Hall
angle returns to its value for uncoupled layers. This en-
ables tuning the skyrmion Hall angle and the velocity
separately from each other.
The influence of the out-of-plane component of the IL-
DMI is investigated in Fig.[5| As it was shown in Fig.
his type of IL-DMI causes a difference in the helicity be-
‘ween the skyrmions in the two layers. This would induce
different velocity directions for the two parts of the twin-
skyrmion, which is expected to cause an instability. This
can also be observed in the simulations, because only
or small IL-DMI values (D!" < 0.6 meV for the chosen
rameters) is the motion of twin-skyrmions stable. It
could be expected that the velocity of the twin-skyrmion
is determined by the average of the velocity vectors in the
wo layers, thus the different velocity directions between
he layers leads to a reduction of the net velocity. On
he contrary, an increase in the velocity with D!’ may
be observed in Fig. This is caused by an increase in
he twin-skyrmion size with IL-DMI, as shown in Fig:
and[5] The force calculated from the B tensor increases
approximately linearly with skyrmion size; see Supple-
mentary Note 3 for the derivation. Since the changes in
the dissipation tensor D are small compared to B, the ve-
ocity of the twin-skyrmion correlates very closely with
the skyrmion size and the force acting on the skyrmion.
Since the dissipation tensor depends weakly on the IL-
DMI in this case, the Hall angle only increases by 0.3%
when increasing D! from 0.0 meV to 0.6 meV.

Dzyaloshinskii—Moriya interactions. We found that the
IL-DMI locks the skyrmions in the two layers to each
other but also deforms their shape, thereby stabilizing a
structure which we termed twin-skyrmion. The in-plane
IL-DMI tilts the magnetization in the collinear regions
in the two layers in opposite directions. It also causes
she skyrmions to elongate and their centers to shift op-
positely in the two layers, thereby maximizing the energy
gain from this energy term. For a sufficiently high value
of the IL-DMI, this results in an elliptic instability of
he twin-skyrmion. The out-of-plane IL-DMI preserves
he circular shape of the skyrmions in the two layers,
but increases their radius and changes their helicities in
opposite directions.

Furthermore, we studied how the IL-DMI influences
he current-driven motion of twin-skyrmions in the CPP

geometry. For in-plane IL-DMI, we found that the dy-
namics strongly depends on the relative directions of
the equilibrium elongation and the current polarization.
The twin-skyrmion prefers to move along the direction
of its elongation by increasing its velocity compared to
uncoupled skyrmions in the two layers and adjusting
its skyrmion Hall angle if the polarization direction is
changed. However, if the direction of motion preferred by
he current polarization is approximately perpendicular
o the elongation, the velocity reduces and the skyrmion
Hall angle stays close to its value for uncoupled lay-
ers. For out-of-plane IL-DMI, we observed an increase in
skyrmion velocity together with the skyrmion size, while
he skyrmion Hall angle was found to be hardly affected.

These findings could motivate experimental studies on
skyrmions in magnetic multilayers coupled by IL-DMI,
expanding upon previous works in systems coupled by
ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic IEC. The possibility
o change the skyrmion velocity or the Hall angle sep-
arately depending on the current polarization direction
should provide improved control over the current-driven
motion of skyrmions. It has been demonstrated that
skyrmions with circular equilibrium profiles become dis-
orted by even stronger driving currents [38}|40]. The dy-
namics in this strongly nonlinear regime is expected to
come even more complex in the presence of IL-DMI,
which may prefer a different direction of elongation com-
ared to the driving current and also affects the stability
of twin-skyrmions.

METHODS
Atomistic spin model

We describe the magnetic system by a classical atom-
istic spin model on two layers of a square lattice contain-
ing 128 x 128 sites on top of each other. We split the spin
Hamiltonian of our system into three parts,

H = Hy, + Ho + Hinter, (7)

where H; includes all interactions inside the first layer,
Hy the interactions in the second layer, and Hinte;, in-
cludes all interlayer interactions. Denoting a spin in a
layer with the unit vector S!, where 1 = (1), (2) is the
layer index, and assuming the same interaction parame-

ters for both layers, we can write,

Inside each layer we consider the nearest-neighbor in-
erfacial (IF) exchange interaction (J'™), the nearest-
neighbor DMI (Di; ) vector perpendicular to the bonds
between nearest neighbors preferring a Néel-type rota-
ion, and the Zeeman interaction with an external mag-
netic field B. jus is the magnetic moment at a site and
(i,j) is the sum over all sites i and their nearest neigh-
bors j. We include two interlayer couplings mediated by
a non-magnetic spacer layer separating the two magnetic
ayers: the IEC J' and the IL-DMI D"™. If not speci-
fied otherwise, we consider the parameters J’ = 6 meV,
D| = 1.5 meV, and ps = 3p, where jp is the Bohr
magneton. These values lead to the stabilization of Néel-
ype isolated metastable skyrmions in a collinear back-
ground inside a single layer for a sufficiently high external
magnetic field applied along the out-of-plane z direction,
as illustrated in Fig. fa).

Current-driven motion

To study the dynamics of the structures, we consider
the current-perpendicular-to-the-plane (CPP) geometry.
This describes the case when the multilayer is placed on a
non-magnetic substrate with strong spin-orbit coupling.
Besides the substrate being responsible for the interfa-
cial DMI, an electric current flowing inside the substrate
gives rise to a spin current flowing perpendicular to the
layers, which exerts a spin-orbit torque on the magneti-
zation [23]. This torque is included in the LLG equation

as follows [18] [43],

like torque proportional to $8, and a damping-like torque
proportional to 84. Since the field-like torque acts exactly
like an external magnetic field, it distorts the skyrmions
but does not set them into motion [21]. Therefore, we
simplify the analysis by setting 6, = 0 and only inves-
tigating the effect of the damping-like term driving the
skyrmions.

SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE 1: HELICITY
DEPENDENCE OF THE TWIN-SKYRMION ON
THE IL-DMI

To study the effect of the IL-DMI on the skyrmion he-
licity analytically, we take the continuum limit $! — s;(r)
for I € {(1), (2)}. Similarly to the atomistic Hamiltonian
Eq. (7), the continuum free-energy density can be split
into three parts,

E = €,[81(x)] + €2[82(x)] + Emnter[Si(x),82(x)]. (14)

The intralayer interactions are contained in €;[s;(x)],

Ey[si(x)] =EEX™ + EPMI 4 gZeoman
=A((Wsi)? + (Wst)’ + (Vsi)’)
+D'" (s70,.sf — s?0,87 + sfOys! — s/0,87)
—MB* sj, (15)

where we assumed that the exchange stiffness A, the
Néel-type DMI constant D, the saturation magnetization
M, and the magnetic field B* are the same for the two
layers, as in Eq. (8). The two layers are coupled in the
following way:

‘(16)

Einter

where 7 is the IEC constant and D* is the z component
of the IL-DMI vector. We assume that the other compo-
nents are zero, D® = DY = (). Under this assumption, the
Euler-Lagrange equations derived from Eq. (14) admit
circularly symmetric solutions, as has been extensively
studied in the case of a single layer [B6]. To describe
these spin textures, we use polar coordinates in space,

0x _ (cos yd, — p~' sin pd,
(3) - (oe Op + pt , (18)

cos pO,
In spin space, we transform to spherical coordinates,

st sin Q; cos ®;
s/ | =| sin@;sin® |. (19)
Sp cos 0;

Equilibrium spin structures are found as the solution of
the Euler-Lagrange equations,

dp (Bea) =567
ao(ae.ey) * a(a@,55) = oor
an Bea) =a

We use the following ansatz for circular skyrmions:

Oi(p, 2) = Or(p), (24)
®i(p, y) = muy + dip). (25)

The type of IF-DMI assumed in Eq. [15] prefers the vor-
ticity m, = 1 and the Néel-type helicity ~ = 0 ina
single layer. The IL-DMI does not change the vortic-
ity, but induces opposite fields in the two layers, and
the equilibrium conditions may be simultaneously sat-
isfied for y(p) = +(p). The same material param-
eters in the two lagers also allow for te wy
©1(p) = O2(p) = O(p). Combining Eqs. (18) and (i9),
one can rewrite Eqs. and (16) in we S ondinatee

respectively. ©’ and y are the radial derivatives 0,0(p)
and 0,v)(p). Only the difference in azimuthal angles © —

Note that for wy = w’ = 0, Eq. simplifies to the ra-
dial Euler-Lagrange equation of a single skyrmion [36].
However, this assumption does not satisfy Eq. in the
presence of an IL-DMI D*. For a fixed value of w, the in-
terlayer terms introduce an effective anisotropy term pro-
portional to sin@cos@. This prefers an in-plane align-
ment of the spins since in this case they can gain energy
from the IL-DMI, thereby it competes with the external
field and results in an increase of the skyrmion size.

FIG. 6. Skyrmion profile from the continuum model for out-

tions of Eqs. { under the boundary conditions in
Eq. (32). The black dots are obtained from the atomistic LLG
simulations. The highlighted value )(pskyr) = $(w1 — ¥2) =
0.311 shows the helicity at the skyrmion radius O(pskyr) =
m/2. The system parameters are: J” = 6mev, DY =

continuum parameters are A = 3meV/a", Dp 15 meV /a’,
B* = 3T, J'® = 1meV/a’, and D* = 1meV/a*. The con-
version between the atomistic and the continuum parameters
follows the expressions given in Ref. [46] for the intralayer
terms; the interlayer parameters are simply divided by the
atomic volume when passing to the continuum limit.

We solve Eqs.

) numerically with the

(0) = 7, O(co) = 0, w'(0) =0, and y/(co) = 0. (32)
We solve the boundary value problem using the imple-
mentation of SciPy [44], which is an adaption of the al-
gorithm presented in [45]. We compare the numerical
solution of Eqs 31) with the profile obtained
from the atomi: s via a solution of the LLG
equation in Fig. [6] The lattice and the continuum mod-
els agree well. Since the helicity ~ only depends weakly
on the radial coordinate, it may be well described by its
value at the skyrmion radius O(pskyr) = 7/2, which was
used for the comparison between different IL-DMI values
in Fig. 3 in the main text.

SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE 2: SKYRMION HALL
ANGLE AS A FUNCTION OF HELICITY

For circularly symmetric skyrmions, the Hall angle
may be calculated analytically from the Thiele equation
in Eq. (3). Using that the dissipation tensor D is a unit
tensor with magnitude D, and the dependence of the B
tensor on the helicity ~ and the vorticity m = 1 is given

10
by Eq. (6), the skyrmion velocity may be expressed as

Ve \ peor aD G siny —cos~ Px

(33)

ecause it does not contribute to the force

We omitted P,
F.

The skyrmion Hall angle Oya is defined as the angle
between the velocity and the current direction. We con-
nect the current direction to the velocity via P || je, x Z,
as is usual for the spin-orbit torque, resulting in j. ||
(-P, Pe). For a Néel-type skyrmion with w = 0, this
coincides with the direction of the force F = BP. For cir-
cularly symmetric skyrmions, we can assume P = (1 0)
without loss of generality, resulting in j, || (0 1). We
obtain the following for the direction of the skyrmion ve-

locity:
‘Das ksinw + cosy

arctan (G/aD) is the typical expression given in the lit-
erature for the skyrmion Hall angle [21 [47| [48]. This im-
plies that the two parts of the twin-skyrmion are driven
along different directions by the spin-polarized current
due to their different helicities, which results in an insta-
bility of the motion for high driving currents.

SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE 3: SKYRMION
VELOCITY AS A FUNCTION OF SKYRMION
RADIUS

Under the assumption of circularly symmetric
skyrmions for out-of-plane IL-DMI, the dependence of
the velocity on the skyrmion size may also be calculated.
To derive an analytical estimate for the parameters, we
assume a linear dependence of 0 on the radial coordinate

FIG. 7. Scaling of the force amplitude fS°T with the

skyrmion radius R. The different skyrmion sizes are gener-
ated by changing the IL-DMI D!" from 0.0 meV to 0.6 meV,
using the same values as in Fig. 5 in the main text. The blue
points are obtained by numerically integrating Eq. with
©(p) coming from the atomistic simulations.

The factor fS°T in the B tensor in Eq. (6) is given by
the integral

Therefore, the magnitude of the force scales linearly with
the size of the skyrmion.

We confirm this linear scaling by plotting the values of
fS°T obtained from simulations in Fig.

The dissipation tensor D for circular skyrmions is a
unit tensor, with its magnitude given by

a

Performing the coordinate transformation to polar coor-
dinates in real space and spherical coordinates in spin
space, one obtains,

This demonstrates that D is scale independent, i.e., it
does not depend on the skyrmion radius if the shape of
Q(p) does not change. This can also be observed in the
simulations: as Dl” increases from 0.0 meV to 0.6 meV,
the value of D numerically calculated from the atomistic
model only decreases by 3.3% from 15.3meV -s/a? to
14.8meV -s/a?, while fS°T increases by 18.4% for the
same parameters as in Fig. 5 in the main text.

SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE 4: INSTABILITY OF
THE PARALLEL MAGNETIC ALIGNMENT OF
THE TWO LAYERS IN THE PRESENCE OF D!™

For a sufficiently strong external magnetic field B,
the ground-state magnetic configuration obtained from
the Hamiltonian in Eq. (8) and (9) in the main text
is collinear in each layer, s = S!. This simplifies the
Hamiltonian to the following macrospin model:

H=—-J*8.s2) 4p™.(8 x§@)—1,.B-(SYP+8),

(47)
We assume that the IL-DMI vector and the magnetic field
point along the z direction, D'’ = D!“% and B = Ba.
Using the spherical coordinates analogously to Eq. (i9),
we can rewrite Eq. |

H =— J'"(sin? © cos(®, — 2) + cos? @)
+ D1 sin? © sin(@, — B)
— 2usB cos ©. (48)

Here, we assume that the polar angle is the same for both
spins, 9; = 02 = O, which follows from the symmetry
of the two layers. We introduce the variable 6 = 6; — ®2.
To find the spin configuration with minimal energy, we
require

— Wen 90 — oo DY
0oH = J sin 20( 1—cosd Fit sind

+2u.B sin = 0, (49)

05H = (J'™ sind — D4” cos6) sin? © = 0. (50)

Both equations are satisfied for sin = 0, i.e., when the
spins are aligned along the z direction. Solutions with
sin © ¥ 0 can be found by transforming Eq. to

IL

6 = arctan Fit (51)

Inserting Eq. into Eq. gives
2cos 9 sin O( J? 4 pile — J) =2n,Bsin®, (52)

which may be solved for © as

.B
© = arccos i _ : (53)

12

This expression can only be evaluated if the argument of It is straightforward to show that if this solution exists,
the arccos function is in [—1,1]. This condition may be it has a lower energy than the sin © = 0 solution. In this
reformulated as case, the spins deviate from the direction of the exter-
nal field since they gain more energy from the IL-DMI

by forming a finite angle in the zy plane. For the pa-

rameters J'’ = 1meV,j1s = 3m and B = 3T used as

SS an example in the main text, this transition occurs for
