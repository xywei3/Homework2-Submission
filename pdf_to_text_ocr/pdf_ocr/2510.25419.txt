ABSTRACT

The effective redshift distribution n(z) of galaxies is a critical component in the study of weak
gravitational lensing. Here, we introduce a new method for determining n(z) for weak lensing surveys
ased on high-quality redshifts and neural ne based importance weights. Additionally, we present
he first unified photometric redshift calibration of the three leading stage-III weak lensing surveys,
he Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey and the Kilo-Degree Sur-
vey (KiDS), with state-of-the-art spectroscopic data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument
(DESI). We verify our method using a new, data-driven approach and obtain n(z) constraints with
statistical uncertainties of order oz ~ 0.01 and sma.

ler. Our analysis is largely independent of previous
es an important cross-check in light of recent cos-
mological tensions. Overall, we find excellent agreement with previously published results on the DES
Y3 and HSC Y1 data sets while there are some differences on the mean redshift with respect to the
reviously published KiDS-1000 results. We attribute the latter to mismatches in photometric noise
roperties in the COSMOS field compared to the wider KiDS SOM-gold catalog. At
he new n(z) estimates for KiDS do not significantly change estimates of cosmic structure growth from
cosmic shear. Finally, we discuss how our method can be applied to future weak lensing calibrations
with DESI data.

1. INTRODUCTION

Since the first robust detection in the early 2000s (see,
e.g., Bacon et al. 2000; Kaiser et al. 2000; Van Waerbeke
et al. 2000; Wittman et al. 2000), weak gravitational
lensing by large-scale structure has become a major cos-
mological probe. By studying the shape perturbations of
the images of galaxies, we can obtain detailed measure-
ments of the growth of structure over cosmic time. In the
coming decade, experiments such as the Euclid satellite
(Euclid Collaboration et al. 2025), the Nancy Grace Ro-
man Space Telescope (Akeson et al. 2019), and the Vera
C. Rubin Observatory (The LSST Dark Energy Science

The observed weak lensing distortions of galaxy im-
ages by foreground structure depends not only on the
oreground mass distribution but also on the distance
o the lensed galaxies. As a result, translating weak
ensing measurements into constraints on cosmic struc-
ure growth requires detailed knowledge about the dis-
ance to the lensed galaxies, i.e., their cosmological red-
shifts z. Precision redshifts for individual objects can,
in principle, be obtained from spectroscopy. Unfortu-
nately, given the large number of faint objects detected
by weak lensing experiments, this approach is infeasible
or all galaxies detected. Instead, weak lensing

surveys

Collaboration et al. 2018) will image hundreds of mil-
lions of galaxies and detect weak gravitational lensing
with unprecedented statistical precision. The increasing
fidelity of these experiments puts stringent requirements
on potential systematic errors, especially the calibration
of photometric redshifts.

to the mean redshift Z of each tomographic bin

For stage-III experiments such as the Dark Energy Sur-
vey (DES; Flaugher et al. 2015; Abbott et al. 2022),
the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey (HSC; Aihara
et al. 2018; More et al. 2023), and the Kilo-Degree Sur-
vey (KiDS; Kuijken et al. 2015; Asgari et al. 2021) the
redshift distribution in each bin must be characterized
to a precision of oz/(1+ 2) ~ 0.01. For future stage-IV
experiments such as the year-10 weak lensing analysis of
the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the requirement are as
stringent as oz/(1+2Z) = 0.001 (The LSST Dark Energy
Science Collaboration et al. 2018).

Different methods for the calibration of photometric
redshifts have been developed (see Newman & Gruen
2022, and references therein). One approach is to use
high-quality, ideally spectroscopic, redshifts for a subset

(1)

—

of weak lensing galaxies to determine n(z) “directly.”
A common difficulty with this so-called direct calibra-
tion is that the sample of galaxies with high-quality red-
shifts is typically not representative of the weak lens-

ing sample. This requires additional steps to mitigate
this bias, with self-organizing maps (SOMs, Kohonen
2001) being a commonly used tool (Masters et al. 2019;
Buchs et al. 2019; Wright et al. 2020). A SOM is an
unsupervised machine-learning technique for dimension-
ality reduction. In the context of photometric redshifts,
it is typically used to map the high-dimensional color
space of galaxies into a two-dimensional representation

whereby galaxies belonging to the same or nearby SOM
cells have similar colors. This allows for the correction

of non-representative samples of galaxies by comparing
the distribution of SOM cells in the calibration sample
to the wider weak lensing sample. A second widely-used
approach is known as clustering redshifts. Most com-
monly, one uses angular cross-correlations between the

weak lensing source galaxies and samples of objects with

spectroscopic redshifts. The measured cross-correlation
is proportional to n(z)b(z), where b(z) is the large-scale
bias of the weak lensing sample. Assuming a reasonably

flexible model for b(z), one can then estimate n(z).
The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI;
Levi et al. 2013; DESI Collaboration et al. 2016a,b, 2022;
Silber et al. 2023; Miller et al. 2024; Poppett et al. 2024;
DESI Collaboration et al. 2024a,b) is a stage-IV spec-

troscopic cosmology survey using a highly multiplexed
fiber-fed spectrograph on the Mayall Telescope. DESI
is able to measure spectroscopic redshifts for around
5000 galaxies at a time (Guy et al. 2023; Schlafly et al.
2023). DESI, thus, is ideally poised to substantially
improve photometric redshift calibration via both the
direct and clustering redshift method. Recently, Rata-
jezak et al. (2025) conducted a custom evaluation of all
spectra obtained by DESI within two independent re-
gions, one that encompasses the COSMOS field, and
one that encompasses the XMM-LSS field. The targets
for DESI spectroscopy in these two areas were selected
for a broader range of analyses than the core large-scale
structure samples, and thus represent a more represen-
tative sampling of the full galaxy population than the
spectra over the full DESI footprint. At r > 16, the
surface density is 208% higher than that for the DESI
main sample for relatively red galaxies with g —r > 1,
and 250% larger for relatively blue galaxies with color
g—1r <1. The sample of extended objects in an 7 deg?
annulus centered on the COSMOS field is roughly 24%
complete down to i < 23.

In this work, we use the new DESI COSMOS-XMM
catalog (Ratajczak et al. 2025) to perform an inde-
pendent, unified photometric redshift calibration of the
three leading stage-III weak lensing surveys, DES, HSC,
and KiDS. A companion paper by Blanco et al. (in
prep.) studies in more detail the potential for DESI to
directly calibrate the KiDS data set. We show that DEST
significantly increases the number of spectroscopic red-
shifts available in the COSMOS field. At the same time,
DESI data does not fill the entire color space and misses
redshifts above z ~ 1.6. In this paper, while we use the
direct calibration method, we also introduce and verify
a new technique that is based on importance weights
instead of SOMs. Additionally, we compare our results
against the fiducial calibration results obtained from the

different weak lensing surveys. Our analysis method
is substantially different from previous work and, addi-
tionally, we use a separate new catalog of spectroscopic
redshifts from DESI, independent of the redshift com-
pilations used in previous works. Thereby, our study
addresses recent cosmological tensions from weak lens-
ing surveys, most notably the Sg-tension (see Abdalla
et al. 2022, and references therein). Finally, in a sepa-
rate study, Ruggeri et al. (in prep.), we instead perform
redshift calibrations with clustering redshifts using the
DESI large-scale structure catalogs.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly
describes the different data sets used. In section 3, we

describe our calibration method which is verified in sec-
tion 4. Our main results, estimates of the redshift dis-

the Planck Collaboration et al. (2020) analysis of cosmic
microwave background.

2. DATA

Here, we describe our data, beginning with a redshift
distribution calibration catalog of objects with high-
quality redshifts followed by a description of data spe-
cific to the three lensing surveys. In Fig. 1, we show
the footprints of the different data sets in the COSMOS
field. Notably, the DESI catalog extends far beyond the
COSMOS area for which we have deep lensing photome-
try, owing to DESI’s large 1.6-degree radius focal plane.

2.1. Calibration Data

Our calibration catalog is based on three distinct cat-
alogs: the COSMOS2020 photometric catalog (Weaver
et al. 2022), the deep photometric COSMOS catalog of
the DESI Legacy Survey DR10 (Zhou et al., in prep.),
and the spectroscopic DESI COSMOS-XMM catalog
(Ratajezak et al. 2025). The calibration catalog uses the
COSMO82020 catalog as a basis, adding in Legacy Sur-
vey and DESI information for individual objects where
available. The deep Legacy Survey catalog in COS-
MOS has 5o imaging depths of 26.4, 26.0, 25.7, and
24.9 for the griz bands. Thus, both COSMOS2020
and the Legacy Survey catalog are significantly deeper

than the weak lensing catalogs considered here. The
DESI COSMOS-XMM redshift catalogs include 307,934
unique spectra in total over the two 16 deg? fields. This
publicly available catalog includes redshift classifications
and matches to the DESI Legacy Survey DR10 (Dey
et al. 2019), HSC PDR3 (Aihara et al. 2022), and COS-
MOS2020 (Weaver et al. 2022) photometry.

From COSMOS$2020, we select all objects in the 2 deg”
COSMOS area (FLAG_COMBINED==0) with valid redshifts
(1p_type!=-9). We use the LePhare photometric red-
shifts, i.e., lp-zBEST, for galaxies and stars and lp_zq
for X-ray sources. From the DESI COSMOS-XMM
catalog, we keep all targets but consider a spectro-
scopic redshift unsuccessful if the redshift is not se-
cure (NOT QUALITY_Z) (Ratajczak et al. 2025). We as-
sociate sources in the COSMOS2020 catalog with the
DESI Legacy Survey DR10 catalog and the DESI cata-
og based on a larcsec matching radius. In case multi-

ple exposures are present in the DESI catalog within a
given matching radius, we give preference to successful
redshifts in DESI’s large-scale structure target classes,
ie., BGS, LRG, ELG, and QSO, and then other success-
ul redshifts. Ultimately, each object in our calibration
catalog will have COSMOS2020 photometry and photo-
metric redshifts, a subset has Legacy Survey photome-

ry, and an even smaller subset of that will have spectra,
and possibly redshifts, from DESI.
In our analysis, we will use a subset of that calibration

sample with the goal of extracting as much redshift in-
‘ormation from the secure DESI spectroscopic redshifts.
The basic idea is that galaxy populations with sufficient
coverage by DESI will exclusively be calibrated with
DESI redshifts. In Fig. 2, we display basic properties
of the calibration sample such as redshift and magni-
tude distributions. We also demonstrate the weighting
procedure that is described in more detail in section 3.1.

2.2. Dark Energy Survey

The year 3 data release of the Dark Energy Survey
(DES Y3) targets ~ 4000 deg” on the sky with an effec-
tive number density of 5.6 arcmin~? (Gatti et al. 2021).
Galaxies are assigned into 4 tomographic bins based on a
SOM of the 3-band riz photometry (Myles et al. 2021).
In this work, we utilize the so-called Balrog catalogs (Ev-
erett et al. 2022) in which objects from deep photometric
fields, such as COSMOS, are artificially injected into the
DES Y3 footprint, including photometric noise. The ar-

tificial injections are processed with the same pipeline
as the real data, allowing us to estimate the probability
of each galaxy in the COSMOS field to pass the DES
Y3 selection cuts and be assigned a certain tomographic
bin as well as their lensing weight. Finally, the fiducial

the 7 magnitude, the g — z colors, and fiber probability pr (right). In this figure, we limit our analysis to targets with i < 24.5.

In all cases, we show the distribution of the COSMOS$2020 parent sample as the blue line and the unweighted calibration
sample as a red line. Finally, the colored histogram represents the weighted calibration sample and is divided in different target
classes. These include targets with successful redshifts that are part of the BGS, LRG, ELG, and QSO samples (DESI-LSS),
targets with DESI redshifts from other programs (DESI-Other), targets that received fibers from DESI but did not received a
high-confidence redshift (DESI-Fail), and objects never targeted by DESI (COSMOS2020). Note that the y-axes of the middle
and right histograms are partially logarithmic, i.e., beyond 0.1 and 1.0 for the middle and right histograms, respectively.

redshift calibration is based on a combination of SOM-
based direct and clustering redshift calibration (Myles
et al. 2021) and also accounts for the effects of blending
(MacCrann et al. 2022).

2.3. Hyper Suprime-Cam

The Hyper Suprime-Cam first-year data (HSC Y1),
based on the intermediate data release Sl6a, cov-
ers 137deg? with an effective number density of ~
22arcmin~? (Mandelbaum et al. 2018). Galaxies are
assigned into 4 tomographic bins based on photomet-
ric Ephor AB redshifts from 5-band grizy photometry
(Hikage et al. 2019). For our analysis, we make use
of the $17A Wide-COSMOS catalog of the COSMOS
field that is based on observations at the depth of the
full survey, contains all objects passing the fiducial weak
lensing selections cuts, and is matched against the COS-
MOS82015 catalog (Weaver et al. 2022). In the default
HSC first-year photometric redshift calibration, targets
are weighted by the product of their lensing weights
and a SOM-based weight to partially correct for cos-
mic variance in the COSMOS field. The fiducial n(z) is
then based on the weighted histogram of COSMOS2015
multi-band photometric redshifts, i.e., no spectroscopic
redshifts were employed (Hikage et al. 2019).

2.4. Kilo-Degree Survey

The KiDS-1000 data release of the Kilo-Degree Sur-
vey covers ~ 1000 deg? with an effective number den-
sity of 6.2aremin~? (Giblin et al. 2021). A total of
5 tomographic bins are assigned based on BPZ photo-
metric redshifts from the ugriZY JH K, optical to near-
infrared bands. For our analysis, we use a photometric

catalog of the COSMOS field at a higher depth than the
main survey that has been artificially degraded to sim-
ulate the depth of the KiDS-1000 weak lensing catalog
(A. Wright, personal communication). Unlike for DES
Y3 and HSC Y1, this KiDS-1000 COSMOS catalog has
not been processed with the weak lensing pipeline. To
estimate the impact of weak lensing cuts and weights,
we also make use of the DR 4.1 photometric catalogs
in combination with the KiDS-1000 weak lensing SOM-
gold catalog, as described in section 3.2. Finally, the
fiducial photometric redshift calibration has been de-
scribed in Hildebrandt et al. (2021) and is based on a
combination of SOM and clustering redshifts.

3. METHODS

In this section, we motivate and describe our method
for photometric redshift calibration. The basic idea is to
calculate two weights for each galaxy in the COSMOS
field. The first one, a completeness weight, accounts for
the fact that our calibration set is biased with respect
to the general galaxy population. The second weight,
a lensing weight, accounts for the probability that any
galaxy in COSMOS makes the cut of a particular lens-
ing survey and its expected weighting for the purpose of
gravitational lensing studies. Finally, in this section, we
also present estimates of statistical uncertainties associ-
ated with it.

3.1. Incompleteness Correction
While the DESI COSMOS spectroscopic catalog is
extensive, not every galaxy detected photometrically
in COSMOS has been spectroscopically observed with
DESI, i.e., assigned a fiber. Furthermore, the sample
6 J. U. LANGE ET AL.

of galaxies assigned fibers by DESI is based on cuts in
photometry and, thus, is a biased subset of all galaxies
in the COSMOS field. This bias can, to some extent,
be corrected for with appropriate weighting. As a first
step, for every galaxy in the Legacy Survey catalog, we
estimate the fiber assignment probability, i.e., the prob-
ability that DESI attempted to obtain a spectroscopic
redshift. Afterward, we determine a weight based on
he fiber probability. This weight is designed to up-
weight galaxies that are unlikely to be assigned a fiber
y DESI, ie., those that are under-sampled.

In this work, we will use the following notation. The
variable F quantifies for every galaxy in the Legacy Sur-
vey whether it has been assigned a DESI fiber (F =
/True) or not (F = 0/False). Similarly, we estimate
a fiber fraction, i.e., the probability to be targeted for
DESI spectra, for every galaxy and denote it by pr
(0 < pp < 1). For objects in the COSMOS2020 cata-
og that have no association in the Legacy Survey, we
will always use F = pp = 0.

3.1.1. Fiber Assignment Probabilities

Ideally, the fiber assignment probability would be
computed from first principles if the targeting criteria
were well-defined and we had random realizations of the
fiber assignment such as for the DESI large-scale struc-
ture catalogs (Lasker et al. 2025). In practice, the DESI
COSMOS-XMM catalog contains targets from a large
heterogeneous set of secondary target programs, often
without alternative realizations of fiber assignments.

Instead, we approximate the probability pr for each
galaxy of being observed by DESI by comparing which
galaxies in the photometric Legacy Survey COSMOS
catalog were part of the spectroscopic DESI COSMOS-
XMM catalog as a function of their photometry. Specif-
ically, we employ fully connected multi-layer perceptron
neural network as implemented in the MLPClassifier
class in SCIKIT-LEARN version 1.5.2. Each network has
3 hidden layers of 128, 64, and 32 neurons, each. Fur-
thermore, we employ the ReLU activation function, an

L2 regularization of 10-4, early stopping, an optimiza-
tion tolerance of 0, a batch size of 100, and an unlimited
number of training iterations. All other hyperparame-
ters were kept at their default values in SCIKIT-LEARN.
The input values fed into the network are the sky coor-
dinates, i.e., right ascension and declination, in addition
to the g, r, i, and z total and fiber fluxes, as well as the
WISE W1 and W?2 fluxes. We did not include flux errors
as DESI targeting does not directly depend on them.
The target values for the networks are whether any ob-
ject in Legacy Survey was assigned a fiber by DESI,
ie., the variable F’. The neural network hyperparame-

ers described above were determined by optimizing the
binary cross-entropy of the predicted fiber assignment
probabilities in cross-validation analysis.

The values predicted by the trained network can be
interpreted as the fiber fraction pr given an object’s co-
ordinates and photometry. To avoid spurious overfit-
ing we employ a K-fold approach by always training
he networks on 90% of the data and calculating pr for
he remaining 10%, ie., K = 10. Finally, this process
is repeated 100 times for the whole sample such that
each individual galaxy has 100 predictions. We typi-
cally find the scatter between different neural network
predictions o,, for the same galaxy to be of order 5% or
ess. Thus, after averaging those predictions, the scat-
er is of order 0.5% or less. We note that while the
network has access to the coordinates of objects, it is
unlikely to faithfully reproduce small-scale fiber assign-
ment effects such as fiber collisions and the influence
of higher-priority targets (Lasker et al. 2025). This is
not a concern for our work since we do not study small-
scale clustering. Instead, we are mainly concerned with
having accurate mean fiber probabilities as a function
of photometry within overlap regions with weak lens-
ing surveys. Finally, we observe that the raw pr do not
reproduce the mean fiber rate ff in 5% bins of pr per-
fectly and instead show small offsets. We mitigate this
by manually adjusting the raw pr values via pp — f¢(pr)-

3.1.2. Importance Weights

Naively, simply upweighting every galaxy in the DESI
catalog by pet while disregarding galaxies not observed
should result in a fair sample of galaxies in COSMOS. In
practice, this does not work since some galaxies have a
zero or near-zero fiber probability. If the fiber probabil-
ity is zero, such targets cannot be recovered in a statisti-
cal sense even through upweighting. Furthermore, we do
not expect estimates of pr to be reliable for very small
values since the relative uncertainty will be large. Fi-
nally, galaxies with pp ~ 0 would have very high weights
w, leading to a small effective sample size Nog,

2
Nan = SO

As described below, a small effective sample size would
indicate a large statistical shot noise uncertainty in the
effective redshift distribution. For these reasons, we in-
stead use the following weighting scheme.

We = 40 if pp > pemin and not F (3)

DESI REDSHIFT CALIBRATION is

In the above equation, 0 < ppmin < 1 is a free variable.
In essence, targets with a fiber fraction above pr, min only
enter our sample if they received a fiber by DESI and,
if they do, are upweighted by p- 1 We note that this
includes galaxies that were observed spectroscopically
y DESI but did not obtain a successful, i.e., high-
confidence redshift measurement. The rationale for this
decision is that the DESI instrument is optimized for
certain galaxies, e.g., luminous red galaxies or emission-
ine galaxies, at z < 1.6 (DESI Collaboration et al.
2016a). Only using objects with high-confidence DESI
redshifts would underestimate the number of galaxies
at z 2 1.6 (Blanco et al., in prep.) and would likely
lead to biases. This is issue is not limited to DESI as

only using high-confidence spectroscopic redshifts from
other surveys can lead to biases in weak lensing cali-
rations, as well (Hartley et al. 2020). Finally, objects

with a low fiber fraction enter our calibration sample re-
gardless of whether they were observed by DESI or not,
i.e., this includes objects that only have COSMO82020
multi-band photometric redshifts. Those objects are not
upweighted. Adjusting prmin changes how much of our
sample is calibrated by DESI. Small values of pf min cor-
respond to a large fraction of the sample having DESI
spectra at the expense of larger shot noise and potential
biases. Large values pr min Will correspond to a lower

fraction of the weight coming from galaxies observed

with DESI while having a lower shot noise. In partic-
ular, pfmin = 100% corresponds to taking the entire
COSMO82020 catalog without importance weighting,
Le, we=l.

3.2. Lensing Weights

In addition to using weights to correct for incomplete-
ness in the DESI sample, we also need to apply weights
related to the weak lensing analysis. In the following, we
shall refer to a weak lensing sample b as a certain com-
bination of weak lensing catalog and tomographic bin,
e.g., the second tomographic bin of DES. Three weights
will need to be taken into account.

1. Not every galaxy in the COSMOS field is expected
to be part of a weak lensing sample b. To account
for this, we weigh every galaxy by the probability
w,(b) = p(b), the probability for each galaxy to
make the weak lensing quality cut and be assigned
the tomographic bin associated with b. This is
akin the so-called transfer function (Myles et al.
2021).

2. Galaxies in weak lensing surveys are typically as-
signed a weight w, that is designed to minimize the
variance of the measured shear. When calculating

weak lensing statistics such as cosmic shear, galax-
ies are explicitly weighted by ws. Consequently,
this weight needs to be taken into account when
calculating the effective redshift distribution n(z)
of weak lensing source galaxies.

3. The measured ellipticity eops of galaxies may have
a non-unity response to changes in the intrinsic
ellipticity ein, induced by gravitational shear, i.e.,
€obs = RX ein, with RF 1. This also affects the ef-
fective redshift distribution, essentially weighting
each galaxy by wr = R.

The total lensing weight of each galaxy with respect
to the lensing sample 0 is thus

w(b) = ur(b)(wswr)o, (4)

where (), denotes the expectation value over random
realizations of the weak lensing survey where the galaxy
ends up in sample b. In the following, we will describe
how these weights are taken into account in practice for
the different weak lensing surveys.

For every galaxy in the COSMOS field, the DES Bal-
rog catalog (Everett et al. 2022) contains a large number
of artificial injections niyj throughout the DES survey
footprint. We use these injections to estimate p(b), i.e.,
ny/Ninj, Where ny is the number of injections that fall in-
side b. Similarly, we use the Balrog catalog to estimate
(wswpR)p through a simple Monte-Carlo estimate. For
DES, the response R is estimated through the diagonal
of the response matrix, 0.5(Rii + Ree) (Huff & Man-
delbaum 2017). Unlike for DES, artificial injections of
COSMOS galaxies into the weak lensing survey footprint
do not exist for HSC. Instead, the COSMOS area has
been observed with conditions expected for the wider
HSC weak lensing survey. For every COSMOS galaxy,
we thus only have a single realization within the wider
weak lensing catalog. Thus, p(b) is 1 if the galaxy passed
the lensing cut and is assigned a certain redshift bin
and 0, otherwise. Similarly, (wswp)» becomes wswpr and
since the shear response is not available for HSC, we just
use ws. Finally, the weights for KiDS are estimated in a
similar fashion as for HSC. However, unlike for HSC, no
lensing cuts or weights have been determined for galaxies
in the COSMOS field. Thus, we learn the relation be-
tween photometry in the the raw KiDS DR4 photometric
catalog and the total lensing weight w; in the KiDS-1000
SOM-gold catalog using neural networks, i.e., with the
MLPRegressor class in SCIKIT-LEARN, a tanh activation
function, early stopping, no L2 regularization, a batch
size of 10,000, an optimization tolerance of 0 and 3 hid-
den layers of 128, 64, and 32 neurons, each.

3.3. Redshift Calibration

To obtain an estimate of the redshift distribution n(z)

of a given weak lensing sample b, we start by spatially
matching the weak lensing sample in COSMOS against
the COSMO82020-DESI calibration catalog using a 1
arcsec matching radius. We only use galaxies that are
present in both the weak lensing catalog and the calibra-
tion catalog. Since the COSMOS82020 catalog is much
deeper than the weak lensing surveys, only using a sub-
set of the weak lensing catalog present in the calibration
catalog should not result in systematic biases with re-
spect to photometry. The final weight given to each
galaxy is the product of the completeness weight in the
calibration catalog and the weak lensing weight,
Wot = We (0) . (5)
The high-quality redshift assigned to each galaxy is the
DESI redshift, if available, and the COSMOS2020 multi-
band photometric redshift, otherwise. In the end, n(z)
is estimated from a simple weighted histogram of the
high-quality redshifts.

3.4. Statistical Uncertainties

Our redshift calibration is affected by two sources of
statistical uncertainty. First, we probe the cosmolog-
ical volume in our calibration field with a finite num-
ber of galaxies, leading to shot noise (SN). Further-
more, matter and galaxies are spatially clustered. As
a result, in our calibration fields, there may be mat-
ter and galaxy overdensities at certain redshifts. This
uncertainty, which cannot be reduced by increasing the
sampling density, will be referred to as cosmic variance
(CV). We approximate both sources of uncertainty as
uncorrelated such that, for example, if we measure the
mean effective redshift Z of a weak lensing catalog, we
expect,

02 = 02 sn + FZcy- (6)

We note that our photometric redshift calibration may
also be affected by other systematic uncertainties such
as the photometric calibration in the calibration fields
as well as errors in the redshifts of galaxies in our cali-
bration sample. We will return to these systematic un-
certainties in section 6.

3.4.1. Shot Noise

We probe the cosmological volume in our calibration
field with a finite but sufficiently large sample of galax-
ies. Furthermore, galaxies in our calibration sample
have non-uniform weights wtot = w. Given the large
sample size, a good approximation to the standard er-
ror on the mean redshift is then

3.4.2. Cosmic Variance

Matter and galaxies are spatially clustered, forming
over- and underdensities on large scales. As a result,
certain redshifts may be over- or underrepresented in
our calibration sample in a way that is independent of
shot noise (Moster et al. 2011). To account for this, we
first calculate the covariance Cj; in the relative matter
overdensity between two volumes at redshifts z; and z;.
The matter variance depends on the matter correlation
function €(r,z), where r is the comoving distance be-
tween two points (Moster et al. 2011),

é ( [2,02 + (di — dj), :) ddjdd,d0.

In the above equation, d refers to the comoving distance,
dj; = 0.5(d;+d;) and f(6) is the normalized distribution
of separation angles between two random points inside
the survey footprint. The distribution f(@) can be di-
rectly estimated from the COSMOS calibration catalog
assuming that galaxies are only weakly clustered. Using
CAMB (Lewis et al. 2000; Howlett et al. 2012) version
1.5.5 to calculate the linear matter power spectrum at

different cosmic times, we can then calculate the matter
covariance between different redshifts z; and z;.
Galaxies are biased tracers of the underlying matter
field such that the galaxy covariance between z; and 2;
is Cijbibj, where b; and b; are the linear galaxy bias
parameters at z; and z;, respectively. Ultimately, one
can show that the cosmic variance term can be approx-

imated as

Note that the galaxy bias is unknown but we can reason-
ably expect b ~ 1—2. In the following, we will assume a
constant, redshift-independent galaxy bias b and express
our results in 02 gy, /b?.

4. VERIFICATION

Before determining effective redshift distributions for
the different weak lensing samples, we want to verify
that our method works reliably.

4.1. Fiber Assignment Probabilities

A key ingredient of our analysis is an accurate esti-
mate of the DESI fiber probability of galaxies in the
COSMOS field. As a first step, we perform a visual in-
spection via SOMs to verify that the results predicted by
the deep learning model are plausible. We use SOMs as
compared to, e.g., single-band magnitudes or two-band
colors, because they allow us to study fiber probabil-
ities in high-dimensional color and magnitude space.!
In Fig. 3, we show the completeness in DESI fiber as-
signment for galaxies in the DES and KiDS COSMOS
catalogs. For DES, galaxies are projected onto the deep
DES SOM (Myles et al. 2021) and KiDS galaxies are
projected onto the KiDS SOM (Wright et al. 2020).
The left-hand panel shows the actual fiber fraction in
the SOM whereas the middle panel shows the predicted
completeness. The predicted completeness in each SOM
cell is simply the average pr of all galaxies in each cell.
It is worth emphasizing that these are pure predictions.
As described in section 3.1.1, we used a K-fold approach.
As a result, the pr estimates for each galaxy are never
obtained from a model that was trained on the galaxy
itself. Overall, the network correctly predicts the trends
seen in the data. The right-hand panel, showing the
difference between data and model predictions, shows
no strong trends with color. To evaluate this agree-
ment more quantitatively, we calculate the coefficient of
determination R? for the predicted and observed fiber
fractions within each SOM cell. We find R? to be 0.816
and 0.665 for DES and KiDS, respectively. From Monte-
Carlo simulations under the assumption that the fiber
fractions are accurate and all fiber assignments are inde-
pendent of each other, we find that the expected values
are 0.813 + 0.008 and 0.691 + 0.007, respectively. The
agreement is very good for DES but the correlation is
slightly weaker than expected for KiDS. This may in-
dicate slight inaccuracies in the estimated fiber proba-

1 We also studied the grizy magnitude, color, and color-color dis-
tributions of DES/KiDS targets matched to COSMOS2020, sim-
ilar, to Fig. 2. We compared distributions with and without
importance weights and found them to be in very good agree-
ment.

bilities but, based on the tests performed in section 4.3
below, we do not think this has a substantial impact on
the inferred redshift distributions.

4.2. Impact of Fiber Fraction Threshold

The fiber fraction threshold pr.min is a key parameter
in our method that effectively determines how strongly
the redshift calibration relies on galaxies observed by
DESI as opposed to galaxies with high-quality multi-
band photometric redshifts from COSMOS2020?. In
Fig. 4, we study how changes in pp min affect the rel-
ative contribution of DESI redshifts and shot noise for
DES, HSC, and KiDS.

Top panels indicate the weighted average of galaxies
with DESI redshifts where the weight is wtot. Note that
galaxies observed by DESI that did not end up getting
a spectroscopic redshift will not be counted in this frac-
tion. As expected, for all weak lensing samples, reduc-
ing pr,min leads to an increasing fraction of galaxies with
DESI redshifts.
DES and KiDS surveys can be calibrated with a much
higher fraction of DESI galaxies than the deeper HSC
survey. Similarly, higher-redshift tomographic bins re-
ceive less contributions from galaxies with DESI red-
shifts. Bottom panels indicate the amount of shot noise
as measured by the effective sample size defined in equa-
tion (2). Unsurprisingly, lowering Pf,min, Corresponding
to using fewer galaxies with only high-quality photomet-
ric redshifts, leads to an increase in the shot noise. The

Furthermore, we see that the shallower

increase is especially strong for ppmin < 0.1.

4.3. Redshift Distribution

The main goal of this analysis is an accurate recov-
ery of the effective redshift distribution n(z) of differ-
ent photometric weak lensing samples. Most photomet-
ric redshift calibration studies employ mock data from
simulations, such as MICE (Carretero et al. 2015) and
Buzzard (DeRose et al. 2019), to help with this task,
particularly when it comes to verifying the spectroscopic
incompleteness correction. However, in this work, we ar-
gue that rigorous tests can also be performed on the data
itself. The main idea is that high-quality COSMOS2020
photometric redshifts zcg9 exist for most galaxies in the
COSMOS field. Thus, for every weak lensing catalog,
we can directly measure the zc29 redshift distribution in
the COSMOS field and test how well we can recover this
distribution from a biased subset of galaxies with high-
quality redshifts. While COSMOS82020 redshifts have a

2 A similar concept, Pphot, has been used by Speagle et al. (2019)
to study and adjust the reliance of the HSC calibration on many-
band photometric redshifts as opposed to spectroscopic redshifts.

certain scatter and catastrophic outliers around the true
(spectroscopic) redshift (Weaver et al. 2022), especially
for faint targets observed with HSC, the correlation with
the true redshift is very strong such that one should ex-
pect that biases in the recovered n(z) should show up in
n(2c20)-
In order to check for biases in n(zc29), we modify
our pipeline to always use zcgq for all galaxies, even
if a DESI redshift is available.
setting prmin = 1 corresponds to no upweighting and,
thus, gives an unbiased estimate of n(zc20). Thus, we
check whether n(zc20) changes in a statistically signifi-
cant manner as we lower pr min. Since we are primarily
interested in the mean effective redshift, the top pan-
els of Fig. 5 shows the change in the mean zc2o redshift
2020 = f 2c20n(2c20)dzc20 compared to ppmin = 1. The
lower panels of the same figure show an estimate of the
statistical uncertainty in that difference, as calculated
ia eq. (9).
Overall, we see that the shifts in the mean zc29 red-
shifts are very small, staying well below AZc29 < 0.005
as long as prp,min > 0.10. Thus, in the following we choose
Ptmin = 0.10 in our default analysis since it provides
a good compromise between accuracy, shot noise, and
a high fraction of the calibration coming from DESI
redshifts. We note that for current stage-III lensing

As discussed earlier,

<

surveys, mean redshifts should be calibrated to within
oz/(1+2) ~ 0.01. The shifts we observe stay well below
that limit and approach the precision needed for stage-
IV surveys.

Finally, we note that the test performed here is pri-
marily a test related to the recovery of intrinsic redshift
distributions from biased samples, similar to most tests
with mock catalogs (see, e.g., Wright et al. 2020; Myles
et al. 2021). It is worth reiterating that for our fidu-
cial analysis, we use COSMOS2020 redshifts which have
scatter around true redshifts and may bias our estimates
of n(z). The same is true, but to a lesser extent, for red-
shifts from DESI. Similarly, we do not estimate potential
biases in the photometric calibration in the deep fields
(see, e.g., Myles et al. 2021). We leave such investiga-
ions to future work.

5. RESULTS

In Fig. 6, we show the main result of our study: es-
imates of the effective redshift distributions for DES,
HSC, and KiDS. We also compare these results against
he published n(z) of the three weak lensing survey
(Hikage et al. 2019; Hildebrandt et al. 2021; Myles
et al. 2021). The results are plotted as n(a), where
a = (1+ z)71 is the scale factor, instead of n(z) for
visual clarity. For convenience, we also list the results

for the mean redshift in Table 1, including estimates of
shot noise and cosmic variance, as well as the difference
compared to the published results. For KiDS-1000, the
fiducial results take into account the bias as measured

from the MICE mocks (Col. 2, Table 3 in Hildebrandt
et al. 2021).

5.1. Dark Energy Survey

Overall, we find good agreement with the results from
DES (Myles et al. 2021), both in terms of the mean
and distribution of redshifts. The strongest difference in
the mean redshift occurs for the third tomographic bin,
DES-3, with AZgq = +0.017. However, the published
DES Y3 results incorporate the effects of blending (Mac-
Crann et al. 2022) as well as additional constraints from
clustering redshifts (Gatti et al. 2022). When comparing
o the DES Y3 results without these effects, the differ-
ence between our and the fiducial results reduces further
with AzZgq = [—0.010, —0.007, +0.008, —0.004] for the 4
omographic bins (see Table 2 in Myles et al. 2021).

Furthermore, for DES Y3, we can estimate whether
he redshift distribution in the overlap region with the
DESI main survey footprint, i.e., at declination 6 >
—10deg, is significantly different from the distribution
in the full DES Y3 footprint. To do so, we recompute
he lensing weights, wr, using only Balrog injections at
6 > —10deg. We find only a very small impact on the
mean redshifts for all tomographic bins, i.e., AZ < 0.01,
suggesting that using the full-footprint redshift distri-
butions in DESI galaxy-galaxy lensing studies does not
ead to significant biases in the inferred cosmology.

5.2. Hyper Suprime-Cam

The results of this work agree well with the published
HSC results. That is expected, to some extent, since
the HSC study is based on a direct calibration with
COSMOS82015 multi-band photometric redshifts. While
we also use DESI spectroscopic redshifts, the HSC re-
sults, due to the deeper depth, still rely largely on up-
dated COSMOS2020 multi-band photometric redshifts,
as shown in Fig. 6. Nonetheless, this result also demon-
strates a good agreement of SOM-based calibration and
the neural network approach described in this work.

5.3. Kilo-Degree Survey

We find more significant differences with respect to the
published KiDS-1000 results. In the first tomographic
bin, we find substantially more galaxies at high redshift.
This leads to a shift in the mean redshift whereas we find
fairly consistent results regarding the median, 0.229 vs.
0.234. Another noteworthy difference is the distribution
in the third tomographic bin where the bulk of the n(z)
is shifted towards lower redshifts while the mean red-
shift is consistent due to an extended tail towards higher
redshifts, similar to the first tomographic bin. Possible
reasons for these discrepancies are discussed in the next
section and the appendix.

6. DISCUSSION
6.1. Direct Calibration

In this paper, we have introduced a new technique for
the direct calibration of photometric redshifts in weak
lensing surveys. Whereas the fiducial studies all employ
SOMs (Hikage et al. 2019; Hildebrandt et al. 2021; Myles
et al. 2021), our method utilizes neural network regres-
sion. Despite these apparent differences, conceptually,
both methods share a number of similarities.

The deep-wide SOM approach developed in Buchs
et al. (2019) uses two sets of photometric data and asso-
ciated SOMs°. First, there are deep-photometry fields
with more color information and higher depth than the
wide weak lensing survey. These deep photometric fields
include the calibration sample with high-quality red-
shifts. One then groups objects into galaxies occupying
the same cell in the deep SOM. Within each SOM cell,
the galaxies in the calibration sample are assumed to be
representative of all galaxies, including those without
high-quality redshifts. Effectively, galaxies in the cal-

3 HSC and KiDS do not explicitly use the deep-wide SOM ap-
proach and, instead, rely on a single SOM. Such a single SOM
approach can be regarded as a special case of the deep-wide SOM
method where wide and deep SOM and associated photometry
are identical.

ibration sample are upweighted by Ngom/Neai, where
Ngom is the number of galaxies in the SOM cell and
Neal the number of galaxies in the SOM cell that also
have high-quality redshifts. The deep SOM thus serves
the purpose of alleviating selection biases in the cali-
bration sample and the similarities to the importance
weights discussed in section 3.1 should be apparent.

The deep-wide SOM approach also utilizes a SOM
of the shallower wide photometry of the entire sur-
vey. In particular, the wide-photomery color distribu-
tion of galaxies in the deep field is compared to the
wide-photomery color distribution of all galaxies. Effec-
tively, galaxies in the deep fields are assigned additional
weights such that their wide-photometry color distribu-
tion matches that of the entire survey. In principle,
this step is not strictly necessary for unbiased results
if the wide-photometry of deep field galaxies is repre-
sentative. However, this may reduce cosmic variance,
especially if colors and thereby wide-photometry photo-
metric redshifts correlate strongly with high-quality red-
shifts within a tomographic bin. One way to implement
this technique is to correct the mean redshift obtained
from high-quality redshifts z for the difference between
the mean photometric redshift of the deep fields Z, and
the entire survey using the control variates technique.
This will reduce the variance in the mean redshift by a
factor 7, i.e., 62 = no2, with

In the last transformation, we have optimistically as-
sumed that changes in the mean redshift due to cosmic
variance are, on average, perfectly reproduced by the
photometric reshifts. Even in this optimistic scenario,
we find 7 ~ 0.5 for all bins of HSC and KiDS, indicating
that the weighting by the wide SOM would not dramat-
ically increase the precision of our estimates. For this
reason, our method does not currently implement an
equivalent of weighting by the wide SOM distribution.

One complication of the SOM method is the inherent
pixelization, i.e., galaxies are uniquely associated with
individual cells or pixels in the SOM. The number of
galaxies associated with each SOM cell can be highly
variable, especially for the smaller sample of galaxies
with high-quality redshifts. However, the SOM method
requires every SOM cell to be occupied, thus necessi-
tating a trade-off between the resolution of the SOM,
ie., the number of pixels it has, and the requirement

DESI REDSHIFT CALIBRATION 15

to have at least one galaxy in each SOM cell.4 Our
method based on neural networks avoids this issue alto-
gether by not requiring any pixelization. Additionally,
we established a simple one-parameter (pr,min) method
to adjust how much the calibration relies on high-quality
photometric redshifts for galaxies insufficiently covered
by spectroscopic samples.

6.2. KiDS-1000 Results

Whereas our results for DES Y3 and HSC Y1 are
in good agreement with the fiducial results presented
in Myles et al. (2021) and Hikage et al. (2019), we
find stronger differences with the KiDS-1000 results pre-
sented in Hildebrandt et al. (2021), as indicated in Fig. 6
and Table 1.

One major difference in our analysis is the use of high-
quality photometric redshifts from the COSMOS2020
catalog to supplement spectroscopic data. Using COS-
MOS2020 redshifts is necessary since some galaxies are
severely under-represented in the DESI COSMOS-XMM
catalog. The effect of including COSMOS2015 multi-
band redshifts in the KiDS-1000 analysis was studied in
van den Busch et al. (2022) using the same methodol-
ogy as in Hildebrandt et al. (2021). It was found that a
calibration that includes COSMOS2015 redshifts leads
to higher mean redshifts even for identical SOM cells.
Since we also find higher mean redshifts on average, this
indicates that the use of COSMOS2020 redshifts may be
one of the reasons for the different results we find here.
In turn, part of this may be driven by scatter and catas-
trophic outliers in COSMOS2020 redshifts (Weaver et al.
2022).

As mentioned earlier, in principle, assigning extra
weights to galaxies in the calibration field to reproduce
the color and magnitude distribution in the entire survey
is not necessary for unbiased results. This requires that
the color distribution and depth of the calibration field
is representative of the full survey. However, for KiDS-
1000, we find that the KiDS observations in the COS-
MOS field are somewhat deeper than the wider survey.
Whereas Hildebrandt et al. (2021) implicitly make the
KiDS COSMOS catalog reproduce the color and mag-
nitude distribution in KiDS-1000 via a SOM, we did
not. This may also explain some of the differences in
our results. However, it is not clear that applying extra
weights, as was done in Hildebrandt et al. (2021), re-
solves all issues associated with non-representative pho-
tometry. In the appendix, we present a comparison of

unoccupied. However, cells were later grouped into a number of

clusters that were then treated like a single cell.

the color and magnitude distribution of galaxies in the
KiDS COSMOS catalog compared to the wider survey.

Finally, another reason for the different results may be
related to the SOM cell quality cuts that were applied
in the KiDS-1000 analysis (Hildebrandt et al. 2021).
Before performing the photometric redshift calibration,
Hildebrandt et al. (2021) defined the so-called gold se-
lection by removing galaxies for which the mean spec-
troscopic redshifts of the calibration sources differ sys-
tematically from the mean photometric redshifts in that

SOM cell.

l(z)a — (Zp)w| < max [5nMAD ((z)a — (zp)a) , 0.4]
(13)

In the above equation, the subscripts d and w denote av-
erages of the deep calibration field and the wide survey,
respectively. Also, whereas the quality cut is applied
o each SOM cell individually, the normalized median
absolute deviation on the right-hand side is taken over
all SOM cells. The goal of this quality cut is to remove
parts of the color and magnitude space for which photo-
metric redshifts are less reliable. Using the MICE mock
catalogs, Wright et al. (2020) show that this is indeed
he case and reduces the bias of the SOM direct calibra-
ion method.

These advantages notwithstanding, the quality cut
may lead to slight statistical biases. Whether any SOM
cell fulfills this quality cut is a random variable and can
be very stochastic given that one typically has O(10)
galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in each SOM cell.
A potential issue is that Hildebrandt et al. (2021) use the
same galaxies to define the quality cut and to perform
he photometric redshift calibration. In particular, by
construction, all SOM cells in the gold selection pass the
quality cut, i.e., do not show significant differences be-
ween the spectroscopic and
example, the analysis of Hildebrandt et al. (2021) finds
hat for the first tomographic bin, KiDS-1, no single
SOM cell has a mean redshift above ~ 0.6 which im-
plies that the reconstructed n(z) drops off sharply for
z 2 0.6. However, this is, to some extent, a statistical
artifact from the fact that the same sample was used to
determine the quality cuts and to
ion. If one uses galaxies not used to define the quality
cut, as was done in this work, it is possible that indi-
vidual SOM cells may have mean redshifts above ~ 0.6.
This will lead to a higher n(z) at high redshifts, as we see
in the comparison of the reconstructed n(z) for KiDS-1.
In summary, the implementation of the quality cuts in
Hildebrandt et al. (2021) may introduce subtle statis-
tical biases which may also be partially responsible for
the different results.

Figure 7. Posterior constraints on Sg and Qm from the
KiDS-1000 cosmic shear analysis of COSEBIs. In blue, we
show the fiducial results from Asgari et al. (2021), whereas
we show the updated results using the redshift distribution
derived in this work in red. We also show the Planck Collab-
oration et al. (2020) TT,TE,EE+lowE results in purple. The
two-dimensional histogram shows the 68% and 95% contain-
ment ranges and has been smoothed for visual clarity.

Despite these differences in the derived redshift distri-
butions, we do not find significant changes in the cosmo-
logical constraints from cosmic shear. In Fig. 7, we show
the posterior constraints on Qm, the matter density, and
Sg = 08\/Qm/0.3, where og is the amplitude of mat-
ter fluctuations. The results come from a re-analysis of
COSEBIs (Complete Orthogonal Sets of E/B-Integrals)
in the KiDS-1000 cosmic shear data set using the Cos-
mosSIS pipeline (Zuntz et al. 2015), as described in As-
gari et al. (2021). The only noteworthy difference is that
we use the NAUTILUS Bayesian sampler (Lange 2023) in-
stead of MULTINEST (Feroz et al. 2009) to compute the
posterior, leading to more accurate but slightly weaker
posterior constraints (Lemos et al. 2023). In Fig. 7, we
compare the fiducial results using the redshift calibra-
tion of Hildebrandt et al. (2021) with those derived from
our updated photometric redshift calibration. Note that

the original cosmic shear analysis of Asgari et al. (2021)
assumes that the redshift calibration may be biased in

the mean redshift with Gaussian priors on the offset.
Whereas the fiducial result uses priors with non-zero
offsets derived from MICE mock catalogs, as described
in Hildebrandt et al. (2021), the calibration offset pri-
ors are zero-centered for our updated analysis. Overall,

we do not find strong differences in the derived con-

straints. While the derived constraint on Sg is lower
by ~ 0.01, the change happens mostly along the Ss-
Qm-degeneracy direction and, thus, has little impact on
the tension between weak gravitational lensing and the

Planck Collaboration et al. (2020) CMB results, the so-
called Sg-tension (Abdalla et al. 2022).

6.3. DESI COSMOS-XMM

In this work, we have presented the first unified pho-
tometric redshift calibration of weak lensing data with
DESI redshifts. We find that the single DESI data set
is already competitive with respect to the entirety of
previous spectroscopic redshift data sets combined. For
example, the DES Y3 analysis by Myles et al. (2021)
utilized spectroscopic redshifts from zCOSMOS (Lilly
et al. 2009), C3R2 (Masters et al. 2019), VVDS (Le
Févre et al. 2013), and VIPERS (Scodeggio et al. 2018)
and was able to calibrate up to 47% of the weak lensing
source redshift distribution with spectroscopic redshifts.
In contrast, in this analysis for ppmin = 0.1, we are able
to calibrate 69% of DES with DESI redshifts alone. Sub-
sequent iterations of the DESI COSMOS-XMM catalogs
will likely increase this fraction further, making DESI an
ideal data set for redshift calibration. In particular, our
neural network fiber assignment probabilities allow us
o easily identify bright, easy-to-observe galaxies that
are currently undersampled in DESI COSMOS-XMM.
At the same time, DESI’s coverage is currently poor for
‘ainter source galaxies, as indicated by the much lower
spectroscopic fractions for the HSC samples. Addition-
ally, near-IR follow-up observations may be needed for
high-redshift objects for which redshifts are hard to ob-
ain within DESI’s wavelength coverage, 360 nm to 980
nm. Thus, calibrating a significant fraction of weak lens-
ing source galaxies from the Vera C. Rubin Observa-
ory down to faint magnitudes would require additional
deep observations. In the future, we plan to supplement
DESI redshifts with other spectroscopic samples such as
zCOSMOS. Finally, we want to point out that the foot-
print of the DESI COSMOS-XMM catalog extends far
yeyond the original, roughly 1 deg? COSMOS footprint
and the corresponding DES, HSC, and KiDS COSMOS
‘ootprints, as shown in Fig. 1. Thus, extending photo-
metric data to better match the DESI COSMOS-XMM
spectroscopy footprint, as is expected with the Rubin
deep drilling fields (Scolnic et al. 2018), will lead to
a substantial reduction in cosmic variance and shape
noise.

7. CONCLUSION

In this work, we have presented the first unified photo-
metric redshift calibration of the leading stage-III weak
lensing surveys: DES, HSC, and KiDS. Furthermore,
we have performed the first weak lensing source redshift
calibration with the DESI COSMOS-XMM catalogs. Fi-
nally, we also introduced a new method for direct red-
shift calibration using neural networks. This method
DESI REDSHIFT CALIBRATION 17

represents an alternative to the widely-used SOM direct:
calibration method and, among others, avoids the pix-
elization issue inherent in the latter. Our main findings
when applying this method to data are as follows:

e Our neural network approach is able to model the
complex selection function inherent in the DESI
COSMOS-XMM catalog. Additionally, we showed

hat our redshift calibration method can recover

intrinsic redshift distributions from this incom-
lete, biased sample.

e We find excellent agreement with previously pub-
ished redshift calibration results for DES Y3
(Myles et al. 2021) and HSC Y1 (Hikage et al.
2019). On the other hand, more significant dif-
ferences exists with respect to the results of the
fiducial KiDS-1000 analysis (Wright et al. 2020;
Hildebrandt et al. 2021). We speculate that this
difference may be related the use of COSMOS2020
multi-band redshifts, the peculiar photometry in
he KiDS COSMOS field, and subtle statistical bi-
ases in the use of quality cuts.

e Our results have a high statistical precision with
oz < 0.01 for most samples. Additionally, the
DESI sample covers a large fraction of the color
and magnitude space, allowing use to calibrate the
majority of the DES and KiDS weak lensing sam-
ple with DESI spectroscopic redshifts alone.

Our analysis method and data are also readily applicable
to other weak lensing data sets such as the weak lens-
ing catalogs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS;
Mandelbaum et al. 2005, 2013) or the Dark Energy Cam-
era Legacy Survey (DECaLS; Yao et al. 2023). Most
importantly, we find that DESI is an excellent instru-
ment for the photometric redshift calibration of future
data sets such as the weak lensing catalog from the Vera
C. Rubin Observatory. To fully achieve this potential,
we also showed that larger-area deep fields matching the
DESI focal plane footprint are needed.

Recent cosmological tensions such as the Sg-tension
(Abdalla et al. 2022) between cosmic microwave back-
ground observations and weak lensing measurements
sensitively depend on redshift calibration. For the cur-
rent stage-III surveys, our analysis suggests that redshift
calibration is robust enough as to not strongly affect cos-
mology results. In the future, DESI may play a crucial
role in achieving the stringent calibration requirements
of stage-IV weak lensing surveys.

Figure 8. The effective number of galaxies in each SOM cell for the full KiDS SOM-gold sample (left), the transfer catalog
used in this work (middle), and the transfer catalog used in Hildebrandt et al. (2021). The values are normalized such that
the average number over all SOM cells is 1 in all cases. Neither transfer catalog faithfully reproduces all features of the KiDS
SOM-gold catalog.

APPENDIX

Our analysis method inherently assumes that the properties of galaxies, in the deep fields, including their measured
photometry, are representative of the wider weak lensing survey. However, this may not be the case for KiDS-1000.
One reason for this is that the KiDS pointings have a range of depths in the wgri bands and the COSMOS pointing
may not perfectly representative of the mean. For example, while the r-band depth of COSMOS pointing is within the
range of KiDS-1000 pointings, it is deeper than the average. On the other hand, the ZY JHK, bands were actually
observed at higher depth but artificially downgraded by adding gaussian noise. Ultimately, for KiDS-1000, we find
statistically significant differences in the color and magnitude distribution of KiDS observations in COSMOS deep field
compared to KiDS-1000.

Fig. 8 shows the color distribution of galaxies in the KiDS SOM, weighted by the lensing weight w;. We compare the
results from KiDS-1000 against our COSMOS catalog using the weights derived from neural networks and the fiducial
KiDS COSMOS catalog using weights derived from nearest-neighbor matching (Hildebrandt et al. 2021). While the
KiDS COSMOS catalog reproduce many salient features in the SOM map, clear differences also emerge, regardless
of the assumed weight in KiDS COSMOS. For example, one can see that the distribution of galaxies in the KiDS
COSMOS catalog reaches to fainter r-band magnitudes than the KiDS-1000 gold catalog.

This is further investigated in Fig. 9, where we show the corresponding r vs. r—Z color and magnitude distributions.
The KiDS COSMOS catalog using nearest-neighbor weights clearly shows substantial differences to KiDS-1000. The
main reason is that these weights do not account for the probability w;(s) that a galaxy makes the KiDS-1000 weak
lensing cuts. However, even for the neural network weights that account for w;(s), the KIDS COSMOS catalog extends
to deeper magnitudes and shows redder colors than KiDS-1000. We observe similar color and magnitude trends in
the raw catalogs, i.e., before applying lensing weights, indicating that this is not due to our approximate method
for creating KiDS-1000-like lensing weights. All of this indicates that the KiDS COSMOS catalog is not perfectly
representative of the KiDS-1000 data set and may lead to biases in the estimated redshift distribution.

Figure 9. Weighted distribution of r magnitudes and r — Z colors of galaxies in the KiDS SOM-gold sample (grey) compared
to the KiDS COSMOS catalog used in this work (red) and the fiducial KiDS COSMOS catalog (blue). We show 99%, 95%, and
68% ranges. The densities have been smoothed with a Gaussian kernel with a width of 0.2 mag for visual clarity.
