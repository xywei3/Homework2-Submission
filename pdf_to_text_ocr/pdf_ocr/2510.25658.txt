The GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) formalism is a well-established approach for calculating
excitation energies and optical spectra of molecules, nanostructures, and crystalline materials. We implement
GW-BSE in the CP2K code and validate the implementation for a standard organic molecular test set, obtaining
excellent agreement with reference data, with a mean absolute error in excitation energies below 3 meV. We
then study optical spectra of nanographenes of increasing length, showing excellent agreement with experiment.
We further compute the size of the excitation of the lowest optically active excitation which converges to about
7.6 A with increasing length. Comparison with time-dependent density functional theory using functionals of
varying exact-exchange fraction shows that none reproduce both the size of the excitation and optical spectra of
GW-BSE, underscoring the need for many-body methods for accurate description of electronic excitations in

nanostructures.

I. Introduction

When light interacts with a semiconductor, it can promote
an electron to the conduction band, leaving behind a hole in the
valence band. The electron and hole attract each other through
the Coulomb interaction and can form a bound pair known as
an exciton [1-10]. A correct description of such a bound state
requires including the screened Coulomb interaction between
the electron and the hole. Time-dependent density functional
theory (TDDFT) with local or semi-local exchange-correlation
functionals is widely used to compute excitation energies, but
in these approximations the long-range electron-hole attrac-
tion via Coulomb interaction is absent, and bound excitons
are not described [1-3]. Hybrid functionals include a frac-
tion of nonlocal Hartree-Fock exact exchange, which partially
restores the bare Coulomb interaction between the electron
and hole. For example, a hybrid with 25% exact exchange
corresponds, in a simple picture, to an effective static dielectric
screening of about four. While hybrids can improve agreement
with experiment, their accuracy depends sensitively on the cho-
sen exact-exchange fraction and they are significantly more
computationally expensive than local or semi-local functionals.

An alternative approach is the GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equa-
tion (GW-BSE) [2, 3, 11-13], which explicitly includes the
screened Coulomb attraction between an excited electron and
the hole it leaves behind. The GW-BSE framework has be-
come a standard in condensed matter physics for comput-
ing optical spectra of semiconductors [2, 3, 11-25], and is
also used in chemistry for accurate calculations of molecu-
lar excitation energies [26-43], where a relation to the estab-
lished wavefunction-based approaches has been shown [44—
48]. In the intermediate regime of nanoscale materials, such
as moiré superlattices in twisted van der Waals crystals or
nanographenes with sizes of a few nanometers, GW-BSE pro-
vides direct access to both the excitation energies and the
spatial structure of the electron-hole pair [7]. For example, in

* maximilian.graml @ physik.uni-regensburg.de

layered materials, electron and hole can separate over different
layers [4] ("interlayer exciton”), or can be located within a
single layer (intralayer exciton’) [7], where hybrid states [6]
as well as the switching between distinct intra-/interlayer char-
acter have been observed experimentally [5, 8-10]. The spatial
structure of the electron-hole pairs determines their excita-
tion energy and the spatial structure is thus linked to the peak
position in optical spectra.

In principle, the spatial properties of an excited state can
be obtained directly from its wavefunction w (r,, r,), which
depends on the electron coordinate r, and the hole coordinate
r,. A common way to visualize w (r,, r;,) is to fix one coordi-
nate and plot the probability density of the other, for example
wr, re for a chosen hole position rj, [7]. The result de-
pends on the choice of r;,, and important features may be over-
looked if the chosen reference position is not representative. As
an alternative, following the ideas of Frenkel [49, 50] and Wan-
nier [51] in distinguishing between different types of excitons,
one can characterize the excited state by expectation values of
the electron-hole separation, the electron position, and the hole
position. These spatial descriptors have been introduced in
quantum chemistry to study electronic excitations in molecules
and polymer chains [52-61]. The same expectation values can
be evaluated as functions of time, providing a direct and com-
pact description of the spatio-temporal evolution of an excited
state. Such time-dependent descriptors can be computed using
time-dependent GW-BSE [62-67] or real-time TDDFT [1, 68-
73). Beyond the time evolution of electronic states, recent
advances in force calculations within GW-BSE [74-77] en-
able the description of coupled electronic and nuclear motion.
Recent experimental advances enable tracking of such excited-
state dynamics with simultaneous femtosecond temporal and
sub-nanometer spatial resolution [8, 9, 78-82], allowing direct
comparison between measured quantities such as the time-
dependent exciton radius and their theoretical predictions.

The values of spatial descriptors for excited states, such
as the size of the excitation, depend on the method used to
compute the excitation, for example TDDFT or GW-BSE. The
aim of this work is to assess how the choice of the excited-state
method influences these descriptors in finite nanostructures. To

this end, we implement the GW-BSE formalism in the CP2K
software [83-85], enabling the study of both optical excitations
and their spatial extent in nanostructures.

We first present the theory of the GW-BSE framework in
Sec. II. GW-BSE calculations on nanographenes are presented
in Sec. III, where we analyze the convergence of the optical
absorption spectrum with increasing size and compare the
computed absorption spectrum to experimental data. In Sec. IV,
we introduce the theory of spatial descriptors and we apply
these to nanographenes in Sec. V, including a comparison to
TDDFT.

II. Optical absorption spectrum from GW-BSE

The GW-BSE formalism provides an accurate description
of neutral excitations by explicitly accounting for the electron-
hole interaction on top of a quasiparticle picture [2, 3, 11—
13]. Starting from Kohn-Sham (KS) density functional theory
(DFT), we first obtain the ground-state electronic structure,
which provides a convenient single-particle basis {y,(r)} for
many-body perturbation theory. The KS energies ahs and
orbitals y,(r) are determined by solving

[ho(r) + vse) p(@) = ep Wp), (1)

where /io(r) contains the kinetic energy, the external potential,
and the Hartree potential, and v,.(r) is the exchange-correlation
potential. In our implementation, the KS orbitals are expanded
in Gaussian basis functions {¢,(r)} as

Uplt) = >) Crh), 2)

with molecular orbital indices p, g, r, s, atomic orbital indices v,
and we can explicitly separate KS states yp into Noce occupied
states Wj, W; and Nempty unoccupied states Ya, Wp.

These KS states serve as the starting point for the GW cal-
culation (cf. Fig. 1), in which the poles of the single-particle
Green’s function G can be interpreted as quasiparticle energies,
effectively improving the KS energies ee. In practice, we
apply a simplification of Hedin’s equations [86], which leads
to a self-energy of the form

LOM (r,12,1) = IG, Wr}, P, 1). (3)

Hence, this simplification is called the GW approximation,
where W denotes the dynamically screened Coulomb interac-
tion. For further details on the GW approximation, we refer to
Refs. [87, 88].

Motivated by the discussion in Refs. [89, 90], we solve the
GW approximation by performing eigenvalue-selfconsistency
in G, ie. evGWo, as depicted in the central part of Fig. 1.
There, the KS energies e}* and KS orbitals y/)(r) enter the
non-interacting Green’s function [91][92]

interaction Wo is computed beforehand as [91]

Wo(r1, 82, iw) = f Celene iors), — (5)

where the dynamical dielectric function €(r,r’, iw) is com-
puted at the RPA level from the KS energies e4$ and u(r, 12) =
1/|r, — r2| is the bare Coulomb interaction. Formally, Eq. (5)
can be rewritten using a Green’s function [87], as depicted for
Go in Fig. 1.

Combining Eqs. (4) and (5) with Eq. (3), we can compute
the quasiparticle energies from

GM KS GWo ( evGW

With the solution of this non-linear equation, we recompute
the Green’s function (4) by replacing es with eon [93]:

We repeat this procedure until convergence in £5" is reached,
as depicted by the triangle in the evGWo-box in Fig. 1.

While the poles of the single-particle Green’s function pro-
vide the (formally) correct quasiparticle energies, optical (two-
particle) excitations need an extended framework, which in-
cludes two-particle Green’s function. This can be done by
reintroducing the previously neglected vertex corrections [2]
in Hedin’s equations [86], which eventually leads to the BSE
for the four-point polarizability [2, 11, 12]. In App. A, we
derive how the solution of this rather complicated form of the
BSE can be transformed to the following generalized eigen-
value problem in the product space of occupied and unoccupied
orbitals, which is then typically solved to describe optical exci-
tations [2, 12, 13, 28, 29, 31, 38, 39]:

where Q” denotes the energy of excitation n and X” and Y”

The sign corresponds to positive and negative excitation en-
ergies Q”, respectively, as the solutions of Eq. (8) come in
pairs of (CQ, X,Y) and (-Q”, YX) [1, 94-96, 99]
with excitation index n = 1,...,NoccNempty. We choose xn
and yy to be real-valued for the finite structures under study.

we employ BSE@evGW) @PBE. A KS—DFT calculation provides the

This yields the evGWo quasiparticle energies ra [Eq. (6)]. BSE

statically screened Coulomb interaction Wo(w = 0). Diagonalizing
Eq. (8) gives the excitation energies Q”), the absorption spectrum

are matrix elements of the bare and the statically RPA-screened
Coulomb interaction, respectively. The prefactor a depends
on the spin configuration and is a) = 2 for a singlet excited
state and a = 0 for a triplet excited state (cf. App. A).

In practice, we compute the matrix elements of
Eqs. (11)/(12) using the resolution-of-the-identity (RI) tech-
nique [34, 39], where auxiliary RI basis functions yp (indexed

by P, Q, R) are introduced:

and the Lpg are obtained from a Cholesky decomposition of
the Coulomb matrix

R

Note that for the Gaussian basis (2) employed in this work,
analytical expressions for two- and three-center Coulomb in-
tegrals (16), (17) guarantee efficient computations [93, 101,
102].

When solving Eq. (8) in practice, we assume that A-B
is positive definite, which allows us to recast Eq. (8) into a
hermitian eigenvalue problem with half the size. We skip the
details of this procedure and refer instead to the existing litera-
ture [1, 20, 28, 96-98, 103-106]. By neglecting the coupling
blocks B, Eq. (8) can be simplified even further, which is called
the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) [14]:

AX, = OND, tba. (18)
Computationally, both approaches are demanding in memory
(OWNoocNempty)) and in the number of floating point operations
for solving the eigenvalue problem (O(NoccNempty))-

Correspondingly, in order to enable the solution of Eq. (8)
for large-scale systems, we adopt the standard procedure and
reduce the associated prefactors by truncating the considered
number of orbitals in Eq. (8) by an energy cutoff [39]. In
App. B, we discuss the details of this technique and to which
extent it affects the accuracy of the optical absorption spectrum
and spatial properties of the excitations.

One focus of this work is to study the optical absorption spec-
tra of finite nanostructures from GW-BSE. Optical absorption
in the linear-response regime is described by the dynamical
dipole polarizability tensor a,,(w), which relates the induced
electronic dipole polarization of the nanostructure P,,(w) to an
incident electric field E,,(w) of frequency w [1]:

Pw) = D7 dy) E(w), aa! EL ysz} (19)
=

In the BSE framework, @,,,(w) can be computed from the
solution (Q”, X™, Y) of Eq. (8) for a) = 2 [1, 29, 31, 95]
(a derivation is also shown in App. A):

For the study of randomly oriented molecules in gases and
liquids, the isotropic average @(w), the oscillator strengths f”
and the photoabsorption cross section o,,(w) are typically
used, which we discuss in App. C. In periodic crystals, the op-
tical absorption is typically computed from the imaginary part
of the (macroscopic) dielectric function e(w) [2, 12, 107, 108]
related to the current-current correlation function [12, 109]. In
this work, we employ @,,,(w) for computing optical absorption
of finite nanostructures, because of its structural similarity and
relation to the dielectric function e(w) [11, 108, 110], which
is extracted from experimental data (cf. Sec. II). Equiva-
lently, one could include a factor of w in the compared ex-
pressions, which would then be the absorption coefficient
Kabs & We(w) [11], and the photoabsorption cross section
Ty (W) & Wy (@).

To demonstrate the numerical precision of our GW-BSE im-
plementation in CP2K, we benchmark the excitation energies
Q” from Eq. (8) on Thiel’s set [111], a standard set of organic
molecules. As reference implementation, we employ the GW-
BSE implementation in FHI-aims [39, 112-114]. We do not en-
force identical quasiparticle energies as starting points, but both
implementations are run from scratch as BSE@evGWp @ PBE
calculation with the aug-cc-pVDZ [115, 116] basis set. The
computational details are given in App. D.

In Fig. 2, we report the absolute error 12 - OD aial for
each molecule of Thiel’s set and the first ten excitation levels
n=1,...,Nexc, Nexc = 10, between CP2K and FHI-aims. The
presented mean absolute error (MAE) is computed as

where the index M runs over the 28 molecules in the set and

our implementation and the FHI-aims implementation [39],
respectively. We observe a small MAE of 2.7 meV in Fig. 2
with single outliers leading to a maximum error of 30 meV. In
general, the observed deviations between CP2K and FHI-aims
can be traced back to the quasiparticle energies e°’°" around

the HOMO-LUMO gap.

Ill. Absorption spectrum of nanographenes
from BSE and comparison to experiment

We now focus on optical excitations of rectangular
nanographenes with seven carbon atoms in zigzag direction
and an increasing number of repeating anthracene units, L, in
armchair direction, as displayed in Fig. 3(a). Experimentally,

details are described in App. D.

the investigation of excitation spectra of such nanographenes
is enabled by synthesizing them on noble metal surfaces [117-
119].

Since finite nanographenes feature spin-polarized zig-zag
dge states when passivated by single hydrogen atoms [120],
e introduce a second H atom at the outermost central C atoms
long the x-direction, suppressing the edge states. We compute
ptical properties from evGWo+BSE employing Eq. (8) when
increasing the repeating units in armchair direction. In Fig. 3,
we show the imaginary part of the dynamical dipole polariz-
ability tensor a, from Eq. (20) for three different number of
repeating units L = 5,10, 13. For all lengths L in Fig. 3, we
observe that the sum @um(w) is dominated by the longitudi-
nal @,,(w) component. While the a,,.(w) component shows
a strong dependence on the system length L, we can confirm
from Fig. 3(b-d) that the optical response in the transverse
direction a,,(w) remains largely unaffected by the length L in
x-direction, as it has also been observed in Ref. [121] from
semiempirical calculations.

The nanographene studied in Ref. [118] is about 20 nm long,
which corresponds to L = 46 and is beyond the system sizes ac-
cessible to our current BSE implementation. To compare with
the experimental optical absorption spectrum of Ref. [118], we

extrapolate the resulting Q”(L) to the experimental geom-
etry. The data points used for this procedure are shown in
Fig. 4. We omit L < 3 because the corresponding spectra do
not yet exhibit two well-separated low-energy peaks that would
yield reliable peak positions. For the extrapolation, we apply a
quadratic fit Q”(L) = a”) + b” /L +c” /L? motivated by the
free-electron model in a one-dimensional box with periodic
potential, as it has been already applied to other z-electron
systems [122, 123]. Taking into account the finite size of the
experimental geometries (green vertical line in Fig. 4), which
they estimate to be LO?) ~ 20 nm (cf. supporting infor-
mation of Ref. [118]), we obtain BSE excitation energies of
QP=D(LOP)) = 2.09 eV and QP-?)(LEP)) = 2.26 eV from
the extrapolation. These values are in excellent agreement with
the experimental excitation energies [118] ae? = 2.05 eV
and a = 2.31 eV, yet another demonstration of the success
of the BSE formalism.

Beyond the agreement of the peak positions, we compare the
peak heights of the GW-BSE and experimental optical absorp-
tion spectra. Ref. [118] obtains the dielectric function €,(w)
of the nanographene (20 nm length) experimentally via re-
flectance difference measurements, whose imaginary part is
shown in Fig. 5(a) (see details in App. F). In the limit of

a infinitely long nanographene, the dielectric function is re-
lated to the dynamical dipole polarizability via a frequency-
independent factor [110]:

Im e,(w) = C Ima,,(w), (24)

which has the same form as the Clausius-Mossotti relation
when neglecting local field effects [108]. Hence, we plot the
imaginary part of the dynamical dipole polarizability Im @,,(w)
in Fig. 5(b) for the nanographene with L = 13 (6nm length).
Comparing the experimental and BSE absorption spectrum
in Fig. 5(a) and (b), we observe a nice match of the overall
lineshape. The observable difference between experiment and
BSE spectrum, particularly the resonance frequencies Q”,
may originate from the different lengths in the experimental
and GW-BSE geometries (20 nm versus 6 nm). When extrapo-
lating BSE excitation energies to 20 nm length, the agreement
between BSE and experiment is excellent, cf. Table I.

IV. Spatial descriptors of electronic excitations
within the BSE

Beyond the optical response, excited states have an asso-
ciated spatial structure, which can be of interest to better un-

derstand oscillator strengths or transition rates in excited-state
dynamics. To enable a quantitative analysis of these spatial
properties, we discuss expectation values (descriptors) associ-
ated with particular spatial properties of an excitation in this
section, as proposed in Refs. [55, 56, 59].

The starting point is the wave function of the electronic
excitation [59],

POU re En) = fen 2 Pry @o (tn, Fa, -..)On(FesP2,--+)s
(25)

where ®p and ®, are the ground and an excited state wave
function of the full many-body Hamiltonian. Within GW-BSE,
Eq. (25) can be expressed in the product space of occupied and
unoccupied KS orbitals as [12, 31, 56]

Wes Fn) =D) Xf WaPeWiEn) + YP Witedaltn). (26)

ia

The physics behind Eq. (26) can be understood in terms of
electrons and holes: Concerning the first part, an electron is
excited to a (formerly) unoccupied orbital w,(r-) and leaves a
hole behind at the occupied orbital w;(1;,), where the excitation
ncan mix different KS orbitals as described by the transition
amplitudes xe). Vice versa, the amplitudes re describe the
reverse process, i.e. deexcitations [124].

The expectation value associated with excitation (26) for a
generic operator O then reads

any — (PRONE.
(Org = St

i (27)
(ee

From here on, we drop the excitation index n to simplify the
notation of the expectation values. Specifically, we focus on
the size of the excitation [59]

dexe = V(We — Til exe + (28)

which can be divided into the following contributions:

dexe =

a, + oF +02 -— 20,0 Ren. (29)
The first contribution is the distance of electron and hole
deh = Pe = Fn)exel » (30)

which naturally quantifies the charge-transfer character of an
excitation. The electron-hole separation d,_,,, is large for a so-
called a charge-transfer excitation [56, 59] where the electron
at (Ie)exc is located on a different part of the molecule [36, 52,
125-127] or of a van-der-Waals crystal [7, 128, 129] than the
hole at (Tj )exc. Further contributions to Eq. (29) are the size of
the electron

Ce= Ve — {ae ees GB)
analogously the size of the hole, a}, and the electron-hole
correlation coefficient R.;

Ren = —— (th Fedoxe = (tiexe “(tedexe) » G2)
eh

If R.;, is nonzero, it allows us to distinguish between bound
electron-hole-pairs (R., > 0) and pairs, which are avoiding
each other dynamically (R., < 0). Consequently, R., = 0
indicates uncorrelated electron and holes. By the Cauchy-
Schwarz inequality, we find that R., € [-1, 1], ie. maximal
anti-/correlation is indicated by —1/+1, respectively.

To describe the strongly anisotropic nanographenes, we ad-
ditionally define directional exciton descriptors, where the
coordinates of electron and hole are projected into the carte-

V. Size of excitations in nanographenes from
BSE and TDDFT

In this section, we analyze spatial characteristics of the
electronic excitations in the nanographenes of Sec. III, focusing
on the lowest-energy bright state (p = 1) for each length L. The
size of the excitation Ader) is shown in Fig. 6(a) as a function
of the nanographene length. For small L € [1,4], we observe
a linear increase, which saturates for larger system sizes to
~7.6 A for a length of 4 nm. The plateau indicates that the
size of the excitation is controlled by an intrinsic correlation
length (exciton radius) that is smaller than the nanographene
length, consistent with bound excitons in crystals. In contrast,
the individual spreads of electron and hole, oe) and oe),
increase with L [Fig. 6(b)], as expected for single-particle
densities in a one-dimensional box, which extend over the
system whereas the relative separation of electron and hole is
bounded via the screened Coulomb interaction. The correlation
coefficient in Fig. 6(c) confirms this view: it increases with L

and approaches one, indicating strongly correlated electron-
hole motion for large L.

In order to assess to which extent a simpler framework
can reproduce these excitonic characteristics, we next turn
to TDDFT [1], which offers a computationally cheaper alter-
native to the GW-BSE approach. Beyond that, it is available
in most electronic-structure codes, making it attractive for sys-
tematic studies of large nanographenes. However, results from
TDDFT computations depend strongly on the employed ex-
change-—correlation functional, which implicitly determines
the electron-hole interaction [58]. In semilocal exchange-
correlation kernels in the generalized gradient approximation
(GGA), this interaction is absent, while hybrid and range-
separated hybrid functionals reintroduce parts of the bare
Coulomb attraction through exact exchange. For example,
PBEO includes 25% of the unscreened interaction, whereas
HSE06 restricts it to short range, effectively mimicking a fully
screened Coulomb potential in the long range.

Figure 7 compares excitation energies and sizes of the excita-
tion obtained from TDDFT with those from GW-BSE. In panel
(a), all methods show the expected redshift of the first bright
excitation with increasing nanographene length, but the abso-
lute values differ. GGAs (PBE [131], BLYP [132, 133]) sub-
stantially underestimate the excitation energies, while hybrids
(PBEO, B3LYP [132, 134, 135], HSEO6 [136, 137]) yield val-
ues closer to GW-BSE. The exception is CAM-B3LYP [138],

overestimating the BSE excitation energy by ~ 0.5 eV, which
we attribute to the large long-range exact-exchange fraction of
65 %, binding the exciton too strongly. Panel (b) shows the
corresponding sizes of the excitation age), GGAs predict
overly delocalized excitations whose size grow linearly with L,
which we attribute to the absent attractive Coulomb interaction
between electron and hole. Hybrid functionals confine the ex-
citation more strongly, although HSE06 still shows an increase
of the size of the excitation with nanographene length since
the Coulomb interaction of electron and hole is only present
in short range. Overall, our TDDFT calculations reproduce
qualitative trends of the BSE only when the functional contains
sufficient long-range electron-hole attraction, but its quantita-
tive accuracy remains limited by the absence or approximate
treatment of screening.

Fig. 7 establishes which hybrid functionals yield a reason-
able excitation energy and corresponding size of the lowest
bright excitation; however, their ability to reproduce the over-
all spectral shape has not yet been assessed. To assess how
well TDDFT reproduces the full optical spectra beyond the
lowest excitation, we now compare the absorption spectra from
TDDFT and GW-BSE in Fig. 8. For the nanographene with

Eq. (20). Dashed lines denote the contribution of individual excita-
tions n to Im a,,(@ = Q) from Eq. (20) (cf. Eq. (F3)).

L = 13, the TDDFT spectra obtained with PBEO and B3LYP
differ significantly from the GW-BSE reference (Fig. 8): the
number and relative intensity of peaks are inconsistent, and
additional side peaks appear both at lower and higher ener-
gies. Assuming GW-BSE as the reference, these discrepancies
indicate that the TDDFT excitation spectrum is qualitatively
incorrect, which we attribute to the incorrect interaction of
electron and hole in our TDDFT calculations. Recently ad-
vances for range-separated hybrid functionals [139, 140] might
be able to mimic the screened interaction more accurately, but
their application is beyond the scope of this work. In any case,
the large experimental linewidths (cf. Fig. 5) would likely
wash out these differences even for standard functionals, such
that the broadened TDDFT spectra could still appear com-
patible with experiment despite the incorrect underlying peak
structure.

VI. Conclusion

We have implemented and applied the GW-BSE formalism
in CP2K to rectangular nanographenes with a fixed width of
seven carbon atoms along the armchair direction and variable
length along the zigzag direction. The BSE@evGW) @PBE
approach reproduces the measured absorption spectrum, and
the two lowest bright excitations agree with experiment within
0.05 eV after finite-size extrapolation. The size of the excita-
tion of the first bright state converges to about 7.6 A, establish-
ing a bound exciton with a well-defined spatial extent. TDDFT
with PBEO and B3LYP reproduces this size of the excitation
and yields reasonable lowest excitation energies, but the spec-
tra around the lowest bright peaks display additional sidebands
and altered intensities that are absent in GW-BSE. Thus, while
selected descriptors can be matched within TDDFT, GW-BSE
provides a consistent description of both spectral and spatial
properties for nanographenes.

A. Derivation of the dynamical dipole polariz-
ability and the defining matrix equation

In Eq. (20), we have introduced the tensor elements of the
dynamical dipole polarizability [1, 29, 31]

where (2, x®, y®) are solutions of Eq. (8).
In the following, we derive the form of @,,(@) as well as the
defining matrix equation in Eq. (8). We start from the general

definition of the dynamical dipole polarizability [1, 2, 100]

Qyi (@) = fered r nace ro), (A2)
where we have introduced the reducible polarizability
X(r,r’,w). In TDDFT, one can directly use the y to arrive
at Eq. (A1) [1]. However, within the BSE framework (and
similar frameworks like, e.g., TDHF [95]), the retarded four-
point polarizability L(1, 2,3, 4) is needed, which relates to the
two-point y in time-domain via y(1, 2) = L(1, 1*, 2,2). We de-
note combined space-spin-time coordinates as 1 = {r), 51,1}
and, in the following, combined space-spin coordinates as
1 = {r,, s;}. Further, we follow the convention of the main text

regarding indexing, such that p, qg,r, s denote a generic KS or-
bital, whereas i, j denote occupied, i.e. i, 7 € [1, Nocc], and a, b
denote unoccupied orbitals, i.e. a,b € [Noce + 1, Noce + Nempty]-

Changing to frequency domain, we find the Bethe-Salpeter
equation for the four-point polarizability [2, 11-13, 100]

L(, 2,3, 4; w) = L°(1, 2,3, 4; w)

+ [ 465.6,7,8)£90,2,5,6.0)

K(5, 6,7, 8) L(7, 8,3,4;w). (A3)
with the non-interacting four-point polarizability
L°(1,2, 3,4;w) and the BSE kernel K(5,6,7,8). In the

GW approximation (cf. Eq. (3)) and neglecting dynamical
screening, i.e. W(w = 0), the kernel reads [36, 38, 100]

K(1,2,3,4) = v(1, 3)6(1, 2)6(3, 4) — W(1, 2)6(1, 3)5(2, 4) .
(A4)

For the following derivation, we bring the four-point polar-
izability into the basis of spin orbitals w,(1) = Wp(ti)op(s1)
with quasiparticle orbitals w,(1) (which we take to be the KS
orbitals from Eq. (2)) and spin function o,(s;), which can be
either a(s;) or B(s1):

L(, 2,3, 4; 0) = » Vp VWq(2)Lpgrs(W)r(3)Ws(4), (A5)

with matrix elements

(A6)

Note that we skip all complex conjugates since the KS orbitals
are real-valued.

By means of the residue theorem, the matrix elements of
L° can be computed from the interacting Green’s function G
(cf. Eq. (7)), which becomes diagonal in the basis of the KS
orbitals [2, 100]:

where we denote all matrices with generic indices p,q,r, sin

L(w) = M"!(w)F (A9)

where M and F have a block structure in the product space of

occupied and unoccupied orbitals, i.e. the rows and columns
are ordered via electron-hole (ia, jb), hole-electron (ai, bj),
electron-electron (ii’, jj’) and hole-hole (aa’, bb’) sector:

The triangular shape of M(w) and the block form of F in
Eq. (A9) reduce the number of non-zero entries of L(w) con-
siderably, i.e. to the upper-left 2x2 block L”“®“(w) [2].

Until now, all quantities still comprise the spin degree of
freedom. However, even for a singlet closed-shell ground
state, the single-particle excitation is not diagonal in the spins,
which one immediately sees by explicitly writing down the
spin indices of the upper left block of M. The spin structure of
—©. + KK, which follows from the contractions in Eqs. (A4) and
(A7), then reads

with elements of the block matrices V and W given by Upg.rs
and Wpg,rs (cf. Eqs. (11) and (12)).

Bringing the upper block to diagonal form by the unitary

i.e. transforming the matrix to the basis of singlet and triplet
solutions, we obtain the singlet-triplet factor (with aS) = 2 and
a = 0) in Eq. (10) [13, 95, 100][143]

We do not explicitly denote the spin here, but the a in A
and B implicitly accounts for the spin degrees of freedom.

In the next step, we use the spectral representation of
Eq. (A16) (cf. Appendix of Ref. [105]) to rewrite Li#°“(w),
Thus, Eq. (A16) also defines the central eigenvalue equation in
Eq. (8). With the spectral representation, we obtain four blocks
with elements

In the case of the TDA, all components comprising an element

we write Eq. (A2) including the spin channels as

With Eq. (A5) and after transforming to the singlet-triplet basis
(cf. Eq. (A14)), only the singlet contribution remains with a
factor of V2 resulting from the sum over spin indices [13, 31,
95, 100]:

Combining Eq. (A19) with the block structure of Lyg,-s(w)
in Eqs. (A17), we arrive at Eq. (Al), where the spin factor is
absorbed in the transition dipole moments a from Eq. (21).

B. Energy cutoff for the BSE

In the following, we introduce the details about the trunca-
tion of the number of orbitals, which enter the BSE in Eq. (8).
In the following, we discuss the truncation of the considered
number of orbitals in Eq. (8), motivated by its heavy com-

putational scaling: Since both the number of occupied Noce
and unoccupied orbitals Nempty scales linearly with the sys-
tem size N, the index structure of Eq. (10) leads to a memory
scaling of O(N2,.N2 uty) = O(N*) and a runtime scaling of

occ’ Yempty.
ONbecNempty) = O(N®).

Beyond that, the computational effort associated with the cal-
culation of the GW quasiparticle energies needed for Eq. (10)
scales with the number of included orbital.

Hence, we adopt the idea of Ref. [39] to impose an energy
cutoff on the included states since we do not expect that low-
lying optical excitations are strongly affected by the high-lying
states, which reduces the number of states and therefore en-
ables calculations with a reasonable amount of computational
resources. Specifically, we apply the truncation as follows: (i)
We already truncate the number of orbitals based on their KS
energies, which are refined in the GW-module (cf. Fig. 1) to
keep the computational effort to the possible minimum. Corre-
spondingly, only these refined states enter the construction of
Eq. (10) (cf. Fig. 1). (i) In addition to the cutoff for unoccu-
pied states, we also specify a separate cutoff for the occupied
states targeting core levels.

We test the accuracy of this cutoff procedure for a
nanographene with L = 4. In order to only exclude the
core level states, we choose a cutoff for the occupied states
of Eo? = 80 eV, which keeps excitation energies virtually un-
changed (within less than 1 meV), but reduces Noce by approx-
imately 30% from 180 to 124. Given the negligible influence
of Egy = 80 eV on the accuracy of the calculation, we use it

throughout all further cutoff checks.

Since the unoccupied states exhibit a continous distribution
of orbital energies €,, we check four different cutoff values
En?’ = 10,20,40, 80 eV and plot the resulting spectra in

Fig. 9.

unoccupied states from 1195 to 204.

Beyond the absorption spectrum, we report the impact of
the cutoffs on the spatial descriptors, specifically on the longi-
tudinal size of the excitation d2. in Table III. We determine
the corresponding excitation level n from the largest oscillator
strength f” (corresponding to the highest peak of Im a(w),
ef. Eq. (F3)) for each cutoff value Eo”. Again, we find only
minor deviations around 2%.

Taking into account the sizable acceleration provided by
these cutoffs, we execute the calculations in the main text
employing the cutoffs E°° = 80 eV and Ex’ = 10 eV,
enabling simulation of GW-BSE for large system sizes with
up to 242 atoms for L = 13, which then corresponds to

NoceNempty = 2.3 + 10°.

C. Isotropic polarizability and photoabsorption

D. Computational details of GW-BSE and
TDDFT calculations

The majority of the calculations in this paper is done with
the CP2K package [83-85]. CP2K uses Gaussian basis sets
for representing the KS orbitals in Eq. (2), where we employ
the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set [115, 116] throughout the paper,
provided by the EMSL database [144]. These all-electron cal-
culations are executed within the Gaussian and augmented
plane-waves scheme [145]. The GW implementation is based

12

on Ref. [91], where the the analytic continuation is applied
in the computation of the self-energy (3) using 16 Padé ap-
proximants and a frequency grid with 100 points unless stated
otherwise. By using evGWo @PBE, we get rid of numerical
artifacts caused by the pole structure of the self-energy [89, 90],
which can occur for the PBE functional [131].

The reference calculations to check the numerical validity
of our implementation have been done using the FHI-aims
code [39, 112-114], where we have used the gaussian-tight
settings together with the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set [115, 116]
applying the same parameters for the evGWo calculations spec-
ified before.

The TDDFT module in CP2K is based on the Tamm Dancoff
approximation [146-150], which uses the auxiliary density
matrix method to enable efficient calculations with hybrid
functionals. There, we have chosen the aug-cc-pVDZ [115,
116] and aug-DZVP-MOLOPT-GTH-tier-2 basis sets (basis set
generation recipe as in Refs. [151, 152]) in combination with
the admm-2 [153] auxiliary basis. The exchange-correlation
functionals employed in this work (cf. Sec. V and App. H)
are PBE [131], BLYP [132, 133], PBEO [154], B3LYP [132,
134, 135], HSE06 [136, 137] as well as CAM-B3LYP [138].

E. GW-BSE benchmark on Thiel’s set

In this appendix, we provide further details about the param-
eters of the analytic continuation, which we have used to com-
pute the real-frequency self-energy both in the GW-modules
of CP2K [91] and FHI-aims [112, 113].

In Fig. 2, we have presented a benchmark for Thiel’s
set [111], where the CP2K calculation employed 128 param-
eters for the Padé function and 500 points in the frequency
grid whereas we have used 16 and 100, respectively, for the
calculation with FHI-aims, resulting in mean absolute error

of 30.2 meV.

In Fig. 10, we show another comparison for 16 Padé param-
eters and 100 points for the frequency grid in both CP2K and
FHI-aims. We observe slightly larger deviations between the
implementations of 4.7 meV MAE and a maximum absolute
error of 42.3 meV over the ten lowest excitation energies across
all molecules.

F. Absorption spectra from experiment and the-
ory: dielectric function and polarizability

In this appendix, we connect the optical absorption spec-
trum of a rectangular nanographene from experiment [118]
quantified via the dielectric function and from GW-BSE com-
puted via the polarizability of a finite nanographene. To that
end, we start from the experimental reflectance difference mea-
surements, from which they extract the anisotropic dielectric
function Ae = €, — €,. We approximate the anisotropic dielec-
tric function Ae by its longitudinal component e,, i.e. Ae = €,

G. Effect of the Tamm-Dancoff approximation
in GW-BSE

In Fig. 7, we have compared the excitation properties com-
puted from BSE@evGWo against TDDFT with different ex-
change-correlation functionals, where we have employed the
TDA [Eq. (18)] for both frameworks. Here, we want to assess
the deviations introduced by the TDA and compare the results
obtained from the TDA in Eq. (18) against the solution of the
full ABBA-matrix in Eq. (8) within BSE@evGWp. In Fig. 11,
we plot the excitation energy and the corresponding size of
the respective lowest bright state (p = 1) for the solutions of
Eqs. (8) and (18). We observe only minor deviations of at most
0.22 eV for energies (at small L) and of 0.32 A in sizes of the
excitation (at large L) for all nanographene lengths L.

The details of the respective optical absorption spectra com-
puted via Eq. (20) are shown in Fig. 12 for L = 13. Despite
minor changes in peak frequencies and heights, we conclude
that our findings from Sec. V do not change when diagonaliz-
ing Eq. (8) instead of Eq. (18).

H. TDDFT with manually tuned PBEh

change-correlation functionals and the respective properties

functional in TDDFT strongly influences both the excitation
energy and the size of the excitation.

However, the employed functionals do not only feature dif-
ferent fraction of exact exchange, but also different contribu-
tions for the underlying exchange and correlation functionals.
In order to unambiguously tie the accuracy for predictions of
excitation properties to the exact exchange fraction, we show
energies and sizes of the first bright excitation for varying
amount of exact exchange in the PBEh functional in Fig. 13,
i.e. PBEO (25%) with exact exchange varied between 0% (PBE)
and 100%. Again, we observe that both excitation energies and
sizes critically depend on the chosen exchange exact fraction.
