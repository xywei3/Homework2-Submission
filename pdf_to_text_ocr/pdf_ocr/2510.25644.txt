ABSTRACT: We investigate the universal features of chiral symmetry breaking in large-N’
QCD by comparing non-perturbative determinations of the low-lying Dirac spectrum with
chiral Random Matrix Theory (RMT) predictions. Our numerical Monte Carlo calcula-
tions are based on a chiral lattice discretization of the Dirac operator, and exploit twisted
volume reduction to reach N as large as 841. Matching lattice data with RMT analytic
results, we are able to extract the large-N chiral condensate, which is compared with a
recent determination obtained with non-chiral Wilson quarks from twisted volume-reduced

models.

1 Introduction

Spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is a distinctive feature of QCD which has funda-
mental phenomenological implications for strong interactions, and tight connections with
other prominent non-perturbative properties of the theory, such as 6-dependence and con-
finement. Due to this crucial role, it has been the subject of a large number of studies in
the last decades, aiming at improving our understanding of its microscopic origin and of
its universal traits.

In this respect, a staple result is provided by the Banks-Casher relation [1]: the realiza-
tion of chiral symmetry in QCD puts strong constraints on the properties of the low-lying
Dirac spectrum. Building on this fundamental finding, it has been argued [2-6] that the
eigenvalues of the Dirac operator follow the same universal probability distributions as
those of an ensemble of random matrices, where the whole dependence on the microscopic
details of the full theory is encoded in a single parameter, identified with the chiral con-
densate © = —(¢%w). In the fundamental representation and when N, the number of
colors, is larger than 2, the universality class is described by the so-called chiral unitary
Random Matrix Theory (RMT). By now, non-perturbative lattice calculations have clearly

established this correspondence in QCD from first-principles, both in the chirally-broken
phase [7-16] and in the chirally-restored phase sufficiently above the Anderson mobility
edge [17-21], by comparing numerical results for the Dirac spectrum with analytic RMT
predictions (see also Refs. [22-25] for reviews and further references).
Apart from standard QCD, chiral symmetry breaking plays a fundamental theoretical
and phenomenological role also in other QCD-like gauge theories, such as large-N QCD
in the ’t Hooft limit, obtained when the number of colors N is taken to infinity N — oo
at a fixed ’t Hooft coupling \ = g?N and for a fixed number of quark flavors N; (i.c.,
N,/N -> 0). For this reason, in the last two decades chiral symmetry breaking has been
extensively studied in this regime on the lattice. However, most of these studies addressed
the determination of the chiral condensate either through the Banks—Casher relation, or

through the quark mass dependence of the pion mass [26-33], while the investigation of
the realization of the universal chiral RMT behavior of the large-N Dirac spectrum has
only been addressed in a few seminal papers [34, 35] (see also [36]). The goal of the present
paper is to fill this gap and address the universal features of chiral symmetry breaking
in large-N QCD via state-of-the-art lattice calculations. To do so, we will consider the
Twisted Eguchi-Kawai (TEK) model [37-39].

The TEK model is an effective framework to study lattice gauge theories in the large-N
limit by exploiting a fundamental property of large-N gauge theories: the so-called large-
N volume reduction [37-48]. In their pioneering paper, Eguchi and Kawai [40] showed
that, in the large-N limit, the Yang—Mills lattice theory enjoys a dynamical equivalence
between space-time and color degrees of freedom, leading the model to become insensitive
to finite-volume effects when N — oo. Taking this idea to the extreme, it allows to
study large-N gauge theories in the thermodynamic limit even on a volume-reduced 1-site
lattice [32, 49-71]. This has the advantage of dramatically reducing the computational
burden related to the space-time degrees of freedom, and allows to reach very large values
of N ~ O(10? — 103) in feasible simulations. Thus, unlike standard approaches to study
large-N gauge theories—where the N = oo limit is typically approached from N < 10
values via extrapolation (28-31, 72-98]—the TEK model practically allows to work directly
at N = oo. Large-N volume reduction works provided that center symmetry is unbroken.
Spontaneous center symmetry breaking that would occur when reducing the lattice size due

to the well-known deconfinement transition [73, 99-109] is avoided in the TEK approach
by imposing twisted boundary conditions on the gauge fields in all directions, hence the
name of the model.! The TEK approach has been extensively used in the last decade, and
has allowed to achieve significant progress in the study of several large-N gauge theories,
such as large-N QCD [32, 33, 57, 61, 64, 67, 68], large-N SUSY Yang-Mills [69-71], and
large-N adjoint QCD [58, 62, 110].

In order to compare RMT predictions with our large-N non-perturbative determina-
tions of the low-lying Dirac eigenvalues, it is of the utmost importance to preserve chiral
symmetry even at finite lattice spacing. It is thus imperative to use a lattice formulation
of the Dirac operator that satisfies the Ginsparg—Wilson relation [111]. For this reason, we
implemented an overlap discretization [112-114] of chiral quarks within our TEK model
via the so-called “truncated overlap” approach [115-120]. This approach is presented here

for the first time, as previous TEK studies have all employed non-chiral Wilson fermions.

1This is not the only strategy that has been applied to enforce center symmetry on a small box and
achieve large-N volume independence see, e.g., Refs. [41, 45-47].
Our study of the universal traits of the Dirac spectrum will be articulated in two main
parts. First, we will compare our results with scale-invariant RMT predictions in order
to establish the universal behavior of Dirac eigenvalues in a parameter-agnostic fashion.
Then, we will match our results to parameter-dependent RMT analytic results in order
to extract the large-N quark condensate ©/N ~ O(N®). This will be important for two
reasons: first, to verify that different lattice-RMT matching prescriptions lead to the same
value of the condensate, and second, to see how this chiral determination of U/N compares
with the latest TEK one obtained in [33] with non-chiral Wilson quarks.

This paper is organized as follows: in Sec. 2 we provide a compact summary of a few
RMT predictions that we aim at checking; in Sec. 3 we discuss our lattice setup, focusing
in particular on our TEK implementation of the chiral lattice Dirac operator; in Sec. 4
we discuss our numerical results, focusing on the comparison of lattice data with RMT
predictions and on the extraction of the chiral condensate; finally, in Sec. 5 we draw our
conclusions and discuss future outlooks of this study.

2 Random Matrix Theory predictions

The relevant universality class to describe large-N QCD is the chiral unitary RMT. Within
this effective model, it is possible to derive analytic predictions for the probability distribu-
tions pz (zp) of the k™ eigenvalue zz of the random matrix ensemble for any fixed topological
sector Q [121] (in this discussion the spectrum is assumed to be ordered increasingly, and
any degeneracy in the spectrum is assumed to be factored out). As an example, in the
Q = 0 sector, the distributions of the two lowest eigenvalues z; and zo and of their ratio
r = 2/29 are given by [34, 121]:

pila) = sae, (2.1)
p2(z2) = henttan I duu [I2(u)? — y(u)J3(u)] , (2.2)
pr) = icp [ due i y3 [Zo(u)? — T(u)I3(u)] , (2.3)

with I,,(x) the n** modified Bessel function of the first kind,

n() Ey Taran (3 0 an 4)
m=0

In the thermodynamic limit V — oo, one expects the following identification to hold,
topological sector by topological sector, for the eigenvalues of the massless Dirac operator:

Thus, for asymptotically large volumes, Eq. (2.5) is expected to bridge the RMT eigenvalues
zz and the corresponding Dirac eigenvalues A, for all k via a single parameter, the quark
condensate “1. Since on the lattice one typically computes the spectrum of the massless
chiral lattice Dirac operator in a finite volume [10-12, 34, 35], one expects to see deviations
from chiral RMT predictions, which should become smaller and smaller and occur for higher
and higher k as V — oo. Such deviations typically manifest in the fact that, assuming
Eq. (2.5), different choices of k lead to different results for D.

For this reason, our check of the universal features of the large-N Dirac spectrum will
be subdivided into two steps. First, we will monitor deviations of lattice Dirac eigenvalues
with respect to RMT predictions in a parameter-free, scale-invariant way by computing
the deviation from 1 of the following ratios as a function of the volume:

Rey ko = (Ae) (edo) (2.6)

7ko) RMT

Here (O) and (©),.,,,., denote respectively the expectation values taken in the full theory
and in the RMT effective model. Given that in these eigenvalue ratios the factor of UV
drops and no free parameter can be adjusted, this comparison constitutes a very strong
test of the universal traits of the spectrum.

Then, once the correct volume regime has been established, we will move to parameter-
dependent RMT predictions, and we will test them by matching lattice data and analytic
results to extract the quark condensate assuming the relation (2.5). This can be done
either by computing the full probability distribution of the first few eigenvalues and fitting
it to RMT predictions, such as those in Eqs. (2.1)-(2.3), or by computing the following
ratios:

ry = (2k) pwr (2.7)
(Ak)

These two routes should of course lead to compatible estimates. Since all RMT predic-
tions are described by the same single parameter ©, we will check that different matching
prescriptions—i.e., different choices of k—to extract the chiral condensate give compatible
result for the condensate when the corresponding A, eigenvalues are in the RMT regime.
Moreover, we will compare these determinations of © with the one found in [33] for non-
chiral Wilson quarks.

3 Numerical setup

This section provides an overview of our lattice discretization for the gluon and the quark
sectors, with particular emphasis on the adopted chiral formulation of the Dirac operator,
which is implemented for the TEK model in this study for the first time.

3.1 Lattice action

In the ’t Hooft large-N limit quarks are quenched, i.e., non-dynamical. From the point
of view of lattice simulations, this means that we will draw gluonic configurations from
the Monte Carlo according to the pure-gauge action, ignoring the fermion determinant.
Then, these gluon fields will constitute the background of the chiral lattice Dirac operator
(defined in the next section) which will be employed for spectrum computations.
The TEK partition function of the d = 4 single-site TEK model describing the gluonic
sector reads:

d
i / [duje~Swl"l, [du] = TJ (av, ]. (3.1)
pal
with [dU] the SU(N) invariant Haar measure and

walvAp

the TEK Wilson plaquette action. The Monte Carlo algorithm employed for the sampling
of this functional integral is described in detail in Ref. [63]. In Eq. (3.2) b = 1/(Ng?) is
the inverse bare ’t Hooft coupling, U, are the d = 4 SU(N) gauge link matrices describ-
ing lattice gluon fields, and z,, is the twist factor used to implement twisted boundary
conditions. It is chosen to be a N*b-root of unity:

Qri
Zon = 2 = EXP {ren . (3.3)

There are several possible choices of the twist factor; here, we will adopt the so-called
symmetric twist. This means that N is taken to be a perfect square N = L?, and that the
integer-valued anti-symmetric twist tensor n,,, is taken to be:

Np =—Nw =k(L)L, (v>p), (3.4)

with k(L) a co-prime integer with L. In the end, thus:

k(L
Zp = exp {2m ( Deum} 5 Eup = Eps Ey,=1 (v'> yp). (3.5)

L

As explained in Refs. [39, 122, 123], the flux parameter k(L) and its inverse (mod L) k(L)
have to be scaled with L to keep |k|/L and |k|/L bounded from below (by ~ 0.1) in order
to avoid center-symmetry breaking [124-127] that would invalidate one of the assumptions
behind large-N volume reduction. In addition, it has been shown in perturbation theory
that suitable choices of k,k help in reducing non-planar finite-N corrections (65, 128}.

As explained in the introduction, even if the TEK model is formulated on a reduced
1-point box, this does not mean at all that our fields propagate in a torus of vanishing
volume. Indeed, by virtue of large-N volume independence and of the adopted twisted
boundary conditions, physical excitations actually propagate on an extended torus with an
effective physical size given by:

0=aL=aVN, (3.6)

with a(b) the lattice spacing. This means that in our setup, at fixed coupling b, the
thermodynamic limit is achieved when N — ov. It is in this limit that we expect RMT
predictions to hold.
3.2 Lattice chiral Dirac operator

The non-chiral TEK Wilson discretization of the Dirac operator, first discussed in Ref. [64],
is given by the following N? x N? matrix (where N? is the size of the effective volume in
lattice units in the TEK approach):

Dw(mw) = 4+ mw — = x (1+ yy) ® Wa + (1— yy) ® wih] : (3.7)
Wy = — "Ty Ty + TT a, (3.8)

with I, the twist eaters [129], SU(N) matrices satisfying TP, = 2},TLI,, with z,,, the
same twist factor appearing in (3.3). To derive this expression, one lets quarks live on an

extended periodic lattice with periodicity VN (recall that ae = 1), and let them interact

VE

with a periodic potential obtained by replicating the 1-site gauge fields VN times. To some
extent, this is reminiscent of the Bloch description of electrons in a crystal.

Building on this non-chiral definition, we can now proceed to define a chiral lattice
Dirac operator. For this purpose, we have implemented a chiral Dirac operator using the
so-called “truncated overlap” formulation [118-120, 130], whose definition will be sum-
marized in the following. The starting point is the 5d Mébius Domain Wall (DW) Dirac
operator [131] (here N, is the size of the 5‘ dimension):

Dow (m, M, Ns) = Dw(—M)X (mh, Ns) + Y (mm, Ns), (3.9)

with m the bare quark mass in lattice units. The operator Dw(—M) is the TEK Wilson
Dirac operator [64] earlier discussed with a negative kernel mass M = 1+s (0 < s < 1), and
where we have replaced the standard links U,, with stout smeared [132] links U,,. Instead,
the X(7m, N;) and Y(7n,N;) operators appearing in Eq. (3.9) are matrices acting on the
5'* dimension, whose expressions are:

X(m,N;) = B+ CMs(rn) (3.10
Y (mh, Ns) = 1+ Ms(7) (3.11
ME? (in) = (Prdsit + Peds—1t) — 1 (P.6s,ne51p + Pads,15t,N5) (3.12

with P, = (1+ 5)/2, Px = (1—75)/2 the chiral projectors, and with

BO = by dans (3.13

OF) = cbs, (3.14

diagonal matrices in the 5 52 dimension. The choice of the vectors bs and c, will be discussed
later in this section. From Dpw, the four-dimensional truncated overlap operator D is built
via the following projection:

D(th, M, Ns) = [PD5y(M, i = 1,.Ns)Dow(M,m, Ns)P], , ; (3.15)
with P = P,6s,1+Pr(ds+1,t+5s,161,N;)- This yields the following expression for the truncated
overlap [118, 119, 130, 131] that we will use in our study:
l-pom l-—mh

1
2 + 2

D(tn, M, Ns) = 75 S(M, Ns). (3.16)

In this expression, the function S(M, N;) is given by:

Tr, [1+ daa — TI, [2-24 0]
S(M, Ns) = a) (3.17)
TIM, [1+ 28M] +18, [1-H ay]
with
HY (M) = (bs + ¢s)95Dw(—M) [(bs — es) Dw(—-M) + 2]71. (3.18)

The choice of the vectors bs and cs is arbitrary as long as S(M,N;) reproduces the sign
function of overlap fermions in the limit N; — oo. Different choices correspond to different
lattice formulations, including Shamir-, Borici-, and Chiu-type realizations of domain wall
fermions [116-118, 133], all agreeing in the continuum limit. In this study we chose bs = 1
and c, = 0, corresponding to the Shamir operator. With this choice, we obtain:

ag Ns _ 1) _ ay ¢ Myo
S(M, Ns) Hw(M) x [L Hw (M)] (3.19)
[L+ Hw(M)}° + [lL — Hw}
with Hy(M) the (y5-Hermitian) kerne
Hw(M) = y5Dw(—M) [2+ Dw(—M)]?. (3.20)

In the limit N; > oo, when the size of the 5" dimension goes to infinity, we recognize that
S(M,N;) tends to the sign of the kernel Hw (M):

. 1l+2)*-—(1—2)% .
im, (+2)*+0 =n) = sign(z). (3.21

Therefore, in the limit N; > ov, the truncated overlap tends to the actual overlap operator:
lim D(rn,M, Ns) = D(vh, M) , (3.22

which takes the form

lth. 1—m
D(it, M) = a1 > VM) = (1 i) Do(M) +m, (3.23

with V(M) = 95 sign [Hw(M)], and Do(J) the massless overlap operator,

1+V(M)

Do(M) = 5

(3.24
In order to restore physical units in the lattice operator D and in the lattice mass
m and connect them to their physical counterparts, one needs to perform the following
rescaling:
M(2-—M
p= MIA MA) 55 cy (3.25)

a

M2-M
m= MQM), (3.26)
a

where m is the bare quark mass in physical units. The pre-factor M(2— M), which
stems from the choice of the kernel in Eq. (3.20), was worked out analytically by requiring
that the spectrum of the massless operator in Eq. (3.25) in the free case was equal to p
in momentum space. More details can be found in the Appendix (see also Ref. [134]).
Clearly, the same normalization applies when restoring physical units in the eigenvalues of
the massless overlap Dirac operator:

Do(M)ux = \(M)us, (3.27)
AM) = 5 E +2840) . (3.28)
— Mea sa. (3.29)

Apart from this necessary overall rescaling, M is expected to play no other role, and
any possible weak M-dependence observed in a physical quantity is just a lattice artifact
vanishing in the continuum limit, see, e.g., Ref. [135].

4 Numerical results

This section is devoted to present our non-perturbative lattice results for the low-lying
chiral Dirac spectrum, and to discuss the comparison with RMT predictions. As already
anticipated, we will conduct such comparison both in a parameter-free and in a parameter-
dependent fashion. The latter approach will also allow the extraction of the large-N chiral
condensate U/N ~ O(N°), whose value will be compared with the latest large-N TEK
determination with non-chiral Wilson quarks [33]. Simulation parameters are summarized
in Tab. 1, along with the value of the string tension o from the TEK model [57], used for
scale setting.

4.1 Checking the chiral properties of the lattice Dirac operator

We start our discussion by examining the chiral properties of the truncated overlap oper-
ator. Indeed, one should check that the adopted N; is large enough to have sufficiently
small chirality violations (i.e., a negligible residual mass). These are monitored through
the figure of merit:

A= a (4.1)

Table 1: Values of the number of colors N, of the effective size L = VN, and of the parameters k, k
[where kk = 1 (mod L)/ used in this study. The string tension o was computed in the TEK model

in [57]. Finally, neon is the number of statistically-independent gauge configurations employed.

The violation parameter A was computed stochastically using 3 random Z4-sources
z with color and Dirac indices. After a few tests, we concluded that, in order to achieve
satisfactory small values of A, smaller values of N; were sufficient when the gauge links
entering the truncated overlap Dirac operator were smeared. As an example, A ~ 1078
was achieved with N; = 60 and no smearing, while the same result was obtained choosing
N; = 24 and n, = 5 stout-smearing steps (with isotropic stout parameter p = 0.1 [132]).
The latter choice of smearing parameters corresponds to a smearing radius [136]:

Fe 8pns = 2. (4.2)

a
This is equal in magnitude to the choice adopted in other stout-smeared definitions of
the lattice Dirac operator employed in recent state-of-the-art lattice QCD simulations.
For example, the BMW collaboration recently employed a stout-smeared definition of the
staggered Dirac operator with n, = 4 and p = 0.125—corresponding to R,/a = 2—in their
recent lattice investigations of the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon
anomalous magnetic moment [137, 138].
The choice of using stout-smeared links was also useful to reduce the computational burden
and make N = 841 calculations feasible. Indeed, at fixed N, N;, and number of computed
eigenvalues, we found that spectra calculations involving the stout-smeared operator were
~ 3 times less expensive with respect to the non-smeared case, on top of the ~ 2.5 reduction
of N; at fixed A achieved using stout smearing, which decreases the computational effort
by the same factor. Thus, all our results have been obtained for N; = 24 and stout-smeared
gauge links with n, = 5 and p = 0.1, yielding A < 10~® for all explored values of N and b.

Another interesting test of the good chiral properties of our truncated overlap Dirac
operator is to check that lattice eigenvalues lie on the overlap circle:

1 lig

545 (4.3)

with \ the eigenvalue of the massless overlap operator. In Fig. 1 we plot as en example the
first two complex eigenvalues Ar and Ag. Due to Y5-hermiticity, eigenvalues come in pairs
that have the same real part and opposite imaginary parts. Thanks to this symmetry, we
can just limit to plot the upper half of the circle in the complex plane. The plots in Fig. 1

1.2, Ns = 24 and stout-smeared gauge links with stout parameters p = 0.1, ns = 5, corresponding
to a smoothing radius of two lattice spacings. The solid black line stands for the expected overlap
circle (4.3) in the complex plane. Left panel: N = 529, b = 0.355. Right panel: N = 841, b = 0.360.

refer to the cases N = 529 at b = 0.355 and N = 841 at b = 0.360, corresponding to similar
effective sizes in physical units:

b= 0.355, N = 529 bo = (aVa)VN ~ 5.54, (4.4)

b= 0.360, N = 841 bJo = (aVa)VN ~ 5.97. (4.5)

As it can be observed, all eigenvalues of all configurations considered indeed lie on the
overlap circle for N; = 24 and our choice of smearing parameters. It is worth commenting
that the eigenvalues displayed in the plot were obtained by choosing the free parameter MW
appearing in the overlap operator as M = 1.2. After checking for the N = 289 ensemble
that M = 1.5 gave perfectly compatible results for the eigenvalue distributions, we kept
this choice throughout all calculations.

4.2 Scale-invariant RMT predictions

To test the agreement between our overlap eigenvalues and Random Matrix Theory (RMT),
we analyzed the ratios defined in Eq. (2.6), and quantified their deviation from unity.
In order to compute the expectation values (A,), we computed the first few low-lying
eigenvalues of the massless overlap operator for a few hundred gauge configurations, and
we identified the physical Dirac eigenvalue \ with the absolute value of the overlap one Xo:

A— |Aol, aX) = M(2—M))A. (4.6)
Clearly, we could have also opted for the imaginary part of A, as well, being the real part
just a lattice artifact that vanishes in the continuum limit. However, we practically ob-
served no numerical difference between (Im{.,}) and ({Ao|), as Re{A,} turned out to be
always at least one order of magnitude smaller than Im{Ao} for all computed eigenvalues,

cerning the topological sector, we did not find any exact zero-mode in our spectra, thus,
we compared our data with RMT predictions in the Q = 0 topological sector.

In Fig. 2 we plot the results obtained for b = 0.355 and b = 0.360, for several choices
of ky; and kg. Let us first comment the b = 0.360 case, where two values of N are reported.
As it can be seen, for N = 529, corresponding to ¢/o ~ 4.73, one can clearly observe
deviations from RMT predictions, which can become as large as ~ 15%. Smaller values of
N = 289,361, not shown in the plot, exhibit even larger deviations. On the other hand,
when N is increased to 841, corresponding to the larger size £\/o ~ 5.97, we observe perfect
agreement with RMT predictions within errors in all examined cases, up to ky, kg = 4.
For the coarser point 6 = 0.355, where N = 529 corresponds to (\/o = 5.54 (ie., an
intermediate volume between the two earlier discussed), we observe small deviations of the

order of a few percent (~ 5% at most). Overall, thus, the collected evidence shows that
finite-volume effects play a crucial role in the present analysis, and that the agreement
between lattice data and RMT predictions is controlled by the effective size in physical
units. As £ > oo, ie., as N — o6 at fixed b, RMT predictions become more and more
accurate.

Analogous conclusions can be drawn by comparing the lattice distribution of the ratio
of eigenvalues r = A, /A2 with the parameter-free RMT prediction for p(r) in Eq. (2.3). As

it can be seen in Fig. 3, the numerical results for the normalized distribution of r,

obtained for the two largest effective sizes explored — namely, N = 529 at b = 0.355 and
N = 841 at b = 0.360 — agree very well with expectations. We stress again that the curves
shown in Fig. 3 are scale-invariant RMT predictions with no free parameter, and thus there
is no fitting procedure involved in the comparison with numerical data.

4.3 Parameter-dependent RMT predictions

Our previous analysis showed that an effective size (\/o 2 5.5 is sufficient for the first
few Dirac eigenvalues to fall into the RMT regime. The goal of this section is to check
that their parameter-dependent probability distribution is indeed described by the analytic
RMT functional form with the same parameter ©.

In the large-N TEK case, the relation between RMT and Dirac eigenvalues in (2.5) is
modified as:

D>)
Zh = dey V=a'‘N?, (4.8)

where we performed the substitution © — N/N, which is the quantity that possesses a
finite large-N limit, and where we have used the fact that in the TEK model the lattice
size £ = aL is replaced by the effective torus size = aL = aVN. There are two possible
ways to extract =/N from RMT predictions:

(1) Performing a best fit of the normalized lattice probability distribution of aA, to the
expected RMT shapes assuming the following relation:

Zp = (aAz)A, A= a= N?, (4.9)

with A the only fit parameter. For example, the normalized RMT probability distri-
bution for the first eigenvalue x; = a, assuming (4.9) reads:

2
1

1
py (a1) = 5(Aeije tA (4.10)

This strategy, adopted in [34, 35], does not only allow to extract the condensate,
but also constitutes a strong test of the agreement between lattice data and RMT

predictions.

(2) From Eq. (4.8), computing this ratio of expectation values:

where

This strategy (2) has been applied in previous standard QCD studies to extract
the condensate from RMT predictions [10-16]. Clearly, it should provide compatible
estimates for ©/N with respect to (1).

For the two largest effective volumes (N = 529 for b = 0.355 and N = 841 for
b = 0.360), best fits of lattice data for the probability distribution of the first few eigenvalues
yield satisfactory reduced chi-squared ¥? = x?/ngor, confirming the quality of the RMT
description. As an example, we show in Fig. 4 the best fits of the numerical probability

and as a function of N.

The differences observed at smaller values of N in the condensates extracted from
higher eigenvalues, as discussed in the previous section, can be regarded as finite-volume
effects due to not being yet in the regime where RMT provides a reliable description. It
is known that RMT is expected to hold in the so-called ~-regime of QCD [139], see, e.g.,
Refs. [22, 140]. Customarily, QCD is studied in the so-called p-regime, obtained taking
first the thermodynamic limit ZL — oo at fixed and finite quark mass and then the chiral
limit, so that m,L — oo. In the e-regime, instead, m > 0 and L > oo with mXV < O(1).
Since mUV = 2( F,zm,L?)?, this means that m,L — 0 while FL — oo. It was shown in
Ref. [139] that finite-volume corrections to the thermodynamic limit in the e-regime are
) = 1/(F2VV). This

behavior is very different from the customary exponential suppression of finite-size effects

power-like, and can be expanded in series of the variable 1/(F?L?

in the p-regime, and is related to the peculiar way of taking the chiral and thermodynamic
limits.

We empirically tried to check whether the volume-dependence of our data can be
described by polynomials in the variable « = 1/ VV or not, with V = a?N? the effective
volume. Interestingly, our results for the condensate for b = 0.360 as a function of N’
obtained from the first four low-lying eigenvalues can be all well described by polynomial
curves in this variable, extrapolating to compatible values at x = 0, and with similar slopes
close to zero, see Fig. 5 (left panel). From these fits we can quote the following final result:

aD

“= = 0.605(35) x 107°.

= (4.13)

where the central value is the average of the four extrapolations, and the quoted error is
the maximum semi-dispersion observed among them. The observed behavior of the best
fits performed on a k-by-k basis also lead us to try a global best fit of the data, assuming

the following functional form:

Sy = 0.575(25) x 10-3. (4.16)

where again the error is the sum of a statistical and a systematic one, taking into account
the dispersion among the data. In order to be conservative, we will consider the result in
Eq. (4.13) as our final overlap determination for b = 0.360, as this has the largest error
among the results in Eqs. (4.13), (4.15) and (4.16).

Clearly, apart from polynomials in 1/ VV, also other functional forms could equally well
describe our data. Thus, to really pinpoint the exact form of finite-size corrections, more
theoretical studies would be needed to work out the expected ¢-regime volume-dependence
of QCD low-energy constants in the TEK model. This is left for future studies.

4.4 Renormalization of the overlap condensate and comparison with Wilson
quarks

In order to compare our overlap determination of =/N with the previous TEK one obtained
in Ref. [33] with Wilson fermions, it is necessary to renormalize 4. The overlap valence
quark mass and the overlap chiral condensate renormalize as follows:

De = Zed) (4.17)

My = Zam = ZI (4.18)

where am = M(2—M)rn, and where we used the relation Z,,Zs = 1, holding by virtue of the
lattice chiral symmetry. These renormalization constants depend on the renormalization

scheme s and on the renormalization scale ». From now on, any presented renormalized

scale: s = MS and p = 2 GeV. In this work we assume pp = 2 GeV —> pp/\/o = 3.75 as in
the previous large-N studies [31, 33].

In order to compute Z., we follow the strategy put forward in Ref. [11]. In this study,
the authors obtained Zg for overlap quarks from the ratio of the bare overlap mass and
the continuum renormalized mass matched at equal values of the pion mass, for a certain

Following again the lines of Ref. [11], we compute the continuum renormalized quark mass
mg as a function of m; using Wilson fermion results. Within the TEK model, we computed
the Wilson pion mass as a function of the bare Wilson quark mass [33]. Concerning non-
perturbative determinations of Z, needed to renormalize the bare Wilson quark mass, in
absence of direct TEK determinations, we relied on the finite-N determinations of [141],
suitably extrapolated towards N = oo and interpolated at our values of the lattice spacing.
We refer the reader to Ref. [33] for more details on this point.

First, we computed the renormalized mass in physical units for several values of the

hopping parameter « and of the coupling b (here «, is the critical hopping parameter):

sa (mz) = Ay (4.23)

In Fig. 6 we plot the curve in Eq. (4.23), and on top of it we also show the fitted
points (b = 0.360, 0.365, 0.370, 0.375) to which we have subtracted lattice artifacts (i.e. the
terms proportional to A; and A3). This figure shows the very good quality of the best fit,
which has ¥? ~ 0.84. On a side note, we observe that 1/(2A2) = Bro, with Bao =
Dr/(F2Vc). We find Br/V/o = 5.58(22), in perfect agreement with the determination
Br/Vo = 5.58(26) of [33] from individual b-by-b chiral fits to the quark-mass dependence
of the pion mass.

Finally, we measured the overlap pion mass for 7 = 0.02, which was found to be:

This will be our reference matching point to compute Z, from Eq. (4.19), and is reported

in Fig. 6 as a solid line. This value is obtained from the customary exponential best fit

to the pion correlator, cf. Fig. 7 (left panel). This correlation function is obtained from a
standard GEVP analysis using an extended basis of smeared pseudo-scalar operators. As
a standard cross-check, we verified that the effective mass, obtained by solving the GEVP
at all times, exhibits a plateau in the same range where we performed the exponential best
fit. A constant fit to this plateau gives the perfectly compatible result mee? 0.98(4),

cf. Fig. 7 (right panel). For more details on the GEVP analysis we performed, we refer the

reader to Ref. [33], a dedicated paper on the extraction of the low-lying meson spectrum
of large-N QCD from the TEK model.

The renormalization constant from Eq. (4.19), matched at the overlap pion and quark
mass reported in (4.24), reads:

In order to check the magnitude of possible finite-size effects affecting our pion mass

calculation, we also repeated the matching procedure to obtain Zs for a heavier pion.
In particular, we chose 7 = 0.034 (am = 0.03264), and found that it corresponded to
Mr / fo = 1.244(24), ie., mel ~ 4.86 (which is larger than the smallest value of mr used
with Wilson fermions in Ref. [33]). Adopting this determination as the reference pion mass
leads to mg/V/o = 0.1388(54), cf. Fig. 6 (dashed line), and eventually to Z; = 1.143(45),
which is perfectly compatible with the estimate in Eq. (4.25).

Considering our final result for the bare overlap condensate in lattice units obtained
in the previous section,

3
+ = 0.605(35) x 1073, (4.26

and using Zs in Eq. (4.25), we finally find, for the renormalized condensate in physica

units:

It is now interesting to compare our overlap result with the large-N TEK Wilson determi-
nation of [33]. On general grounds, overlap fermions are expected to be affected by O(a?

leading lattice artifacts, as opposed to Wilson fermions, which instead suffer for O(a) cor-

rections to the continuum limit. This means that overlap fermions are expected to exhibi
a faster convergence towards the continuum limit. This different behavior is due to the
fact that they enjoy the lattice chiral symmetry, unlike Wilson fermions. Because of this,
overlap and Wilson results obtained at the same value of b do not need to agree. For the
same lattice spacing, b = 0.360, we found with Wilson fermions in the chiral limit [33]:

In the continuum limit, instead:

Our overlap result is indeed much closer to the continuum value with respect to the Wilson
one obtained at the same lattice spacing. Our overlap result is thus perfectly consistent
with the general theoretical expectation that overlap quarks exhibit a faster convergence
towards the continuum limit by virtue of the lattice chiral symmetry.

5 Conclusions

We have presented the first investigation of the universal features of chiral symmetry break-
ing in large-N QCD from the TEK model, whose employment allowed us to reach N as
large as N = 841.

Adopting a chiral formulation of the Dirac operator, first presented in this study for
the TEK model, we showed clear evidence that the low-lying massless Dirac spectrum of

large-N QCD follows RMT predictions when the effective size in physical units = av/N is
sufficiently large, both by comparing scale-invariant analytic results with numerical data,
and by best fitting lattice eigenvalue probability distributions to RMT functional forms.
Chiral condensate determinations extracted from the first few low-lying eigenvalues differ
at finite N, but come together as N is increased, confirming that eventually only one
single free-parameter describes them all in the thermodynamic limit, as expected from
RMT. After renormalization, our overlap determination of the chiral condensate, despite
being obtained for a single value of the lattice spacing, turns out to be very close to the
continuum TEK determination obtained in [33] from Wilson fermions. This fact is in
perfect agreement with the general theoretical expectation that overlap quarks are affected
by smaller O(a?) lattice artifacts — compared to the O(a) affecting Wilson quarks — by
virtue of the lattice chiral symmetry. Clearly, overlap and Wilson determinations will only
fully coincide in the continuum limit.

There are many future research directions that could be explored with overlap fermions.
It would be very interesting to extend the present study by investigating the quark-mass
behavior of the pion mass, as well as of other mesons, or to study the continuum limit of
the chiral condensate. The latter would require an ambitious numerical effort, but also
a better theoretical characterization of finite-volume effects in the e-regime of the TEK
formulation of large-N QCD. Finally, it would be very interesting to extend the use of
the chiral lattice Dirac operator to other large-N gauge theories where chiral symmetry
breaking plays a crucial role, such as VW = 1 SUSY Yang-Mills, where the calculation of
the gluino condensate is of great theoretical interest.

Appendix
A The spectrum of the free overlap operator

In this Appendix we discus how to restore physical units in the lattice overlap operator D,
leading to the rescaling formulas presented in Eqs. (3.25)-(3.29).

Let us start by generically parameterizing the free massless overlap operator in Fourier
space by:

_ 1 + vires) (p)

1 B(p) +i WAn(P)
2 2

2(B%p) +, A200)

Do(p) (A.1)

From this formula one can easily check that the eigenvalues of the operator H? = Di Do,
with H = y5Dp, are given by:

| Be) (A2)

il
9 1/2°
2|[B?+ >, AR]

Moreover, making use of the Ginsparg- Wilson relation:
Doys + ¥5D0 = 2D075D0; (A.3)
and the fact that y5sDoy5 = Di, one can relate the eigenvalues of Do with 2 using that,

Do + Di = 2H?, (A.4)

21 =
therefore Re{A} = \?. Making use of the fact that the eigenvalues of Dp lie on a circle and
writing

e I ,
A= 5 (i+ e*), (A.5)
it is trivial to derive the form of the imaginary part of the eigenvalues, leading to:

\= Midi — 2. (A.6)

One can now specialize to the case of the overlap operator with kernel given by (3.20). For
this, one should first note that the spectrum of the free Wilson—Dirac operator 75Dw(—M)
in momentum space in the TEK formulation is identical to the standard one, defined on a

lattice of (VN ) sites. Using this, one can easily derive the expressions corresponding to
A, (p) and B(p) for the overlap kernel used in our work:

where s, = sin(ap,), 8? = on sin?(ap,) and 6? = op sin?(ap,,/2), with p, = 2rn,/VN,
Ny = O,+°° ,VN —1. These results agree with those quoted for the standard overlap
operator with identical kernel in Ref. [134].

Once we know the expressions for the eigenvalues, the scaling factor in Eq. (3.29) is
obtained by taking into account, for instance, that the eigenvalue corresponding to H? in
the continuum should be |p|?. The overall scaling factor is easily determined by taking the

limit of small ap, of A, which leads to:

ei, oP (A.9)
a>0 M2(2— M)2’

ie., the factor of M/(2 — M)/a appearing in Eqs. (3.25)—(3.29).
