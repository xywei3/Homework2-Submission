CRITICAL TEMPERATURES AND COLLAPSING OF TWO-DIMENSIONAL
LOG GASES

ROLF ANDREASSON & LUDVIG SVENSSON

ABSTRACT. We consider the canonical ensemble of a system of point particles
on the sphere interacting via a logarithmic pair potential. In this setting, we
study the associated Gibbs measure and partition function, and we derive explicit
formulas relating the critical temperature, at which the partition function diverges,
to a certain discrete optimization problem. We further show that the asymptotic
behavior of both the partition function and the Gibbs measure near the critical
temperature is governed by the same optimization problem. Our approach relies
on the Fulton—MacPherson compactification of configuration spaces and analytic
continuation of complex powers. To illustrate the results, we apply them to well-
studied systems, including the two-component plasma and the Onsager model of
turbulence. In particular, for the two-component plasma with general charges,
we describe the formation of dipoles close to the critical temperature, which we
determine explicitly.

1. INTRODUCTION

Consider the following interaction energy for N(> 2) point particles at positions
P1,---,PN on the unit sphere S?:

where d(-,-) denotes the chordal distance on S? and c(i,7j), for 1 < i < j < N, are
real numbers specifying the coupling between particles i and 7. The prototypical
example is c(i, j) = kikj, where k; represents the charge of particle 1.
We consider the corresponding canonical ensemble at inverse temperature 3. The
associated Gibbs measure on (S?)", when it exists, is given by

eral, there are critical values of 8 at which Z(() becomes infinite, causing the Gibbs
measure to cease to exist. This phenomenon is highly dependent on the logarithmic

singularity of the pair-interaction. In contrast, for Coulomb gases in other dimen-
sions, with singular pair-interaction governed by the corresponding Green’s function
to the Laplace equation, no similar behavior occurs; the Gibbs measure either exists
for all temperatures or for none.

This model encompasses several important and well-studied particle systems in
physics, including one- and two-component (and, more generally, n-component) plas-
mas on the sphere. Such two-dimensional plasmas, in various geometries, have been
proposed as simplified models for dimensionally reduced, translation-invariant three-
dimensional plasmas, see [19, 32]. Furthermore, the same framework also describes
systems of quasi-particles such as vortices. Vortices described by a Log gas arise in
several different contexts, including the Ginzburg-Landau model of superconductiv-
ity, see [29], the analysis of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition for the XY
model, see [21], and the Onsager model of turbulence for two-dimensional Eulerian
fluids, see, e.g., [25]. In the latter case, as well as in related quasi-particles systems
such as the guiding center plasma, see [11], both positive and negative values of
the inverse temperature are of interest. Hence, we will treat 6 as an arbitrary real
parameter.

Before presenting our results, we introduce two discrete optimization problems
that are central to all of them.

Problem 1.1. Given an integer N and real numbers c(i, j),1 < i < j < N, consider

the minimization problem

where S ranges over all subsets of {1,...,.N} of size at least two.

Problem 1.2. Given an integer N and real numbers c(i, j/),1 < i < j < N, consider

the maximization problem

where S ranges over all subsets of {1,...,.N} of size at least two.

Variants of these problems have appeared in the literature in other contexts, as
discussed in Section 7. Our first result is an explicit formula for the critical inverse
temperatures, given in terms of the optimization problems above.

certain effective divisor defined by c(i,7j), see (2.18) below. In this case, Proposi-
ion 1.3 resembles results in [33] and [22], and our proof roughly follows the proof in
33].

Solving Propositions 1.1 and 1.2 can be quite challenging in practice. Nevertheless,
Proposition 1.3 provides a direct way to find explicit upper bounds for 6* and lower
bounds for 6~ by simply evaluating the expression for any chosen subset S. By
relating these optimization problems to Rayleigh—Ritz quotients and the min-max
heorem for eigenvalues of symmetric matrices, we show in Proposition 4.1 how to
obtain bounds in the opposite, more difficult direction. The bounds are in terms
of eigenvalues of the symmetric matrix with entries c(i,j). This leads to stochastic
younds in a quenched, random version of the Log gas, considered, for example, in
20], where the couplings are assumed to be random variables. We consider both the
case of independent couplings, see Proposition 5.1, and that of independent charges,
see Proposition 5.2, which exhibit markedly different behavior.

The eigenvalue bounds also leads to the following explicit bounds in the key case
when c(i,j) = kikj, 1< i<j <N, for real numbers k;.

Corollary 1.4. Let c(i,j) = kikj, 1 < i<j <N for real numbers kj,1 <i< N. If

Our second result concerns the limiting behavior of the Gibbs measure jug as 8
approaches the finite endpoints of the interval (G~,@*). To state the result, we
first introduce some additional notation. Let G+ and G~ denote the sets of subsets

of {1,...,N} that realize the minimum in Proposition 1.1 and the maximum in
Proposition 1.2, respectively. That is,

sae C(t, 7
17) Gt = {SC {1,...,N}: |S] 22 and _ Zags AA oh

|S|-1
and similarly for G~. Following [14], we say that a collection K = {S,...,S,} of
distinct subsets of {1,...,N} is a nest if any two elements S;,5; € K are nested,

meaning that S$; C $;, S$; C S;, or S$; S; =. Let N+ and N~ denote the sets of
nests of Gt and G~, respectively, having maximal size «* and «~ among all nests
of Gt and G~.

Theorem 1.5. As 3 approaches one of the endpoints of the interval (8~, 8), if the
endpoint is finite, we have the following weak limits:

The weak convergence in Proposition 1.5 and the characterization of the support
of the limit implies that if U is an open set compactly contained in the complement
of (1.10) in (S?), then the probability that the system occupies U converges to zero
as 8 + 8*, and similarly as 8 approaches 8~. Thus, Proposition 1.5 describes the
collapse (or condensation) of the system as a critical temperature is approached, and
(1.10) and (1.11) specify the possible clusters formed in the limit. We find examples
where pairs are formed (see (1.16) below) and other examples displaying total collapse
of all particles into a single cluster (see Proposition 6.5 below).

A fundamental quantity in equilibrium statistical mechanics is the Gibbs free en-
ergy as a function of the inverse temperature (3, given in our setting by —1/N log Z({).
Our third result concerns the asymptotic behavior of the free energy as 3 approaches
the critical values 8+ and 8~. Recall that «* and «~ denote the sizes of the maximal
nests in G* and G™, respectively.

Theorem 1.6. The free energy admits the asymptotic behavior
1 Ke

w 08 2(8) = a

provided that B* is finite.

(1.12) log(8— 8+) +O(1) as B+ B*,

In fact, the proof provides a full asymptotic expansion of the free energy as 6
approaches (*:

a0
(1.13) x08 2(8) T log(6 — 6+) + CF + CEB — B*) + OF (6 - Bt)? +---.

This expansion follows from the fact that Z() admits a Laurent series expansion
about 6*, established via analytic continuation. Moreover, the order of the pole of
this Laurent series expansion is precisely k*. The coefficients Ce ; CF, ... can be
expressed in terms of the Laurent series coefficients; for instance, Cr = (log At) /N,
where Az is the coefficient of (6 — pt)-* in the expansion of Z({).

In particular, if Proposition 1.1 and/or Proposition 1.2 in Proposition 1.3 has a
unique solution, then «* and/or «~ is equal to 1, respectively. We also find examples
where the solution of Proposition 1.1 is highly degenerate, and «+ grows linearly with
N, see Section 1.2.1 below.

1.1. Comment on the proofs. The proofs of Propositions 1.3, 1.5 and 1.6 rely on the
identification of (S?)% with the complex algebraic variety (CP')’. The singularity
of the Gibbs measure corresponds to a well-studied singular subvariety of (CP!)¥.
To prove Proposition 1.3, we use the explicit embedded resolution of singularities of
this subvariety, provided by the Fulton—MacPherson compactification of the ordered
configuration space of CP! [14]. The proofs of Propositions 1.5 and 1.6 exploit the
distribution-valued meromorphic continuation of complex powers [2, 6].

1.2. Applications. We now highlight Propositions 1.3, 1.5 and 1.6 with some appli-
cations to well-studied systems of physical origin.
CRITICAL TEMPERATURES AND COLLAPSING OF TWO-DIMENSIONAL LOG GASES 5

1.2.1. Positive temperature. First, consider the general two-component plasma, in-
troduced in [17], for which

Zi<ij<sM

Z8,Ni <i,j<N

-MZ,1<5i1<M,M<jSNn

—Z)Zy,N, <i NA<j< Mi.

In this system there are two types of particles: Nj, particles of the first and No =
N — N, of the second. The first type of particle has charge Z, and the second
type has charge —Z2, where Z; and Zg are positive real numbers. Without loss of
generality, we assume Z, > Z. For simplicity (though this is not crucial), we also
assume overall charge neutrality, that is, Z)N, = ZN». In this case we are able to
solve Proposition 1.1 explicitly, and as a consequence of Theorems 1.3, 1.5 and 1.6,
we find the following.

Theorem 1.7. With c(i,7j) as in (1.14), we have
(1.15) 6 =1/(Z,2Z2),

and 1* is supported on

The support (1.16) can be understood as the union over all possible ways to pair up
positive and negative particles into a maximal number of pairs, of the corresponding
subsets describing these configurations. In light of Proposition 1.5, Proposition 1.7
shows rigorously the formation of dipoles as the critical inverse temperature Bt =
/(Z1Z2) is approached.

In the physics literature, see, e.g., [17], the critical inverse temperature [ =
2/(Z,Z2) can be found, which is consistent with (1.15) due to a difference in normal-
ization. To the authors’ knowledge, however, this formula has not yet been rigorously
proven, except when Z; = Zp [16].

In the recent work [8], dipole formation was established in the case Z; = Z. = 1
for 8 > BY =1/(Z,Z_) = 1, in the limit A > 0, where \ denotes a regularization
parameter. Moreover, a detailed asymptotic expansion of the free energy was ob-
ained. It would be of interest to derive an even more detailed asymptotic expansion
for both the free energy and Gibbs measure for a suitably regularized version of the
system when 6 > 1. The physics literature suggests that such an expansion should
include additional terms corresponding to the formation of neutral multipoles, be-
yond the leading order dipole contribution. As § is increased, terms corresponding
to increasingly larger neutral multipoles are expected to appear. In fact, in the very
recent work [9], such higher-order terms have been shown to appear. It is natural
to ask whether Proposition 1.1 is also related to these further transitions. We will
address this question in a sequel to the present work.

1.2.2. Negative temperature. Now, consider the coupling defined by
c(i, J) = kik,

where the kj are arbitrary nonzero real numbers. This model generalizes the two-
component plasma and arises, for example, as the statistical mechanical description
of the Onsager model of turbulence, with the k; representing the vorticities of the
point-vortex particles. Determining the positive critical inverse temperature explic-
itly seems difficult in general, although Proposition 1.3 and Proposition 1.4 provide
explicit upper and lower bounds.

Here, we instead focus on the negative-temperature regime, where imposing a
strong condition on the variation among the vorticities allows us to solve Proposi-
tion 1.2 explicitly, see Proposition 6.3. More precisely, the condition is that

3,
max k; < = min kj,
u:kjy>0 i:ki>0

and
3,

max |kj| << = min |kj|.

Uki<O 2 i:ki<O
In this case, we observe a fundamentally different qualitative behavior of the con-
densation as the critical temperature is approached. Unlike the positive-temperature
case (for the two-component plasma), where many small clusters are formed, here
one observes a total collapse of either all positively or all negatively charged particles,
depending on a simple criterion. See Proposition 6.3 below for details.

1.3. Other geometries. We have stated our result in the setting of the sphere for
simplicity, but we expect them to hold almost verbatim in a more general setting,
with similar proofs. For any Riemann surface M, compact or otherwise, with a
metric g and a volume form dV, one can consider an analogous energy E: MN > R
constructed from pair-interactions governed by the corresponding Greens function
G, defined with respect to g, where suitable boundary conditions are imposed if M
has a boundary. Specifically, the energy is given by

E(p1,..-,Pw) = >> eli, J) log G(pi,p5)-
i<j
Furthermore, one can allow the inclusion of a smooth external potential U: M — R,
and define the Gibbs measure as

Hp = a exp ( — B(E(pi,..-,pn) + » U(p)) daven

with

2(8) = I. exp ( — B(E(pi,...,pw) + » U(P:))) ave’

assuming the latter integral converges. We expect our results to hold in this setting,
more or less verbatim, as long as the possible failure of convergence of Z() arises
from the logarithmic short-range nature of the interaction term. That is, as long as
the integrability of exp (— @(E+ 52, U(p;))) dV® is equivalent to local integrability
in the interior of M%. One common setting is to take M to be a rectangle, g to be
the standard Euclidean metric, dV to be the standard Lebesgue measure and U = 0.

1.4. Outline of the Paper. In Section 2.1 we recall some notions from complex geom-
etry. In Section 2.2 we introduce a complex-geometric formalism and outline some
ideas that go into the proofs of Propositions 1.3 and 1.5. In Section 2.3 we recall the
Fulton—MacPherson compactification of configuration spaces. Section 3 contains the
proofs of the three main theorems. In Section 4 we relate Propositions 1.1 and 1.2 to
eigenvalue problems and prove Proposition 1.4. In Section 5 we use the eigenvalue
sounds to obtain bounds in the case of random couplings. In Section 6 we present
and prove the results related to the examples discussed in Section 1.2 above. Fi-
nally, in Section 7 we relate Propositions 1.1 and 1.2 to other discrete optimization
problems and point out connections to spin glass models.

2. PRELIMINARIES

2.1. Complex geometry. We begin this section by recalling some concepts from com-
plex algebraic geometry that are essential to the proofs of Propositions 1.3 and 1.5.
For more details, a good reference is [15].

2.1.1. Divisors. Let X be a complex manifold of dimension n. An (R-)divisor D on
X is a locally finite formal R-linear combination

D= > Vj,
j

where each V; C X is an irreducible analytic hypersurface. An analytic hypersurface
V is locally defined in an open set U C X as the zero set of a holomorphic function
g: U ->C. If f is a holomorphic function on X, its associated divisor is

Div(f) = So ordy(f)V,
Vv

where the sum runs over the irreducible components V of the hypersurface defined
by f, and ordy(f) is the order of vanishing of f along V. This construction allows
divisors to be pulled back via holomorphic maps. Specifically, if 7: Y - X isa
holomorphic map between complex manifolds and D = >> j ajVj is a divisor on X,
then

(2.1) m™(D) =) 7 ajn*(Vj),
a

where, locally, 7*(V;) = Div(a*(f;)) for any local defining function f; of V;. Finally,
for a divisor D = > n aj;V; on X, we define its support as the hypersurface

supp(D) := vj.
j

2.1.2. Blowups. Again, let X be a complex manifold of dimension n, and let Z Cc X
be a complex submanifold of codimension k > 1. The blowup of X along Z is a
complex n-dimensional manifold, denoted by Blz-X, together with a holomorphic
map 7: BlzX — X with the following local description: For any point p€ Y C X,
we can find a neighborhood B Cc X of p and holomorphic coordinates z = (21,..-, Zn)
centered around p such that, locally in B, Z = {z1 =+-++ = z_ = 0}. Then,

BlzB = {(z,[f]) € Bx CP*?: zit; = zjti, 1< i,j < kh,

where CP*-! denotes complex projective (k — 1)-space. Geometrically, the blowup
replaces Z with a space parameterizing the directions into Z relative to the space
8 ROLF ANDREASSON & LUDVIG SVENSSON

X, called the exceptional divisor E = x~'(Z). Locally, over B, the blowup map
a is the restriction of the natural projection B x CP*—! + B to the submanifold
BlzB c Bx CP*-!. By covering X with such coordinate charts, the local construc-
tions glue together to a complex manifold BlzX and a globally defined holomorphic
map 7: BlzX — X. The map 7 is a biholomorphism over X \ Z, that is, on the
complement of the exceptional divisor.

The space BlzX can be covered by k coordinate charts {Uj}h, corresponding to

the standard affine charts {t; # 0} C CPi for jf = Ay wn yke Th = (Bigs og By)

and y = (y1,--.,Yn) denote holomorphic coordinates in U; and Uj, respectively, then
the transition map is given by

yyy i l=i,
Vy; if C= j,

 Vuelyy POAGG, OS,
ye ifk+1<<n.
For each j = 1,...,k, the restriction of the blowup map to the coordinate chart U;
is given locally by
From (2.2), we see that for the pullback of the tuple (z1,..., 2;), there is locally always

one variable that divides the rest. These local functions define the exceptional divisor
of the blowup.

Let V C X be an analytic subvariety (reduced and irreducible). The strict trans-
form of V under the blowup 7: BlzX — X is defined by

Strict,(V) = a-1(V \ Z).
The preimage 7~!(V) is called the total transform of V. There is also a third notion,
interpolating between these two constructions, called the dominant transform. The

dominant transform of V with respect to 7 is defined as the strict transform whenever
V ¢ Z and the inverse image m—!(V) when V C Z.

Lastly, recall that for a complex manifold X and a Zariski-closed subset Z C X, an
embedded resolution of singularities of Z in X is a smooth manifold Xx together with
a holomorphic map 7: X3X , which is a composition of blowups along complex
submanifolds, such that the restriction X \~1(Z) 4 X\ Z is a biholomorphism and
such that 1-1(Z ) is a normal crossings hypersurface in X. Recall that a hypersurface
is said to have normal crossings if, locally, it is a union of coordinate hyperplanes.

2.1.3. The relative canonical divisor. Consider a holomorphic map F': Y — X which
is a biholomorphism between the complements of closed analytic subsets of Y and
X (for instance, a composition of blowups). The relative canonical divisor of F is
defined by

(2.3) Ky x ‘= Div(det Jac(F)),
where Jac(F) denotes the Jacobian matrix of F’, defined in local coordinates. In this

notation, the map F' is suppressed and should thus be clear from the context. As a
useful alternative, one can also define
CRITICAL TEMPERATURES AND COLLAPSING OF TWO-DIMENSIONAL LOG GASES 9

Here, Ky = div(s) for a holomorphic section s of the line bundle A” T* Y, and Kx is
defined similarly. Here, T* Y denotes the holomorphic cotangent bundle of Y. While
Ky and Kx are not uniquely defined as divisors (only as linear equivalence classes),
Ky,x is a well-defined divisor once Ky and Ky are chosen so that they coincide
where F is a biholomorphism. This choice will be made implicitly throughout.

As an example, if 7: BlzX — X is the blowup of X along Z, then

(2.5) Kpi,x/x = (codim(Z) — 1)B,

where £ is the exceptional divisor, as is seen from (2.2).
A useful property, which follows from (2.4), is that for two maps Fp: Yo > Y; and
F,: ¥; + X as above, one has

(2.6 Kyy/x = Kyyjy, + F2(Kyx);

for the relative canonical bundle of the composition F, o Fh: Yy > X. Note that
(2.6) also follows directly from the chain rule for Jacobians applied to (2.3).

2.1.4. Pulling back measures with analytic singularities. Now, let X be a complex
manifold of dimension n, and let D = > F, ajV; be a divisor on X. Suppose we have
a measure 4. on X that locally takes the form

(2.7 w= [If vdaa---A din,
j

where f; is a locally defining function of V;, and WV is a smooth, nowhere-vanishing
function. If F: Y + X is a holomorphic map that is a biholomorphism between the
complements of closed analytic subsets Z C Y and W Cc X, then, locally on Y \ Z,

(2.8) p= Il |9;\° F*(Y) Il |hjP?% dzr A+++ A din,
J

J

where F*(D) = Da bjS; and S; = {g; = 0} locally, and Ky;x = I]; cj Kj and
Kj = {hj = 0} locally. The formula (2.8) follows from the change of variables
formula for integrals, together with the definitions (2.1) and (2.3). Since ys does
not put any mass on W, p(U) = F*py(F*(U \ W)) for any measurable U C Y. By
extending F* by zero over Z, we even have p(U) = F*p(F*(U)) for any measurable

U.

2.2. Complex geometric formalism. In this section we introduce a complex geometric
formalism for the N-particle system on the sphere. We begin by identifying S? with
the Riemann sphere C U {00} or, equivalently, the complex projective line ce!. On
the standard affine chart (C) c (CP!)% with coordinates (z1,..., 2), the energy
in (1.1) can be written as

I|zi — 2y||? = |zi — 24|? exp(—(zi) — 4(z;))
10 ROLF ANDREASSON & LUDVIG SVENSSON

and where | - | denotes the standard absolute value on C. The function ¢(z) =
log(1 + |z|?) is the Kahler potential for the Fubini-Study metric on CP!. Note that

dV(z%) =

dz; A dz; = exp(—2¢(z)) 5 dz; A dz;.

Letting

(2.9) ®(a,...,2v) = — D> eli, 9)(O(zi) + 0(2;)),

the Gibbs measure then takes the form

where the partition function Z() is given by
(2.10) 2(B) = [ ; Il la— 2; [798 exp(—8®) aves,
JON 55
It suffices to integrate over C¥, since this affine chart is dense in (CP')’. On the
remaining standard affine charts covering the reorderings of {0}* x {oo}‘—* for any

after possibly reordering the variables. Note that the Gibbs measure is of the type
(2.7) in Section 2.1.4.

The partition function is convergent only on a (possibly empty) interval or ray
(8-, 8+) CR, depending on the couplings c(i, j) and on N, and divergent otherwise.
For any @ € R, the local integrands in (2.10) and (2.11) are locally integrable outside

When c(i,7) € Q4 for each i 4 j, (2.12) is an example of an Archimedean local
zeta function, see, e.g., [18]. Note that, for B € (87, 87), (2.12) defines a distribution
on all of (CP!)%. This perspective of viewing the partition function as a distribution
in the above sense is useful in relation to Proposition 1.5, which concerns the weak
limit of the Gibbs measure j1g as we approach the critical inverse temperatures. Note
that, for 8 € (8~, 87),

CRITICAL TEMPERATURES AND COLLAPSING OF TWO-DIMENSIONAL LOG GASES 11

If we allow for complex values of the inverse temperature 8, then 2(8) defines a
distribution on (CP!) for any in the vertical strip Q = {8 © C: B— < ReB < Br}.
Moreover, Z§(3) is holomorphic as a function of 6 in 9. By a classical result,
originally due to Bernstein and Gelfand in [6] and independently Atiyah in [2], 2§(3)
has a meromorphic continuation to all of Cg with poles in a discrete subset of Q, for
any test function €. This classical result applies when c(i,7) € Q:, but as we show
below, a version of it extends to our more general setting of mixed signs.

In particular, 8~ and 6+ will be among the possible poles of Z£(8). Thus, we can
consider the Laurent series expansion of Z§(8) about 8~ (and, similarly, about 8+),

248) = S> ae(8-B-Y,
l>-k
where 0 < « < N. The leading order coefficient c_,, viewed as a function of €,
defines a positive distribution, that is, a measure, on (CP!)%. This measure, up to
normalization, is equal to the weak limit of the Gibbs measure jig as 8 + B~, see
the proof of Proposition 1.5.

Let us consider the simplest possible example, when there are only two particles.

It is clear that B* = 00, since c > 0, and that 8~ = —1/c. Moreover, as 8 approaches

When N > 3, that is, for three or more interacting particles, the situation is more
involved than in Proposition 2.1. The main difficulty arises from the fact that the
singular locus of the integrand is not a normal crossings hypersurface. Consider an
integral of the form

(2.14) I(8) = wf | 21 |2@Gar+61) tee | 24_| 2G ae tOe) € dey Adz, A\---dzn A dn,

whose singular set is the normal crossings hypersurface {21 ---z,; = 0}. In this case,
one can repeat the arguments of Proposition 2.1 in each variable separately (cf. the
proof of Proposition 1.5) to find the weak limit of the Gibbs measure. For N > 3,
however, Z§() is not locally of the form (2.14). Nevertheless, it turns out that we
can reduce to this situation by pulling back the integral defining Z‘() via a suitable
holomorphic map. We showcase this for N = 3 with the following example.
12 ROLF ANDREASSON & LUDVIG SVENSSON

Example 2.2. Let us fix N = 3 and assume for simplicity that c(i,j7) > 0 for
each i # j. Just as in Proposition 2.1, we then have that Bt = oo. In the
standard affine subspace C? c (CP!)?, we can write dV®? = if dz A dz, where
f =(t)8 exp(-2 iy (2), (2) = log(1+|z;|?) and where dzA dz = dz Adz, A
dzq A dz A dzg \ dz3. Consider the change of variables

WI =%-— 22, Wa=2%2- 23, W3 g (41 + 22 + 23),

which satisfies dw \ dw = dz A dz. For Re GB > 0, and for any test function €, we
have that

To determine 8~, we first address the fact that

{w) = 0} U {wy = 0} U {w, + we = 0}
is not a normal crossings hypersurface. To remedy this, we consider the blowup
a: BlwC? + C3 along the locus W = {w, = w2 = 0}. The space BlyC? can be
covered by two coordinate charts, and the blowup map 7 can be described explicitly

on each. More precisely, there exists an open covering {U1, U2} of BlwC® such that,
in local holomorphic coordinates

(#1,%2,03) on Uy ~C’, (y1,Y2,¥3) on Ur ~C%,
the transition relations on U; M U2 are given by
T=yr, t2=1/y, 13 = ys.
The blowup map can be written locally as
m(x1,€2,03) = (21,01%2,%3) inj, — m(yi,¥2,Y3) = (y2¥1, 2,43) in Ud,
cf. (2.2). In the chart U1, we have

With more work, following Proposition 2.1, one can also deduce the leading asymp-
totics of the Gibbs measure and the partition function using this blowup construction.
CRITICAL TEMPERATURES AND COLLAPSING OF TWO-DIMENSIONAL LOG GASES 13

Reducing to the case (2.14) can be done locally, for general N, by means of an
embedded resolution of singularities of the pair ((CP!)", D). In our setting, there
is an explicit construction of such a resolution for arbitrary N, due to Fulton anc
MacPherson [14]; see the following section for details.

Remark 2.3. The techniques of this paper extend naturally to other Gibbs measures,
for instance to variants of Log gases on higher-dimensional varieties X. Centra.
o the proofs of Propositions 1.3 and 1.5 is the meromorphic continuation of the
partition function as a distribution-valued function of 6, a general version of which
can be found in [31]. The applicability of the Fulton—MacPherson compactification,
which provides an explicit embedded resolution of singularities, relies on the fact tha
1e singularities of the integrand of the partition function are supported on the big
liagonal U,- jl%i = 2;} C XN, which is typically the case for pairwise interactions.
A related result for Koba—Nielsen string amplitudes over an arbitrary local field o:
characteristic zero, which closely resemble partition functions of Log gases, can be
‘ound in [7].

2.3. The Fulton—MacPherson compactification of configuration space. In [14], Fulton
and MacPherson introduce a remarkable compactification of the configuration space
of a nonsingular algebraic variety. Given a nonsingular algebraic variety X and a
natural number N, they construct a nonsingular algebraic variety X (N] along with a
proper map 7: X IN] _» X"_ The map 7 restricts to an isomorphism over the open
subset X% \ Vic; Wij} where Wy; is the diagonal {(a1,..,7) € XN 2 a; = x5},
that is, 7 is an isomorphism outside of the degenerate configurations where at least
two particles coincide. Moreover, m—1(Uj;< 5 W,.,;3) is a normal crossings divisor in

XII. For simplicity, we will assume that X has complex dimension 1, since our
application concerns X = CP!.

The construction of Xl] is somewhat involved, but it can be constructed as a
sequence of blowups my ,where W ranges over the set of subvarieties

(2.15) G:={{we XN: a, =--- =a}: 1 <i <--+< ip < Nk =2,...,N}

of X, see below. It is convenient to identify G with the set G of subsets of {1,..., N}
of size at least two, via {i1,...,in} < {aj, =--- = a, }. We write Wg € G for the

subvariety corresponding to the subset S € G under this bijection. We also denote
by G; the subset of G consisting of elements

with i1,...,¢r <j.

For the reader’s convenience, we briefly recall the construction of X WI, in the
anguage of [36]. The variety X IN] is obtained inductively through a sequence of
slowups. Starting from a variety Y, isomorphic to X In] x XN—", one constructs
a new variety Y,41 isomorphic to X!"+!] x XN-(@+1) is constructed. This process
begins with Y; = X [1] x XN-1 = XN and terminates with Yn = X [N], Moreover,
his construction yields a factorization

For each n > 1, the space Y,,41 is obtained from Y,, by a sequence of blowups. More
precisely, we define

2.17) Tn+1 = TMnt+1,n +++ O° TWn+1,1: Ynti = Yn+1n ute Yn+1,0 Yn,
14 ROLF ANDREASSON & LUDVIG SVENSSON

where, for each 1 < k < n, the map mp+1,, is the iterated blowup along the iter-
ated dominant transforms (with respect to all preceding blowups 72,1, 73,1, 73,2,--+
Tn+1jls+++sTn+1,k—1) Of all of W € Gry with codim(W) = n+1—k. These subvari-
eties are all pairwise disjoint, so the order of the blowups at this stage is irrelevant.
For a given W € G, we denote by W"t!* the iterated dominant transform of W
under the maps 7,,¢ with 1<m<nand1<¢<>k, so that Wrttk co Yn+1k-

Each iterated blowup 7;,; gives rise to collection of exceptional divisors, which we
denote by EY For any m > j and ¢> k, we denote by Eee the strict transform of
these divisors with respect to all subsequent blowups up to level m, @. We include in
this notation also the blowups along subvarieties of codimension 1; although these are
isomorphisms, they nevertheless give rise to exceptional divisors, namely themselves,
which simplifies the notation.

On X!"l x XN—" we write Et noe. and finally on X/] we denote Ew =
BN which is defined for every W € G. In fact, the preimage of U;
m is precisely the union of these divisors:

By [14], m7 "(Uj j W,,j}) has normal crossings. Hence, 7 is an embedded resolution

The relative canonical divisor

where Ey is the exceptional divisor corresponding to W € G.

Proof. The proof proceeds by induction on n, using repeatedly the formula for the
relative canonical bundle of a blowup (2.5) together with the chain rule (2.6). As a
base case, take N = 2. Since (CP!)?! = (CP*)?, K(cptyeij(cpt)2 = 9. Moving on to
the induction step, first, we introduce some notation. Recall that

Gn = {Ws: SN{n+1,...,N} =9, |S| > 2}.
Thus,

Gn+i\ Gn ={Ws: SN{n+1,...,N}={n+ 1}, |S] > 2}.
Recall the iterated blowup construction of (CP!)!%] described above, and define
Tp] = Mn 0++0 772: Yn 9+ 2 YQ OV = (cP),

where

Tj = Mj 5-107 O51 YG = Vij + 9 Via > Yj0 = Yj-1,
and where 7.4: Yj,4 — Yj,,-1 is the iterated blowup along the iterated dominant
transforms (with respect to the previous blowups 72,1, 73,1, 73,2, ---;Tj,ls--+> j,k-1)
of all W € G; with codimW = j—k. Thus, the Fulton-MacPherson compactification
is obtained as 7 := my]: (CP!)IM] + (CP).
For the induction hypothesis, suppose that

To proceed, we recall the following fact from [14, Proposition 3.4]:
(2.24) ma x(Eye) = Bye

(2.25) ma e(Ey |) = By + yy

where W! = Wy with S’ = SU {n}.

where, in the last step, we use that W"* has codimension 2 whenever codim(W) > 1

S> (codim(W) = 1)r% (Ei) = S2 (codim(W) — 1) (Rt! + yh")

where W’ is given by Ws where S’ = SU {n} and W = Wg.

In view of the bijection between G and G, the above result can be written as

3. PROOFS OF THE MAIN THEOREMS

Proof of Proposition 1.3. Let +: (CP!)!N] — (CP!)% be as in Section 2.3, that is,
it arises from the Fulton-MacPherson compactification of the configuration space
of CP!. Since m restricts to a biholomorphism over (CP!) \ D, and since D =
Uje j Wei5} has codimension 1, the finiteness of the partition function (1.3) is reduced
to the integrability of the measure

extended by zero on (CP!)IN l, The map 7 being an embedded resolution of sin-

gularities of U;.; Wrijy C (CP!) implies that we can cover (CP!)I] with coor-
dinate charts on which the hypersurface supp(7*(D)) U supp(K (cpt yix /(CP*) x) =
supp(7*(D)) has normal crossings. Thus, for any such chart U, we can find holo-

morphic coordinates w = (wy,...,Wn) such that

locally in U, where 0 < k < N, ag and by are real numbers, dV® is a volume
form on U and © is (locally) defined by (2.9). For any @ = 1,..,k, the hypersurface
{we = 0} on U corresponds to the restriction to U of Ew for some W € G, or,
equivalently, to some Es for S € G. By definition, ag is the coefficient in front of
Ew in (2.19) in Proposition 2.4. Similarly, by is the coefficient in front of Ew in
2.22) in Proposition 2.5, cf. Section 2.1.4. Thus, ag = lief: We} 2W c(i, 7) and
be = codim(W) — 1 by Propositions 2.4 and 2.5. The finiteness of the partition
function reduces to the inequalities

3.2) 28 Sci, f) + 2(codim(W) — 1) > -2,
i<j:
Weij32W

1at should hold for all W € G. In terms of the bijection to subsets of {1,..., N},
1e finiteness is equivalent to the inequalities

26 S> c(i, j) +2(|$| — 2) > -2,

i<jEeS

1at should hold for all S C {1,...,.N} of size at least 2. These inequalities corre-
spond to lower or upper bounds for 6 depending on whether }7,- jes c(i, j) is positive
or negative. The sharp bounds that characterize finiteness are then given in terms
of optimization problems over subsets of size at least 2 of {1,...,.N}, corresponding
precisely to Problem 1.1 and Problem 1.2, yielding the statement.

The idea behind the proof of Proposition 1.5 is to show that, for any test function
€, Z§(8) defined in (2.12) admits a meromorphic continuation to neighborhoods of
he critical values 6* and 8~. We then analyze the Laurent series expansions of
2§(8) about these points. When all coupling coefficients c(i, 7) are positive integers,
he existence of such an expansion, particularly in a local setting, is a classical result
of Atiyah [2] and Bernstein—Gelfand [6], with several known generalizations. In our
setting, we provide a direct proof that follows closely the classical arguments.

18 ROLF ANDREASSON & LUDVIG SVENSSON

Proof of Proposition 1.5. We divide proof into three steps. In Step 1, we show that
Z5(B) admits a meromorphic continuation to all of C, with a discrete set of poles
along the real line. This is a slight variation of a classical result, and the techniques
involved in this part of the proof are standard. In Step 2, we show that the lowest-
order nonvanishing coefficient in the Laurent expansion of 2*(3) about $* defines the
action of a positive measure on the test function €. Furthermore, we show that the
weak convergence of the Gibbs measure as 3 > (+ follows from this fact. Lastly, in
Step 3, we determine the support of the limiting measure. We prove Proposition 1.5
for 8 + 67; the case 8 — 8* is completely analogous and, in fact, follows from the
proof for 8 > 8 by replacing 6 with —(.

Step 1: Z‘(3) has a meromorphic continuation to all of C.

Let 7: (CP*)!N) — (CP!)% be the Fulton-MacPherson compactification. In partic-
ular, the divisor supp(7*(D_)) Usupp(K cpt) (cptyw) has normal crossings. Recall,
from the proof of Proposition 1.3, that we can find an open cover of (CP), where,
in each chart, the pullback of the Gibbs measure takes the form (3.1). Let {Uj} be
such a cover of supp 7*é € (CP?)!9], and let {pj} be a partition of unity subordinate
to this cover. For B- < Re 8 < B+, it then follows that Z§({) is a finite (since 7 is
proper) sum of integrals of the form

volume form on (CP!)II, Suppressing the dependence on the chart U; in the notation
in the sequel, if k = 0, then J(8) is defined and holomorphic for all 8 € C, so we
can assume that k > 1. Moreover, without loss of generality, we may assume that

ay,...,a¢ > 0 and agyi,...,a% < 0, for some 1 < 0 < k, and then, in view of (3.3),
conclude that [(3) is defined and holomorphic for

Note that if a; > 0 for each j, then the upper bound in (3.5) is oo, and similarly, if
aj <0 for each j, then the lower bound is —oo.

We want to show that J(8) has a meromorphic continuation to all of Cg. The
classical idea is to consider the following Bernstein-Sato type relations

This implies that 2(8) has a meromorphic continuation to all of Cg, with poles

Step 2: The weak convergence of jug.

From the previous step we know that, for any test function €, 2§(@) extends
o a meromorphic function on all of Cg, hence we can consider its Laurent series
expansion. For 3 in a neighborhood of 6~ we have that

where (v;(8—),€) denotes the j** order Laurent series coefficient. Here we take K to
ye the maximum over all test functions € of the order of the pole of Z§(8) at B-.
This is possible since, in view of Step 1 and (3.8) in particular, the order of the pole
of Z§ at 87, for any €, is at most 2N. As aforementioned, and as we will see below,

v_3(B-): > (v5(B7), €)

is a distribution on (CP!)% for each j7. Thus, « can equivalently be defined as the
unique positive integer such that v_,(8~) # 0 and v_;(@~) = 0 for each j < —k.

If B~ < Re < B*, such that Z() is finite, we can consider the action (jg, €) of

which clearly converges to (v_,;(87),€)/(v_«(87), 1), as 8 > B7, as long as the de-
nominator (v_,(87), 1) #0. Given that v_,,(87) is a measure, then the denominator

jug towards the measure v_,,(8~)/(v_,(37), 1).

From (3.18), in view of (3.4) and (3.15), we see that if the test function € is (strictly)
positive, then limg_,4~ (6 — B-)"1(B) is (strictly) positive. Indeed, the integrand on
the right-hand side of (3.18) is generically positive and vanishing only on a set of
positive codimension in {w, = --- = we, = 0}.

Now, recall that « was defined as (the maximum over all test functions € of) the
order of the pole of Z§(8) at 8~. Thus, there exists a test function € such that

(v-n(B-),€) = lim (8 — B-)*Z8(B) £0.

b> B-

Moreover, & > ¢, with ¢; as above. Clearly, limg_,,-(8 — 8~)*I(8) = 0 unless
¢; = «. Consequently, since (3.18) (with ¢; = «) provides a local description of the
non-vanishing contributions to (v_,,(87),€), it follows that v_,(87) is a non-trivial
measure, proving the claim. Hence, (v_,(37), 1) > 0 and that the weak limit in (1.9)
from the statement of Proposition 1.5 exists. Its action on a test function € defined
on (CP!)" is that of a positive measure ji~, defined on the Fulton-MacPherson
compactification (CP!)!"], acting on the pulled-back test function 7*€, that is,

(u"s6) = im (1496) = (m8) = (mall 8),

where the last equality is by definition of the pushforward of distributions with respect
to proper maps.

Step 3: The support of ~.

What is left is to determine the support of ~. To this end, let us first understand
the support of ji on (CP')!]. From (3.18) it is evident that 7i~ is supported on a
union of certain intersections of irreducible hypersurfaces on (CP1)II, More precisely,
these hypersurfaces appear in either the support of 7*(D-) and, from Section 2.3,
any such hypersurface corresponds to a divisor Eg for some S € G.

We write

T"(De) = D> asEs,
Seq

Kepymeryy = >, bs Es.

(3.19)

Recall that G~ is the subset of G consisting of sets S for which ag > 0 and B~ =
(1+ bs)/as. From (3.18) we see that ~ is supported on the union of the maximal
intersections of the divisors Eg with S € G~. These intersection are maximal in the
sense of having the maximal possible codimension. By Proposition 2.6, Es,,..., Es,

intersect if and only if Si,..., Sj are pairwise nested; recall that S$; and S; are nested

if either S; C Sj, $; CS; or S;.S; =. Thus, the support of ji~ is given by

Pi,---,Pn). That such a q exists is easiest to see via the description in [14] of
CP')I] using screens, which is a convenient way to understand (CP!)!%] as a set.
If pi,...,pn are all distinct, the fiber of 7 over (pi1,...,pn) consists of a single
point. Otherwise, an arbitrary point in the fiber is described by the following data.
For each maximal collection of two or more indices 71,..., 7% such pj, = --+ = pi,, one
associates a screen to the set {7),...,7,}, that is, a tuple q,...,q, of k points in the
angent space T;, Pi CP!, not all coinciding; this data is only prescribed up to transla-

hat de, = +++ = %,, one specifies an additional screen associated to {i,,,...,tn,},
consisting of £ points in the tangent space T; ey (Tp,, CP"), not all coinciding, up to

In this picture, for S = {i1,...,ix}, the divisor Eg corresponds to the locus of
points in (CP!)I%] whose description includes a screen associated to the indices
i1,...,%%- From this description, it is evident that the required choice of g¢ € Use kes

Proposition 1.6, about the asymptotics of the partition function close to the critica.
inverse temperatures, is a consequence of the meromorphic continuation of Z(8) anc
its structure at B+.

Proof of Proposition 1.6. Consider the Laurent series expansion of 2§(8) about 6 =
87 in (3.10) with € = 1:

2°() = (8-87) *(v-n(B-),1) +O(B- 8) **),
24 ROLF ANDREASSON & LUDVIG SVENSSON

where « is defined in Step 2 of the proof of Proposition 1.5. Thus,

— 5; low(2(8)) = © tow(8 — B-) ~ Flos (v-«(8-), 1) + OB - B-))
K _ 1 _ it =
=F log(8 — 8) — Slog((v-n(3~), 1)) — = log (1+ 0(8 - 8-))

= 7 log(8 - 8-) +000),

as 6 > B-. The asymptotics as 6 > 8* follows analogously.

It remains to show that k = «. Recall from the proof of Proposition 1.5 that
« equals the maximal number of simultaneously intersecting divisors E in (CP),
where FE is an irreducible component of supp(m*(D)) U supp((cp1yixi (cpt) ) Such
that the coefficients a and b in front of E in (2.22) and (2.19), respectively, satisfy
—(1+ 6)/a = B-. As noted above, these divisors are in bijection with subsets
SC {1,...,N} that solve Proposition 1.2. Moreover, by Proposition 2.6, two or
more of these divisors intersect if and only if the corresponding sets are nested, cf. the
definition preceding Proposition 1.5. Consequently, « is the maximal cardinality of a
collection of nested subsets solving Proposition 1.2, which is precisely the definition
of «~. An analogous argument shows that the order of the pole of Z(8) at B+ equals

Kt .

4. BOUNDS ON THE CRITICAL INVERSE TEMPERATURES IN TERMS OF
EIGENVALUES

Recall that Propositions 1.1 and 1.2 are optimization problems over subsets S
of {1,...,.N} of size at least two. We can represent such a subset by a vector
x € {0,1}, where yi = 1 if i € S and x; = 0 otherwise. Let C denote the
symmetric N x N matrix with entries c(i,j) for i < j, c(j,i) for i > 7 and zeros on
the diagonal. With these identifications

Dicyes I) 1 xT
|S|—1 2xTx-1

(4.1)

The right-hand side is closely related to a Rayleigh-Ritz quotient, which allows us
to obtain bounds on the critical temperatures in terms of the eigenvalues of C.
Proposition 4.1. Suppose that B* is finite. Then

(4.2) B* > -1/Amin(C),

where Amin(C) is the smallest eigenvalue of C. Similarly, if B~ is finite, then

(4.3) BO < —-1/Amax(C),

where Amax(C) is the largest eigenvalue of C.

Proof. Recall that

Assume that T* > 0, that is, there exist S Cc {1,...,N} such that |S| > 2 and

where in the last step we use the min-max theorem for eigenvalues of a symmetric
matrix and Amin(C) is the smallest eigenvalue of C. By Proposition 1.3 we obtain
the bound Bt > —1/Amin(C).

A completely analogous argument shows that if T~ < 0, then B~ < 1/Amax(C
where Amax(C) is the largest eigenvalue of C.

In the case c(i, j) = kik; for each i ¥ j, letting k; be the components of a vector k
we have C = kk™ —diag(k)? where diag(k) is the N x N matrix with entries k; along
the diagonal and zeros otherwise. This is quite useful in relation to Proposition 4.1
since the only two eigenvalues of kk? are ||k||? and 0. Using the Weil inequalities

Amax(A + B) < Amax(A) + Amax(B),

for symmetric matrices A and B we prove Proposition 1.4 from the introduction,
Section 1.4.

Proof of Proposition 1.4. The first bound, (1.5), follows directly from Proposition 4.1
and

Amin(C) = Amin(kkT — diag(k)?) > Amin(KkT) + Amin(—diag(k)?) max k?.

a

The second bound, (1.6), follows directly from Proposition 4.1 and

Amax(C) = Amax(kkT — diag(k)?) < Amax(Kk7) + Amax(—diag(k)”) = ||k||? — min k?.

5. RANDOM COUPLING

In general, Problems 1.1 and 1.2 are not tractable to solve. However, an interesting
special case to consider is when c(i,j) are random variables. We will look at the
following two cases: When the particles have independent random couplings, and
when they have independent random charges.

5.1. Random coupling. Let us first assume the couplings c(i, 7) are ii.d. standard
normal random variables. In this setting, the bounds in Proposition 4.1 lead to
stochastic bounds using the well known distributions of the maximal eigenvalue of
the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE).
26 ROLF ANDREASSON & LUDVIG SVENSSON

Proposition 5.1. Let c(i,j) be independent, normally distributed random variables
with mean 0 and variance 1/N, for each l1<i<j<N. Then

(5.1) T* <2
almost surely, and

(5.2) T >-2
almost surely.

Proof. Let C' be, as above, the random N x N symmetric matrix with zeros on the
diagonal and off-diagonal entries given by the random variables c(i, j) for i < 7 and
i> Jj. Define C :=C+2D where D isa diagonal matrix with iid. standard normal
entries d;. Note that

P(Tt > 0) =1-05NA-Y? 1 as N00,

since T+ > 0 as soon as c(i, j) < 0 for some pair (i,7). Assuming T* > 0, so that
Proposition 4.1 applies, the Weil inequality yields

The first term on the right-hand side, —\min(C), corresponds to the largest eigenvalue
of a GOE random matrix. To leading order, its expectation equals 2 and its variance
scales as AN~1/3, where A > 0 [37].

The second term, —2Amin(D), can be written as io max(d;). This quantity is well
studied in extreme value theory, and by, e.g., [38, Example 1.1.7], to leading order,
both its expectation and variance grow as A’,/log(V) for some positive constant A’.
Consequently,

Tt <2 almost surely.

The analysis for T~ is carried out analogously.

Note that, by definition, T* < 2 does not exclude that T* < 0 which implies
B* =o. However, as stated in the above proof, the probability of this event tends
to zero as N — oo.

5.2. Random charges. Another natural random model is to consider random, inde-
pendent charges instead of random, independent coupling parameters. This setup
has been studied, for instance, in [20]. It appears particularly natural in the context
of the Onsager model of turbulence, where, to the best of the authors’ knowledge,
there is no canonical ansatz for the vorticities of the vortex particles. In this case,
Proposition 1.4 yields corresponding stochastic bounds.

Proposition 5.2. Let ki, fori =1,...,N, be i.i.d. standard normal random variables
and let c(i,j) = kikj. Then we have the stochastic bounds Tt < Cy andT~ > C_,
where

2(C, — log(N) + log log(N)/2 + log(['(1/2)) + A,

such that |Si| = |S9| = 1, where S$; = SN{1,..., Ni} and S, =SN{N,+1,...,N}.

max
|s|>2

To prove Proposition 6.1, we will make use of the following technical lemma.

Lemma 6.2. For Z € [1,00) and integers a,b of the form a = 2k—1, b = 2¢—1 where
(k,l) € Zao \ {(0,0)}, we have either that

(6.2) |Za —b| > Z—-(a+b-1)
or that

(6.3) a+b>Z+1.
28 ROLF ANDREASSON & LUDVIG SVENSSON

Proof. Assume first Za—b > 0. If b > 1, then a > 1. If b = —1, then by assumption
a> 1. In either case we have that

Za—b>Z—(a+b-1).

Consider now the case when Za — b < 0. If a = —1, then, by assumption, b > 1,
whence

Za—b Z—b+(a+1) <-Z—b+(a+1) +2(b- 1) Z+(a+b-1),

and (6.2) follows.
Ifa>1, then Z < Za<b<a+b—-1.SoZ+1<a+b.

Proof of Proposition 6.1. Starting from (6.1) we have

b = 2|S9| — 1. Note that |S] = |.$;| +|S2| = (a+ b)/2+1. Note also that Z, a and b
satisfy the conditions of Proposition 6.2. We divide the argument into two cases.

Case 1: Suppose a+b > Z+1. We have that

since Z > 1. We see that for equality to hold in the last inequality, we need Z = 1.
But then the assumption a+b > Z+1 becomes 2|$| > 3, which can never be sharp.

Case 2: Suppose that a+b < Z+1. By Proposition 6.2 we then have that |Za—b| >
Z—(a+b) +1. It follows that

Z|S|/2+ (Z —1)?/8 — (Z — 2|S| +. 3)?/8
|S|—1 ,

where in the last step we used that (a + b) = 2|S| — 2. Rewriting the numerator on
the right-hand side,

2|S|/2 + (Z— 1)?/8 — (Z — 2S] + 3)?/8 = (|S| — 1)(4 — (S| — 2)/2),
we find that

~ Micjes lt 3) az A Se:

|S|-1 7

For equality to hold in the last inequality, we must have that |S| = 2. For equality
to hold overall, we must have that

\Za—bl=Z—(a+b)4+1
|Z(2|S1| — 1) — (2|S2|—1)| = 2-1.
If |S,| = 2 and Sy = 0, the above becomes
3Z41=Z-1,

which has no solution in [1, 00). If S; = @ and || = 2, we obtain
Z2+3=Z-1,
which has no solution for any Z. This leaves only one remaining possibility, namely

S| = |S2| = 1, which we already saw attains the maximum. This concludes the
proof.

We are now ready to prove Proposition 1.7.

Proof of Proposition 1.7. For a general two-component plasma model, defined by
1.14) with Z,, Z2 € (0,00), we may assume, without loss of generality, that Z. < Z;.
Then, by making the change of variable 8 = 238, and letting Z := Z/Zs € [1, 00),
we reduce to the setting of Proposition 6.1, whence B+ = 1/Z = Z2/Z,. Changing
oack to 8, we immediately find that B+ = 1/Z Zo.

From the proof of Proposition 6.1 we also see that G~ consists of sets S with
exactly two elements, i and j, where i < N; and j > Ni + 1, corresponding to one
particle of each charge. Thus, \V~ consists of collections K of subsets of {1,...,.N}
of size N; where each subset in K has two elements, one at most Nj and one at least
Ni +1. It follows that ht = N| = N/(1+2Z/Z) where the last equality is due to
overall charge balance.

30 ROLF ANDREASSON & LUDVIG SVENSSON

6.2. Negative temperature. Recall the general coupling defined by
(6.4) ct, J) = kiky,

for nonzero real numbers k;. Without loss of generality, we assume that k; > 0 for
i=1,...,N, and k; < 0 fori = Ni +1,...,No where Nj + No = N. To be able to
solve Proposition 1.2, we put a strong assumption on the charges k;, namely that

(6.5 max kj <= min kj,
i: kj>O 2: kj>0

and that

(6.6 max |k;|< = min |kjj.
i: ki<O 2 i: ki<O
We will also assume that N > 2 to avoid the degenerate case c(1,2) < 0.

Corollary 6.3. Let c(i,7j) be given by (6.4), and assume that the conditions (6.5) and

have the same sign. To see this, assume, without loss of generality, that )7;-¢ ki = 0,
and that ky < 0. Then, clearly, k, Dies\{y ki, < 0.

Assuming further that max;:4,50 |ki| < 3 minj-4,>0 |ki| and similarly for the case of

the maximum number of elements possible for which all ks with i € S' have the same

Example 6.4. If the bounds (6.5) and (6.6) on the relative sizes of the kj are not
assumed, then the conclusion of Proposition 6.3 need not hold. For instance, consider
the case N = 3 with ky = a, ko =a, k3 = 1. Then

32 ROLF ANDREASSON & LUDVIG SVENSSON

Remark 6.5. If k; = k € R for each i = 1,...,N, then the bounds (6.5) and (6.6)
hold. By Proposition 6.3, the support of jz~ is then given by {p; = --- = py}.
In other words, total collapse occurs as the negative critical inverse temperature is

approached.

Remark 6.6. For kj = \/2/(N — 1), Proposition 6.3 yields 8~ = —1+1/N, in
agreement with [3] and [13]. In this case, limy_,.,—87 is precisely the 7-invariant

7. RELATIONS TO OTHER OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS

7.1. Arboricity of a graph. As in previous sections, let C be the symmetric N x N
matrix with zeros on the diagonal and entries c(i, 7) for i < j and c(j,i) for i > j.
When C is the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph G, the quantity [—T~],
where T~ is defined in Proposition 1.2, coincides with the arboricity of G. The
arboricity of an undirected graph G is defined as the minimal number of forests that
partition the edge set of G. By the main result in [23], the arboricity of a graph is
given by

[EI
\V|-1

where the maximum is taken over all subgraphs H of the graph G, and where E(H)
and V(H) denote the sets of edges and vertices of H, respectively. The quantity

apse
HCG |V(H)|-1

is often referred to as the fractional arboricity in the literature.

In the more general setting of matroids, determining the arboricity (7.1) of a
graph generalizes to finding the minimal number of independent subsets into which
a matroid can be partitioned. This is known as the matroid partitioning problem,
and a formula analogous to (7.1) was established in [35], and there is also a version
related to Section 7.1 in [30].

Finally, note that when C is an adjacency matrix, the quantity —@* coincides with
the log canonical threshold of a certain ideal associated to a reduced hyperplane ar-
rangement, as explained in Section 2. For a general reduced hyperplane arrangement,
the log canonical threshold was computed in [22]. The formula for the log canon-
ical threshold established in [22] appears to be related to the matroid partitioning
problem [30] in a similar way as described above in the case of graphs.

7.2. Random couplings and the Sherrington—Kirkpatrick model. Let us now go back
to the case of random couplings in Section 5. Curiously, this problem resembles
a problem coming from the statistical study of spin glasses, namely the so called
Sherrington—Kirkpatrick model. In this model, the space of states is given by a spin
vector oj € {-1,1}% and the Hamiltonian is given by

(7.2) H(a) =—So Iiyoiog +h 03.
aj a

where h is some fixed external field and Jj;, for 1 < 1,7 < N, are random interaction
terms, typically assumed to be i.i.d. Gaussian. The main problem in this setting is
CRITICAL TEMPERATURES AND COLLAPSING OF TWO-DIMENSIONAL LOG GASES 33

to understand the ground state energy,
(7.3) Amin = min — H(o),
o€{-1,1}%
for example in terms of its expectation over the random couplings. As is standard in
statistical mechanics, this can be reduced to computing the limit of the free energy

1
F(8) = 5Bllog Ziv(6)),
where Zy (3) is the partition function

Zy(8)= >> exp(-8H(o)),
oe{-1,1}4
as 3 — oo. A solution was found with heuristic methods by Parisi in [27], the famous
“Parisi solution”, which was later rigorously proven by Talagrand in [32].

To see a connection with the main problem of this paper, we will assume that the
spins take values in {0,1} instead. That is, put o = y in (7.2) and (7.3) where y is
a vector in {0,1} as in Section 4. Note that the main result of [32] includes this
case as well. Let C denote the symmetric N x N matrix with entries c(i, 7) for i < j,
c(j,7) for i > 7 and zeros on the diagonal. Given a solution to Proposition 1.2, that
is, a vector y’ € {0,1}% solving the optimization problem

(7.4) max ee a
xe{o,1N: XTX — 1
xT x22

then x’ is also a solution to the optimization problem

N

5 min —x? —T” ;)=—T,

(7.5) itty, ( x" Cx x)
x7 x22

where we note that ye xi = xT x. Conversely, a solution to (7.5) for which h =
—T-, or any solution for which Hyin = h, is a solution to (7.4) as well. A similar
statement is true also regarding Proposition 1.1 and T+. Thus, it seems that the
Parisi solution of the Sherrington—Kirkpatrick model with spins taking values in {0, 1}
might be useful to understand the critical temperature of the Log gas with random
couplings. Indeed, for fixed deterministic couplings and for a carefully chosen external
field h, the ground state energy of the Sherrington—Kirkpatrick model is precisely the
negative of the critical temperature of the corresponding Log gas. Although, knowing
the expectation of Hin does not directly yield any knowledge about the expectation
of T~. Moreover, whereas in the Sherrington—Kirkpatrick model, the coupling c(i, 7)
are assumed i.i.d. Gaussian, the assumption in [20] seems more natural, where the
charges k; are assumed i.i.d. Gaussian. This version of the Sherrington—Kirkpatrick
model does not seem to have been considered previously.
