On connection of NMR spectrum symmetry with spin system properties
D. A. Cheshkov, D.O. Sinitsyn

Moscow, 2025

Some NMR spectra exhibit symmetry, which can be reasonably categorized into two
types: (1) the symmetry of a first-order multiplet about its resonance frequency, and (2) the
symmetry of the entire spectrum of spin system about its spectral center of mass, as observed,
for example, in AB and AA'XX' spin systems. The first type of symmetry is readily explained
by the fact, that the coupled nuclei exist in different spin states, that contribute equally to the
spectral density on either side of the resonance frequency, regardless of the nuclei spin quantum
numbers.

The second type of symmetry is an intrinsic property of the entire spin system. For
instance, the spectra of AB (AX) and AA'BB' (AA'XX’) systems exhibit symmetry about their
mid-resonance frequency, (vatvs)/2. At first glance, one might expect the AA'A"XX'X" spin
system with Csy symmetry (as in 1,3,5-trifluorobenzene) to also be symmetric about (vittvr)/2;
however, this is not observed in practice (see Figure 1).

Apparently, the first condition for a spectrum to be symmetric about its mid-resonance
frequency is a symmetrical distribution of the spectral density around this frequency. This can
be thought of as an "equilibration" of the resonance frequencies of the spins. However, this
condition, although necessary, is not sufficient to guarantee overall spectral symmetry.

We found that spin systems with symmetrical spectra possess J-coupling matrices that
are symmetric about their secondary diagonal. However, this symmetry may not be
immediately apparent, as the appearance of the J-coupling matrix depends on the order of the
spins, which is generally arbitrary. Therefore, it may be necessary to find a specific ordering of
the spins that results in a J-coupling matrix with this secondary diagonal symmetry, provided
such an ordering exists. Spin reordering is effectively a permutation operation, which
corresponds to conjugating (in the group theory sense) the Hamiltonian (along with other spin
operators and the J-coupling matrix) by a permutation matrix, an operation under which the
spectrum remains invariant. Notably, a J-coupling matrix that is symmetric about its secondary
diagonal remains unchanged upon reversing the order of the spins.

Let us illustrate this using the o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) spin system (AA'XX’) as an
example. When the resonance frequencies are arranged in the order {O1, O%, Ms, M's}, the
resulting J-coupling matrix does not possess symmetry about the secondary diagonal (Figure
2, a). However, reordering the spins as {O1, Ms, M's, O'2} reveals the underlying secondary
diagonal symmetry (Figure 2, b).

This symmetry is preserved upon permuting only the ortho-protons to {O'2, Ms, M's, Oi}
or only the meta-protons to {O1, M's, Ms, O}. These permutations (Figure 2, ¢) result in
swapping the coupling constants Jo (Jax) and Ju (Jax’), while leaving the spectrum unchanged.
The invariance of the spectrum to this swap is a direct consequence of its dependence on the
magnitudes |Jo+Ju| and |Jo-Jml.

Furthermore, calculation of the spin energy levels, transition frequencies, and intensities
confirms that the spectrum is also determined by |Jpt+Jo| and |Jp-Jo|. Consequently,
interchanging the coupling constants Jp (Jaa’) and Jo: (Jxx') leaves the spectrum unaltered
(Figure 2, d and e). This interchange is equivalent to swapping the resonance frequencies
Vo (va) and vm (vx) (Figure 2, f and g).

Thus, six spin system matrices (Figure 2, b-g) and the two additional permuted matrices
(Figure 2, h and i) yield identical spectra. The J-coupling part of all these
matrices exhibits symmetry about the secondary diagonal.

Let us now consider the equilibration of resonance frequencies. In a spin order that yields
a J-coupling matrix symmetric about the secondary diagonal, the spins whose resonant
frequencies must be equilibrated are those that are interchanged when the spin order is reversed,
ie. the first with the last, the second with the penultimate, and so forth. The coupling constants
for these corresponding spin pairs are located on the secondary diagonal.

However, the sequence of resonance frequencies in ODCB, {vo, vm, vo, vo}, is different.
Yet, due to the additional spectral invariance under the permutation of vo and vm, spectral
equilibration about (vat+yvx)/2 is still observed.

For the case of chemically equivalent spins, two further equilibration schemes are
possible: {va, va, vx, vx} H {va, vx, va, vx}. Both yield spectra symmetric about (vat+vx)/2, but
they are not realized in practice, as they require the equality Jaa=Jxx.

For the 1,3,5-trifluorobenzene, AA'A"XX'X" spin system with C3y symmetry the
exhaustive enumeration of all possible J-coupling matrix representations was performed. This
yielded 120 unique matrices out of 720(6!) total permutations, with each unique matrix
occurring 6 times, corresponding to the 6 symmetry elements of the C3y point group.
Accounting for the symmetry between the H(A) and F(X) spin subsystems further reduces the
number of unique matrix types to 60, and none of the resulting matrices exhibited symmetry
about the secondary diagonal (Appendix, Table 1). The absence of this symmetry type is, again,
a consequence of the inequality Jaa: # Jxx:. Nevertheless, the high symmetry of the spin system
results in symmetric signal patterns for the 'H(A) signal about va and for the !°F(X) signal

about vx.
