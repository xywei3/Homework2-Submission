Abstract—A review of publications devoted to the study of the characteristics of the
Radcliffe wave has been given. The advent of mass measurements of radial velocities of
stars has recently led to a number of interesting results obtained from the analysis of spatial
velocities of stars and open star clusters. An important place in the study has been given
to issues related to the clarification of the direct or indirect influence of magnetic fields on
the process of formation of the Radcliffe wave. The hypothesis of Parker instability of the
galactic magnetic field as one of the reasons for the formation of wave-type inhomogeneities
in the galactic disk has been discussed.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Local System is known [1-3] as a complex structural formation near the Sun that fills
the space between two segments of the Carina-Sagittarius and Perseus spiral arms. From a
modern point of view, it includes clouds of neutral (for example, the Lindblad ring [4, 5]) and
molecular hydrogen, interstellar dust, protostars, as well as young stars of various spectral
classes. The stars are concentrated mainly in a few large OB associations [6] and open star
clusters, although there are also field stars [7]. The Gould Belt [7-11], with a radius of ~500
pe, is part of the Local System. A number of authors [10, 11] identify the Local System with
the Orion Arm. Thus, the size of the Local System is ~1 kpc in the diameter (along the
galactic axis ), and it is extended by 3-4 kpc in the perpendicular direction (approximately
along the axis y).
The publication of a catalogue of molecular clouds [12] with highly accurate estimates of
their distances (with an average error of ~5%) became an important milestone in the study
of the Local System. In particular, based on the analysis of this catalogue, the Radcliffe
wave was discovered [13], which is a narrow chain of clouds, stretched almost in a line with
a length ~2.7 kpc in the galactic plane zy. The main feature of this structure is the clearly
visible wave-like nature of the distribution of clouds in the vertical direction. In this case,
the maximal value of the coordinate of z ~ 160 pc is observed in close proximity to the Sun.
According to its discoverers [13], the wave is attenuating. These authors also concluded that
the narrow chain distribution of molecular clouds refutes Blaauw’s [14] hypothesis that the
Gould Belt could have formed as a result of a hypernova explosion.

In the hypernova explosion model, the shock wave in the galactic disk forms an expanding
ring-shaped structure, which, due to the galactic tide, is stretched over time along its galactic

'bob-v-vzz@rambler.ru
orbit and takes on an elliptical shape. This model explained well the existence of the Lindblad
ring. However, this model is no longer able to explain the significant tilt of the Gould Belt
to the galactic plane.

There is currently no clear understanding of the nature of the Radcliffe wave. According
to [15], the origin of the Radcliffe wave is associated with the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability,
which occurs in the disk of the Galaxy because of the difference in the rotation speeds of
the dark matter halo and the disk. A hypothesis is being discussed about the impact of an
external impactor on the galactic disk [16], which could be a dwarf galaxy—a satellite of the
Milky Way, a massive clot of dark matter, or a globular cluster.

According to a number of authors [17, 18], the Radcliffe wave could have arisen as a
result of the impact of shock waves from several supernovae and their stellar winds during
the formation of the Local Bubble or North Polar Spur. However, the most important
question about the role that the magnetic field plays in the formation of bubbles remains
open to this day [19].

Currently, more than a dozen publications have been devoted to the study of the Radcliffe
wave. The wave-like behavior of vertical coordinates has been confirmed in the distribution
of interstellar dust [20, 21], molecular clouds [22], masers and radio stars [23], T Tauri stars
[24], massive OB stars [16, 25], and young open star clusters [18, 25, 26].

This paper is aimed to review the most important aspects related to the study of the
Radcliffe wave. Since the publication of our review on this topic [27], a number of signifi-
cantly new results have emerged [17, 18, 21, 28-33]. The nature of the distribution of object
coordinates in the Radcliffe wave is relatively well known. The properties of their vertical
velocities have been studied significantly less, and data for analysis have only become avail-
able in very recent times. An important place in this paper is given to issues not previously
addressed, related to the clarification of the possible direct or indirect influence of magnetic
fields on the process of Radcliffe wave formation.

2 PROPERTIES OF THE RADCLIFFE WAVE

In this paper, we consider the heliocentric rectangular coordinate system xyz, in which the
x axis directed from the Sun to the center of the Galaxy, the direction of the y axis coincides
with the direction of rotation of the Galaxy, while the z axis is directed towards the north
galactic pole, as well as the galactocentric rectangular coordinate system XYZ, in which
the X axis directed from the center of the Galaxy to the Sun, the direction of the Y axis
coincides with the direction of rotation of the Galaxy, and the Z axis directed towards the
north galactic pole. Thus, in these two coordinate systems, only the directions of the X axes
and differ. In this case, the orientation of the Radcliffe wave with respect to the and axes
differs in the sign only. For example, in the heliocentric coordinate system, the transition to
the hatched axis by the angle of 30° is carried out as follows:

y = ycos 30° + xsin 30°. (1)

2.1 Molecular Clouds

The detection of the Radcliffe wave was made possible by the studies [12, 34], where distances
to 326 molecular clouds concentrated in approximately 60 regions of active star formation

were obtained were estimates. The clouds are located in the Orion Arm region at heliocentric
distances from 150 pc to 2.5 kpc with altitudes of |z| < 300 pc. These authors developed
a method [34] that combines high-precision photometric data with trigonometric parallaxes
of stars from the Gaia DR2 catalogue [35]. According to their estimates, the distances to
molecular clouds were determined with an average error of ~5%.

According to the data from the catalogue [12], in [13], a narrow chain of molecular clouds
that is stretched out almost in one line that is located at an angle of ~30° to the galactic y axis
, was identified. In vertical coordinates z, a wave of clouds was discovered. The first authors
of this scientific team are representatives of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, so they named the wave in honor of their home institute.
Actually, it is not entirely correct to call this formation a wave. In fact, the Radcliffe wave
is a periodicity with variable amplitude. Its main feature is the indication of the presence of
a strong disturbance of the vertical coordinates of molecular clouds.

The Radcliffe wave modeling in [13] was performed using a quadratic function in coor-
dinate space xyz, that is defined by three sets of “reference points” (0, yo, 20), (1, Y1, 21);
and (#2, y2, z2). The wave-like behavior about the wave center was described by a sinusoidal
function about the plane XY with a decaying period and amplitude. As a result, Alves et

al. [13] found the following parameters of the model wave:

A = 2.7+0.2 kpc,
A= 160+30 pe,
Oscatter = 60 + 15 pc,
Mass > 3 x 10°Mo,

(2)

where X is the wavelength, A is the wave amplitude, Oscatter is the standard deviation of the
vertical coordinates of clouds from the model, and the given errors of the parameters in (2)
correspond to the 95% level (+20).

In the study of Bobylev et al. [27], a Fourier analysis was applied to the same molecular
cloud data, from which the Radcliffe wave was discovered in [13]. For this purpose, 189
clouds located in a narrow zone inclined at an angle of 30° to the y axis were selected. The
distribution of these clouds in projection onto the galactic plane XY is given in Fig. 1.

For the case of a polychromatic wave (when all frequencies of the main lobe in the power
spectrum are used), it was found:

A = 2.5+0.1 kpe,
Zmaxe = 150 +4 pe, (3)
oa, = 46 pc,

where the \ value corresponds to the maximum of the power spectrum, Zax corresponds A
in (2), 7, corresponds Oscatter in (2), and the parameter errors correspond to the level of 68%
(t1c). The result (3) is reflected in Fig. 2, from which it is evident that the maximal value
of the wave Zmax is achieved at —0.4 y’ ~ —0.4 kpc. The main lobe frequencies of the power
spectrum used to construct the periodic curve are marked by vertical lines in Fig. 2b. Thus,
we have good agreement between the values of parameters (2) and (3) that are obtained by
different methods.

We note the study [28], which presents a new catalog of distances to molecular clouds
located within ~2.5 kpc from the Sun. Distances to 63 clouds were obtained using parallaxes
of ~3000 young stars from the Gaia DR3 catalogue [36]. According to [28], the typical
uncertainty in measuring the distance to clouds is approximately 3% (internal error). Good
agreement was found with a spread of ~10% between the new distances to the clouds and

previous estimates (for example, with the estimates from [12]). According to [28], unlike the
distances to clouds obtained by taking into account interstellar absorption, this catalog is a
more suitable reference material for studying the physical properties of nearby dense regions.
Although a significantly smaller number of clouds was used compared to [13], the presence
of disturbances in the vertical positions of clouds that is characteristic of the Radcliffe wave
was confirmed.

2.2 Interstellar Dust

The nature of the distribution of gas and dust clouds in the Local System is of great impor-
tance for the study of a number of astrophysical problems, in particular, for the analysis of
the spiral structure, as well as the study of the properties of the Radcliffe wave.

In [20], photometric data on stars from the Gaia EDR3 catalogue [37] were combined with
infrared photometric data on stars from the 2MASS catalogue [38]. Based on this material,
a three-dimensional map of interstellar absorption in the local volume was constructed. The
vertical sections show wave-like deviations from the galactic plane with an amplitude of up
to 300 pc in different directions. While in section number 3 that is oriented in the direction
of | = 60°, the manifestation of the Radcliffe wave is clearly visible.

Edenhofer et al. [21] presented a new high-resolution 3D dust distribution map that
extends to 1.25 kpc from the Sun. According to these authors, the reconstruction has a

high dynamic range and reveals weak dust lanes in the considered region. Small, roughly
spherical cavities are visible throughout the map. The dust clouds are compact and only
weakly elongated radially. According to these authors, the Radcliffe wave is resolved at an
unprecedented level of detail that is previously only available for the closest dust clouds.

The map from [21] is available online!. It is presented in Fig. 3, where the condensations
of young stellar objects (YSOs) are plotted. For this purpose, data from catalogues [39-41]
were used. As can be seen from the figure, the YSOs that we associate with the Radcliffe
wave are located along the red line. At this angle, we set the selection zone in [23] when
analyzing the YSO sample from the catalog [42].

2.3 Young Stars

Young stars are of great interest for studying the properties of the Radcliffe wave, since for
many of them, besides their exact positions, their spatial velocities are known. Here, we will
consider them in order of increasing age: stars that have not reached the main sequence stage
(YSOs, young stellar objects); masers and radio stars, among which are both protostars and
stars that have not reached the main sequence stage, as well as several massive stars no older
than OB2; and finally, OB stars.

2.3.1 YSO

Li and Chen [24] found a relationship between their vertical positions and vertical velocities
using data from YSOs tracing the Radcliffe wave. The vertical velocities of the stars were
calculated without using radial velocities, only from their proper motions. Despite this, these
authors obtained an important result. Namely, they found a phase difference of ~ 27/3
between waves in coordinates and velocities.

In the study of Bobylev et al. [23], a sample of YSOs from the catalogue [42] was studied.
Based on a Fourier analysis of 600 stars that have not reached the main sequence stage, an
estimate of the amplitude zmaz = 118 +3 pce (which is achieved when y’ = —0.4 kpc) and
wavelengths of A = 2.0 + 0.1 kpc was obtained, which is in good agreement with the values
of parameters (2) and (3). Unfortunately, for 90% of the selected stars, there were no radial
velocity data, only their trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions from the Gaia DR2
catalogue were available [35].

2.3.2 Masers and radio stars

In the study of Bobylev et al. [23], in addition to YSO, a sample of maser sources and
radio stars with trigonometric parallaxes measured by the VLBI method was also studied.
68 such objects were used with parallax errors less than 15%. Based on a Fourier analysis,
an estimate of the amplitude value was obtained zmax = 8744 pe (which is achieved when
y’ = —0.28 kpc) and wavelengths 4 = 2.8 + 0.1 kpc, which is in good agreement with
the values of parameters (2) and (3). In this case, for the first time, reliable estimates of
velocity disturbances W in the Radcliffe wave were obtained. The following values of the
maximal disturbance Winae (which is achieved when y’ = 1.4 kpc) and the wavelengths of
these disturbances velocity were found:

Wax = 5.1+0.7 km/s, (4)
A = 3.9+1.6 kpc.

2.3.3. OB stars

In the aspect of studying the properties of the Radcliffe wave, a sample of very young OB
stars was first analyzed in [25]. Besides, these authors analyzed 13 open star clusters (OSCs)
younger than 30 million years from the solar neighborhood with a radius of ~2 kpc and found
that, single OB stars compared to OSCs are worse at representing an elongated structure
that traces the Radcliffe wave, so the main emphasis was placed on the analysis of OSCs.
Although they showed that there is some relation between the perturbations of the vertical
positions and vertical velocities of the analyzed objects, their results are preliminary due to
the low power of the samples.

2.4 Open Star Clusters

For most open star clusters located within the Local System, their heliocentric distances,
proper motions, and radial velocities, the values of which are calculated as averages over
many members of the cluster, are known. Thus, the value of OSCs is that they allow for
a highly accurate analysis of both their positions and their spatial velocities. Precisely, for
the OSCs, new, interesting results describing the properties of the Radcliffe wave have now
been obtained.

In [43], a sample of 374 OSCs younger than 25 million years (with an average age of 9.7
million years) was analyzed. The data for these clusters were taken from the catalogue [44],
one of the most complete to date (it includes more than 7000 OSCs, and the average distances
and velocities for them were calculated using data from the Gaia DR3 catalogue [36]). Based
on the Fourier analysis, the following estimates were obtained: (a) the maximal value of the
vertical coordinate was Zmax = 92+10 pe and the wavelength was A = 4.82+0.09 kpc, and (b)
the maximal disturbance velocity was Winax = 4.36+0.12 km/s (achieved at y’ = —0.71 kpc),
and the wavelength of these disturbances was 1 = 1.78 + 0.02 kpc. These results are shown
in Fig. 4.

The authors of [18] analyzed the OSC parameters taken from the catalog [45] (containing
~1900 OSCs with astrometric data from the Gaia DR2 catalog [35]) and found that the
Radcliffe wave oscillates in the plane of the Galaxy and also drifts radially from the galactic
center. The dependences of vertical coordinates and vertical velocities on the coordinate y/’
that are obtained by them from a sample of young OSCs are shown in Fig. 5. Figure 5 was

constructed by us based on the interactive graphic data of these authors”. It is evident that
there is a phase difference between the waves in coordinates and velocities, noted earlier in
[24].

The diagram of the radial and tangential motion of the Radcliffe wave found in [18] is
given in Fig. 6. Besides, these authors concluded that the radial outward drift of the Radcliffe
wave from the Galactic center suggests that the cluster whose supernovae eventually created
today’s expanding Local Bubble may have been born in the Radcliffe wave. Treating the
Radcliffe wave as a single coherent structure in space and velocity that responds to the
galactic potential, they found that the structure is well modeled as a damped sine wave with
a maximal amplitude of ~220 pc and a mean wavelength of ~2 kpc. The corresponding
maximal vertical velocity is ~14 km/s.

By modeling the motion of individual clouds in the galactic potential, the authors of
[32] showed that the shear and epicyclic motion stretch the Radcliffe wave almost twice its
current length over time on the scale of ~45 million years. They also found that during this
time, new thread-like structures can form and existing ones can merge. The figures in their
paper clearly show that a thin chain of clouds in the present time (as the red line in Fig.
3) very quickly takes on a sawtooth appearance over time. These authors insist that it is
an oversimplification to regard the Radcliffe wave as a rigid body in the galactic disk as an
oscillating structure in the vertical direction.

In [31], high-resolution spectroscopy was performed on 53 stars, members of seven OSCs
(the age is <100 million years) that are located along the Radcliffe wave. Radial velocities
and atmospheric parameters were presented for all 53 stars. For a subsample of FGK stars,
abundances for 25 chemical elements were determined. On average, OSCs show chemical
compositions consistent with those of the Sun. Finally, a correlation between the chemical
composition, age, and position of the clusters along the Radcliffe wave that demonstrates
the physical connection of OSCs of different ages within the inhomogeneous mixing scenario
was obtained.

3 RADCLIFFE WAVE AND GOULD BELT

The geometric characteristics of the Gould belt, which were determined from the OSCs and
from young stars, are well known [14, 46, 47]. As can be seen from Fig. 3b, the center of the
Gould belt is located very close to the symmetry axis of the Radcliffe wave. According to, for
example, Fig. 5, it is located in the region where the amplitudes of disturbance of vertical
positions and vertical velocities reach the highest values. All this indicate the common
origin of the Radcliffe wave and the Gould belt, and their origin and further evolution are
inseparable.

4 RADCLIFFE WAVE AND AND ORION ARM

4.1 Orion Arm and Grand Design Structure

Already in Fig. la, the absence of any chain of clouds located at an angle of 10°-15° to the
axis , characteristic of the Orion arm is striking.

in the table are in the range from —10° to —13°. These values are very different from the
tilt of the chain of molecular clouds of —30°, by which the Radcliffe wave was discovered.
Nevertheless, we note a recent paper [59], where the spiral structure of the Galaxy was
studied based on a sample of approximately 500 H II zones, the distances to which were
determined using trigonometric parallaxes of OB2 stars from the Gaia DR3 catalogue. These
authors concluded that the segments of spiral arms outlined by young objects and evolving
stars are consistent with each other, at least in the solar neighborhood. In particular, the
Local Arm, outlined by young objects is interpreted by them as a segment of an arm with
a large twist angle of —25.2° + 2.0°, the inner edge of which is in good agreement with the
Radcliffe wave.

4.2 Large-Scale Waves in the Galactic Disk

The wealth of information provided by the new stellar data catalogues of the Gaia project
has led to the discovery of various types of flexural waves in the Galactic disk (e.g., [60, 61]).

In this regard, it is interesting to note the study [62], in which the vertical structure and
kinematics of the galactic disk were analyzed using two samples: young giants and classical
Cepheids. Based on these data, a three-dimensional shape of the large-scale disk warp was
constructed. They obtain the warp amplitude of ~0.45 kpc at R ~12 kpc and ~0.7 kpc at
R~14 kpc, which is in full agreement with the estimates of other authors. These authors
then discovered a vertical wave above the warp that propagates radially from the galactic
center. However, they concluded that for a number of reasons, the found wave was different
from the Radcliffe wave. The reasons are as follows: (1) the scale of the Radcliffe wave is
significantly smaller than that found, (2) the waves have significant differences in wavelength,
and (3) their orientation (and position in the galactic disk) are completely different.

5 OTHER LOCAL SYSTEM DETAILS

As is already clear from Fig. 3, the Local System (Orion Arm) is not limited to the Gould
Belt and the Radcliffe Wave. In particular, this figure clearly shows the fiber stretched out
in length of ~700 pe and located at an angle of ~ 45° to the axis to the right of the Sun,
which almost touches the red circle (the boundary of the Gould Belt). This gas and dust
structure is designated as “Split” in [63].
In [64], the kinematics of the G120 complex, which they identified using 870-jm maps of
the Plank satellite [65], was studied. In Fig. 3, this complex, with a length of ~500 pc must
be located to the left of the Sun, at the top of the Gould Belt boundary, almost parallel to
the X axis. Lee et al. [64] calculated the spatial velocities of these clouds by combining the
radial velocities of the gas obtained from *CO maps with proper motions of stars associated
with gas. Using this data, they modeled the movement of gas clouds in the galactic disk.
In [32, 64], the joint kinematic evolution of three structures: the G120 complex, the
Radcliffe wave, and the “Split” was traced based on the assumption that these three struc-
tures form an evolutionary sequence. The G120 complex is thought to be an early stage
of filament formation, the Radcliffe wave is a typical example of a galactic-scale filament,
while the Split is a galactic-scale filament at a later stage of evolution. This conclusion is
based on the results of the following evolutionary prediction: as the simulation progresses,
the G120 complex turns into a thread, while the Radcliffe wave and the “Split” are greatly

11
stretched. Thus, as the simulation showed, the modern G120 gas complex will turn into a
filament similar to the Radcliffe wave, while the Radcliffe wave will be stretched.

Mapping the Milky Way’s spiral arms vertically is a hallenging problem. The authors of
[66] analyzed a sample of young giant stars from the Gaia DR3 catalog in order to create
a three-dimensional map of metallicity excess. The constructed map shows traces of spiral
arms. The vertical heights of the arms vary across the galactic disk, reaching amplitudes of
up to 400 pc, and exhibit vertical asymmetry relative to the midplane. In particular, the
Perseus arm exhibits high vertical asymmetry consistent with the galactic warp. Moreover,
evidence of a metal-rich stellar structure that oscillates vertically almost in phase with the
Radcliffe wave has been found. This new structure is larger in size and extends beyond the
Radcliffe wave, reaching vertical amplitudes of ~270 pc and extending at least four kpc in
length. For at least half its length, this Radcliffe Extended Wave is the inner edge of the
Local Arm.

The solar system revolves around the Milky Way. In doing so, it encounters various
galactic environments, including dense regions of the interstellar medium. These collisions
can compress the heliosphere, exposing parts of the Solar System to the interstellar medium
and increasing the influx of interstellar dust into the Solar System and Earth’s atmosphere.
The discovery of new galactic structures such as the Radcliffe wave raises the question of
whether the Sun has collided with any of them. In [67], the potential passage of the Solar
System through the Radcliffe wave over the past 30 million years was studied. For this
purpose, a sample of 56 open clusters younger than 30 million years associated with the
Radcliffe wave was used. The trajectory of the Solar System has been shown to have crossed
the Radcliffe Wave in the Orion region 18.2-11.5 million years ago. Moreover, the closest
approach occurred 14.8-12.4 million years ago. This period coincides, on average, with the
climate transition on Earth, which makes it possible to consider a possible connection with
paleoclimatology and the potential impact of the crossing of the Radcliffe wave on the Earth’s
climate. As these authors note, such an intersection could lead to anomalies in the content
of radionuclides, which is an important research topic in the fields of geology and nuclear
astrophysics.

6 SEARCHING FOR ANALOGUES OF THE RAD-
CLIFFE WAVE

May et al. [68] particularly noted a narrow chain of masers with a length of 3-4 kpc extends
in the direction | ~ 40°, passing from a segment of the Carina-Sagittarius spiral arm to the
Scutum arm. These authors suggested that this structure may be analogous to the Radcliffe
wave.

In Bobylev’s study [69], this chain of masers was tested for the presence of periodic
perturbations of vertical coordinates and vertical velocities. For this purpose, 65 masers with
estimated trigonometric parallaxes of less than 15% were selected in a narrow zone with a
width of ~1 kpc. As a result, no significant periodic perturbations of vertical coordinates
and velocities were found in this structure characteristic of the Radcliffe wave. However, in
the course of the analysis, it was discovered that the chain of masers, which already extends
from the Sun (capturing the Gould Belt region) to the section of the Scutum arm, looks
like a section of a logarithmic spiral with a twist angle of —48°. It has been suggested that
such a large-scale density wave could have triggered the formation of the Gould Belt, as well

12
as excited the wave in vertical coordinates and velocities in the Radcliffe wave. It would
be interesting to test this hypothesis on more material. At present, high-precision parallax
measurements are lacking to verify it.

7 MAGNETIC FIELDS

The results of the reconstruction of the interstellar magnetic field obtained based on po-
larimetric observations of stars located in the vicinity of the Sun were recently presented in
[30]. Their analysis revealed a clear correspondence between the direction of the interstellar
magnetic field lines and the direction of the projection of the Radcliffe wave onto the plane of
the sky for stars located within 400 pc of the Sun. However, the opposite situation is found
for stars located at distances exceeding 1.2 kpc. The force lines of the interstellar magnetic
field at these distances are located predominantly in the plane of the galactic disk.

In the vicinity of the Sun with a radius of ~1 kpc, the lines of force of the interstellar

magnetic field exhibit a noticeable inclination to the plane of the galactic disk. The average
value of the slope is of ~ 18°. In the direction where the Radcliffe wave crosses the central
plane of the galactic disk, the magnitude of the tilt angle, however, increases to 30°. The
same angle of inclination to the plane of the galactic disk in this region is also found in
the disturbed part of the gas and dust structure that is stretched along the magnetic field
lines and constitutes the Radcliffe wave. Gas movement is also observed, apparently in the
direction of the magnetic field lines. The velocity of gas movement along the Radcliffe wave
increases as the wave approaches the plane of the galactic disk and in the region of their
intersection reaches its maximum, which is ~10 km/s.
The totality of the obtained data allowed the authors [30] to consider a hypothesis, in
which the formation of the Radcliffe wave occurred as a result of the instability of the
galactic magnetic field. One possible scenario is the so-called Parker instability (see [70]
and the references therein). The change in the configuration of the interstellar magnetic
field in this case occurs as a result of the emergence of magnetic field tubes in a direction
perpendicular to the plane of the galactic disk. In the context of this scenario, magnetic
field disturbances lead to a spatial redistribution of the predominantly gas-dust component,
which is in a state close to being frozen into the interstellar magnetic field. The emergence
of the magnetic field leads to the formation of an arched structure, the scale of which in the
direction perpendicular to the galactic plane is of the order of the thickness of the galactic
disk. The characteristic size of the arch in the direction along the magnetic field lines in this
case corresponds to the wavelength of the Parker instability, which in the considered case
turns out to be of the order of 1-2 kpc [71-73], which corresponds to the observed Radcliffe
wavelength. The characteristic time of development of the Parker instability and formation
of a wave-like structure for the physical conditions realized in the Local Group is on the
order of several tens of millions of years. Estimation of this parameter is complicated by the
pressure created by cosmic rays, which are one of the most significant destabilizing factors.
The latest research results obtained in this direction show that the Parker instability can
develop on a time scale of ~20 million years [74]. The relaxation of such a structure is caused
by the process of magnetic field diffusion, the characteristic time of which significantly (by
a couple of orders of magnitude) exceeds the time of instability development.

It should be noted that Parker instability is a mechanism capable of accelerating the
process of star formation. One of the advantages of the “magnetic” scenario is the possibility

13
of explaining the observed composition of the Radcliffe wave, which includes predominantly
a gas-dust component and young stellar objects. The gas and dust component frozen into
the galactic magnetic field turns out to be most susceptible to disturbance in the event o
the development of Parker instability. The emerging magnetic field arches pull gas and dust
along with them, lifting them above the plane of the galactic disk. The movements of the
gas component along the magnetic field lines that are, caused by gravitational forces lea
to compactions that facilitate star formation. The main components of the disturbance in
this scenario are the gas-dust environment and young stellar objects (stars of early spectra
classes, young stars, and protostellar objects), the age of which does not exceed the age o
the Radcliffe wave itself. The perturbation of the population of stars formed before the onse
of instability, on the contrary, turns out to be insignificant. As a result, stars formed before
the development of instability will be located and move predominantly in the plane of the
galactic disk. Young stellar objects formed after the development of instability in the gas
filling the magnetic field arches will be located above the plane of the galactic disk and move
under the action of gravity in the direction of the plane of symmetry of the disk. The age
and velocity of movement of these objects make it possible to estimate the upper limit on
the age of the Radcliffe wave itself and to limit the permissible time for the development of
instability.

Estimation of the magnitude of the interstellar magnetic field strength B in the Radcliffe
wave zone can be obtained, taking into account that the kinetic energy of the material moving
along the magnetic field lines, Ey, ~ (1/2)M,v2,,, cannot exceed the value of magnetic energy
in the Radcliffe wave, Em, ~ (B?/87)Viw. This leads to the following inequality: B > Bo,

where fi se
Bo x2 :
0 = 2G € 7) (a =) (am =) (5)

Here, V, is the volume of space, My is the total mass of the substance, and v,w is the velocity
of movement of matter in the region of the Radcliffe wave. The estimate of the interstellar
magnetic field strength that we obtained appears to be rather realistic and corresponds to
the values of this parameter previously obtained by other authors [70].

Finally, it should be noted that a possible cause (trigger) for the development of Parker
instability could be a local increase in the fraction of accelerated particles (cosmic rays) in a
region of space with a characteristic size of the order of several hundred pc. The most likely
source of accelerated particles in this case is a supernova explosion or series of supernova
explosions (see, for example, [75] and reference therein).

8 CONCLUSIONS

Publications devoted to the study of the characteristics of the Radcliffe wave have been
reviewed. The advent of mass measurements of radial velocities of stars has recently led to
a number of interesting results obtained from the analysis of the spatial velocities of young
stars and, in particular, young open star clusters. An important place in the study has been
given to issues related to the clarification of the direct or indirect influence of magnetic fields
on the process of Radcliffe wave formation.

What is new is the establishment by various authors of radial motion in the galactic
plane XY front of dust matter, molecular clouds and young stars. This Radcliffe wave
front is widely extended along the axis y’ by ~2.5 kpc and is very narrow in the direction

14
perpendicular to this axis with a magnitude of ~0.3 kpc. It appears that this motion is not
associated with either the galactic spiral density wave or other large-scale disturbances of
the galactic disk.

Besides, the presence of vertical velocity disturbances W in the Radcliffe wave has been
indisputably proven. The epicenter of disturbances in vertical coordinates and velocities is
located in a relatively small area of the Local System near the Sun, where the Gould Belt is
located.

Estimates of the values of the main parameters and manifestations of the Parker insta-
bility of the galactic magnetic field support the hypothesis relating the formation of the
Radcliffe wave with instabilities of the interstellar magnetic field in the galactic disk. A
possible trigger for such instability could be an increase in the concentration of accelerated
particles (cosmic rays) in a local region of the galactic disk with a magnetic field strength of
several 1G.
