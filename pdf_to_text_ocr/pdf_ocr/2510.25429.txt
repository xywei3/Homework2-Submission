Schrédinger-invariance in non-equilibrium
critical dynamics

Malte Henkel and Stoimen Stoimenov

Abstract The scaling functions of single-time and two-time correlators in sys-
tems undergoing non-equilibrium critical dynamics with dynamical exponent z = 2
are predicted from a new time-dependent non-equilibrium representation of the
Schrédinger algebra. These explicit predictions are tested and confirmed in the age-
ing of several exactly solvable models.

1 Introduction: dynamical Schrédinger-symmetry

Many-body systems with strongly interacting degrees of freedom may display col-
lective properties which need not be obvious from the consideration of a single
degree of freedom. While there only exist very few analytically solvable systems,
they are often studied through numerical simulations, which may require huge com-
putational resources. Here we wish to explore the application of dynamical sym-
metries, not least motivated by the long-standing dream “we are looking forward
to the day when Lie groups can be pushed to give ... the dynamics ... of a physical
process.” [24]. Here we present a class of models whose dynamics can be described
as following from the covariance of certain response functions under a new type
of non-equilibrium representation of the Schrédinger Lie algebra. In this paper, we
shall consider systems quenched onto their critical point T = T.; a companion paper

ordered phase with T < T. [57].

We shall begin with a short review of those field-theoretical ingredients we shall
need to formulate our Schrédinger-covariance predictions (12) below. We shall work
throughout in the continuum limit and consider a coarse-grained ‘order-parameter’
scaling operator $(t,r) depending on the time ft and the space coordinates r.!
Averages of observables </ = |] should be found from a functional integral

with the interaction V’{@] and the spatial laplacian A, (with usual re-scalings). The
system is assumed to be in contact with a white-noise thermal bath of temperature
T. The corresponding gaussian fluctuations can be integrated out which leads to the
introduction of the response scaling operator @ in (la). Excluding any other source
of noise implies that the system is brought onto a critical point, with temperature T.,
of the corresponding equilibrium system which is what we shall need later.

3. The Schrédinger algebra contains time-translations X_; = —0,. Out-of-equi-
librium, time-translation-invariance is no longer valid. We therefore use instead of
the equilibrium representation X° (5) a non-equilibrium representation [36, 38]

For example, the generalised time-translation generator becomes X_) = —0; + 2.
A non-equilibrium scaling operator @ is characterised by a pair (5,€), besides its
mass. The dilatation generator Xo keeps its form and only modifies its scaling di-
mension 6 ++ deg = 6 — €. In this new representation the scaling operators become
(t) =15 6(t) = e&"@(t). The equilibrium response functions (6,7) are mapped to
non-equilibrium ones via (spatial arguments are suppressed for clarity)

4. Furthermore, it can be shown that in the non-equilibrium representation, the
non-linearity in the effective equation of motion (2.4 Oo, — 7) 6 = g0° becomes ir-
relevant for large times provided 2€ > 1 [56, 38]. Since the models we shall consider
later all have linear equations of motion, this aspect is not going to be important for
us and will be presented in more detail in [57].

Now combine the informations (4,6,7,10). We define the exponents

whereas the single-time correlator takes the form [39]

where U is a Kummer/Tricomi confluent hypergeometric function [1]. There is the

out of equilibrium, merely from a dynamical symmetry. Information on a specific

2 Physical ageing: non-equilibrium critical dynamics

The theory of section | will be applied to ageing systems [58, 52, 33, 59, 16, 62].
In classical dynamics, physical ageing arises in a many-body system which is pre-
pared in an initially fully disordered state (hence (@(t,r)) = (@(0,r)) = 0) and is
then instantaneously quenched onto its equilibrium critical point T.. The critical
fluctuations in the system lead to the formation of correlated clusters [2] with a time-
dependent length scale ¢(r). If for late times ¢(r) ~ r!/2, this defines the dynamical
exponent Z. Here, we shall only consider systems where Z = 2 which implies that
any conservation laws on the order-parameter @ are excluded. The relaxation-time
towards equilibrium becomes formally infinite, and one speaks of non-equilibrium
critical dynamics [28]. For quenches to T < T. one obtains phase-ordering kinet-
ics treated in [57]. Physical observables include the two-time correlator C and the
two-time response R with respect to an external perturbing field h, defined as

C(t,ssr) = (9(t,r)0(s,0)) =s Fe (<5) (13a)
5 > ne r
R(t,s3r) = aoe = (0(6,17)0(5,0)) =s1 Fe (-.5) (13b)

and we reused the response scaling operator @ [43, 17]. We always assume spatial
translation- and rotation-invariance such that r++ r = |r|. The associated scaling
form are valid for t,s >> Tmicro and tf —s >> Tmicro and are illustrated in figures 1
and 2 (specifically, for the voter model, to be defined below).

In figure 1 a typical single-time correlator C(s;r) = C(s,s;r) is shown. First, fig-
ure la shows that ageing is a slow dynamics, as with increasing age s, the correlator
C(s;r) decays more slowly. Second, there is no time-translation-invariance since
for each s the is a distinct curve C(s;r). Third, there is dynamical scaling since the

same data, replotted over against r/,/s, collapse onto a single curve, see figure 1b.
Several examples of this scaling function are shown in figure 1c for various values
of the dimension d. The same observations are made in figure 2 for the two-time
auto-correlator C(t,s) := C(t,s;0). First, the dynamics is slow, since with increas-
ing waiting time s, the auto-correlator C(s + 7, s) decays more slowly, see figure 2a.
Second, there is no time-translation-invariance, since for each value of s, there is a
distinct curve. Third, there is dynamical scaling, proven by the data collapse when
the same data are replotted in figure 2b over against y = t/s. This demonstrates the
three defining properties of ageing [58, 33] for the correlators and can be done sim-
ilarly for the response as well. This is expressed formally in the scaling form (13).
The auto-correlator and -response scaling functions are asymptotically algebraic

fly) = Fo(yi0) ~ ye? , fay) = Fe(yi0) wy 78”? 5 y > I (13c)

which define the auto-correlation exponent Ac (see figure 2c) and the auto-response
exponent Ar [42]. For spatially short-ranged initial correlations, one expects A =
Ac = Ag. In non-equilibrium critical dynamics, the ageing exponents b = a = (d—
2+1)/z where 77 is an equilibrium critical exponent.

Figures 1c and 2c show that the form of these scaling functions is distinct for
d < d* and for d > d*. They are expected to be universal, that is independent of
‘specific’ details such as lattice structure or details of the interactions. Field-theory
methods such as the €-expansion permit to compute their forms [9, 59], but we shall
strive to find those by comparing with the results (12) of Schrédinger symmetry
reviewed in section 1.

3 Models

3.1 Voter model

The voter model is a paradigm for non-equilibrium ageing [18]. On a d-dimensional
hyper-cubic lattice A C Z4, it is defined in terms of spin variables 6, = +1 at-
tached to each site n € A. Each configuration {o} of spins occurs with probability
P({o},t) and its evolution is described by a master equation

AP({o}.) = ¥ [won soyP({0"}.1) — wpojtoyP({o}.)] 14)

{o"}

In the voter model, transitions between configurations occur via single spin flips at
site n and with the rates [47, 60, 46]

1 1
Wlo}-{o'} wa({o}) = 7 (: - 24% en) (15)

where m(n) are the nearest-neighbour sites with respect to the site n € A. For d =
1 this reduces to the Glauber-Ising chain [25] at T = 0 and only in this special
case do the rates wy obey the detailed balance condition Wot} +{0}Peq({O"}) =
Wi}-5{0/}Peq({O}) which guarantees the relaxation towards an equilibrium state
with a Boltzmann distribution P.q({o}). The rates (15) lead to linear and closed
equations of motion for correlators and responses. Hence the voter model is exactly
solvable in all dimensions d > 0 [23] and we find (after rescaling) [40]

All known results for d = 1,2,3, see [19, 45, 8, 23, 26, 48, 54, 11, 12, 13, 14, 37],
are contained herein as special cases. The analytic results (16) prove the scaling
expectations (13) of ageing and from (16b,16c) we have the analytic proof of all
observations made on the scaling functions in figures 1c and 2c. The upper critical
dimension is d* = 2.

Finally, the comparison of (16) with non-equilibrium Schrédinger-invariance
(12) gives a complete and consistent agreement between all three observables so
that we can identify the universal scaling dimensions (§,§ ,€2, 62) along with v =0
and the non-universal .#@ = 1. The results are listed in table 1, where we included
the Glauber-Ising chain [8], quenched to T = 0, as a separate entry as well.

3.2 Spherical model

The critical spherical model is a classic model of interacting spins which can also
be obtained as the N — limit of the O(N) Heisenberg model. Heuristically, it may
be introduced by relaxing the constraint 6, = +1 of the Ising model spin variables,
with the purpose of obtaining an exactly solvable model. Spherical spins are contin-
uous Sp € R for all n € A and obey the mean spherical constraint Dye, (S2) = |A],
where |A| is the number of sites of the lattice A C Z4. At equilibrium, the nearest-
a model has a phase:transition for d > 2, with the critical temperature
= Jo du (e~ 2uT9( (2u))4 > 0 where Jp is a modified Bessel function [1]. In the
continuum limit, the local magnetisation S(t,r) obeys the Langevin equation [27]

0,S(t,r) =A,S(t,r) —3(2)S(,r)4+-n(t.r) . (n(t.r)n(0,0)) = 2T.6(2)6(r) (17)

with the spatial laplacian A, and a centred gaussian noise 7(t,r). The Lagrange
multiplier 3(t) enforces the mean spherical constraint. To solve the model for any
d > 0, define

g(t) =exp (2 ['ers) = (e-#19(41))4 +ar [are ~1)(e*(42))* a8)

and this Volterra integral equation follows from the spherical constraint [27]. Solv-
ing this leads to the long-time behaviour, for t > 1

which now permits to work out the observables. The singular term in this is needed
in the calculation of correlators, while it plays no réle for the long-time behaviour
of response functions. One has, up to normalisation for the two-time response for

This model [22, 4] describes the growth of a surface whose height takes the réle of
the order-parameter @(t,r). It satisfies a noisy diffusion equation (0, — Ay) O(t,r) =
n(t,r) where the gaussian white noise has the second moment (n(t,r)n(¢’,7’)) =
26(t—1')6(r—r’).

Up to normalisation, for all d > 0 the exact results [53] for the two-time observ-
ables can be recast, after re-scaling, as follows

This agrees with the generic expectation (12) and the resulting scaling dimensions
are listed in table 1. Indeed, it is known since a long time that the EW model is
described by the equilibrium representation (5) of the Schrédinger algebra with e=
&€=&=0,v=O0and./ = 5 [53].

3.4 Arcetri model

Before we continue with the discussion of another model of surface growth, we need
more background [4, 29]. The surface will be described, in the continuum limit, by
a height profile A(t,r) and this is usually assumed to be given in terms of a Kardar-
Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation

Oh =Aph+ f (V,h)? +7 (22)

with a white noise 7 and the constant p. For fs = 0, one is back to the Ew-model
of subsection 3.3. On a lattice, one often uses a representation where the heights on
nearest neighbouring sites j, j’ obey a RSOS constraint hj — hy = 41, see figure 3
for a 1D illustration. Evolution of the surface is only possible via the specific step
indicated. In terms of the slopes, this means that only the totally asymmetric move
—+-—+ + — is admissible.

We use that all nearest-neighbour slopes are restricted to the values +1 by the
RSOS condition. We follow [34, 20] and relax this in a way quite analogous to the
spherical model. First, for the heights we assume a Langevin equation

Oh(t,r) = A,-A(t,r) + 3(t)A(t,r) + n(t,r) (23)

with the white noise 7 and the Lagrange multiplier 3(t). We assume an initially
uncorrelated surface

((h(0,r))) =Ho , ((h(O,r)h(0,r’)Y) — (h(0,r))) ((h(0, r'))) =H 6(r—r') (24)

It is useful to consider the slopes ug(t,r) = dah(t,r), their Langevin equation

This defines the Arcetri model [34, 20] which stands with respect to the KPZ equa-
tion in about the same kind of relationship as stands the spherical model with re-
spect to the Ising model.? When concentrating on the slope variables u(t,r), it can
be shown that the 1D Arcetri model is identical [34] to the p = 2 spherical spin glass
[15]. Furthermore, the d-dimensional Arcetri model gives the same correlators and
responses as the spherical model in d+ 2 dimensions [34]. The exact solution fol-
lows closely the one of the spherical model, but we give a few more steps since the
model is less well-known. In Fourier space (25a) turns into

where the Volterra integral equation follows from the constraint (25b), by working

with the modified Bessel functions Jp; [1]. The critical point is located at To! =

we find [34]

where the singular term is important for the calculation of correlators and the known
constant gq will drop out for almost all observables.

We can now list the non-equilibrium averages for the Arcetri model quenched
onto its critical point J. [34]. We merely use the slightly modified definitions, with
respect to the spin models discussed before, as they arise in terms of the height
variables in the Arcetri model. For the response of the height h(t,r) with respect to
an external source, we have, with F taken from (29)

This permits to read off the exponents which describe the non-equilibrium age-
ing in this model. Since these are well-known, our interest centres on the form of
the various scaling function and the comparison with the predictions (12) of non-
equilibrium Schrédinger-invariance. Indeed, there is an overall agreement so that
we can identify the various scaling dimensions which are listed in table 1. We also
notice that vy = 0 and the non-universal .#@ = 1. For d > 2, the Arcetri model is in
the same universality class as its mean-field approximation, the EW-model.

In the context of interface growth, we add a last comment. An important observ-
able is the interface width

w?(t) =C(t,t) =C(t:0) ~ 178

={de-1 5 ifd <2 (31)

0 ; ifd>2

where B is usually called the growth exponent [4, 29]. Therefore, we read off for the
ageing exponent b = —2B = F (there is no obvious expectation for the exponent
a). On the other hand, we can also work out the height profile direct by returning to
(23) with 3(t) already known. With the initial condition (24) of an initially flat and
uncorrelated interface, the straightforward integration leads to

((h(¢,r)))) = a wrt nw B (32)

where we implicitly assume to be in a co-moving frame with the mean velocity
of the interface. In the KPZ equation, this relation between growth of the interface
width (31) and the anomalous height growth (32) is called the KPZ ansatz [4]. It is
thought to be brought about by the fluctuations in the KPZ equation. It is satisfy-

* Herewith we correct an important copying error in [34, eq. (A.7)].
Non-equilibrium critical dynamics 13

ing that the KPZ ansatz is satisfied in the Arcetri model for d < 2 as well, where
fluctuations lead to non-trivial values of the non-equilibrium exponents.

Particle-reaction models are widely studied in various branches of non-equilibrium
systems. Here we concentrate on the bosonic variant where on any site of the lattice,
particles can arbitrarily accumulate. One admits a single type A of particles. Single
particles can move diffusively, with rate D, to a nearest-neighbour site, irrespectively
of its occupation. In addition, particles are allowed to undergo the reactions [41, 49]

A-— 2A with rate Wy , AO with rate po (33)

and is called the bosonic contact process with diffusion (BCPD). Clearly, for U2 > Lo,
the whole lattice with be filled while for [42 < [po the particles will die out. There is
a critical line U2 = Lp. The model leads to diffusion equations to average particle
numbers and correlators. While the mean particle number (fdra(t,r)) = po stays
constant on the critical line, one studies the connected correlator

C(t, s;r) = (a(tro)a(s,r+ro)) — pe (34)

The main issue is the comparison with non-equilibrium field-theory, since the action

decomposes ¥ [9,4] = fol$,4]+ nl. 6], where
Sold.) = [a [aroma — Ar) (35a)
Fvl0,6] = te [ar [aro2(6-+p) (35b)

These forms follow from probability conservation. The deterministic action Yo is
the standard one, while the form of _Y, is distinct from the ones considered so
far. This will not modify the calculation of a response function (90). Because of
the Bargman superselection rule, correlation functions must be found by expand-
ing perturbatively the noisy part _Y,. This will give non-vanishing contribution of
a correlator (@@) either from two applications of the first term in (35b) or else a
single application from the second term in (35b). It can be shown that the first con-
tribution is less relevant than the second one [7]. Then one may define an effective
temperature Tz; = 2 Pp so that the leading terms are described by the same theory as
exposed in section 1. Then the scaling contributions are exactly those in (21) [49, 6],
up to normalisations and we know already that they agree with the predictions (12),
with v = 0. The universal behaviour of the BCPD is in the same universality class
as the EW-model, see table 1, which now includes the exact form of the scaling
functions. However, corrections to scaling should be distinct in both models.

3.6 Bosonic pair-contact process

As our last example, we study the bosonic pair-contact process with diffusion
BPCPD. The model is defined in complete analogy with the previous example, but
for a change in the reactions [49]

2A — 3A with rate 3 , 2A > @ with rate Lo (36)

Now the critical line is given by 2p = U3. Although the phases out-of-criticality
are physically trivial (for 29 > U3 the particles die out and for 29 < p3 the whole
lattice will be filled), the equations of motion only close, and hence be solved, at
criticality and we shall restrict to this case from now on. As in the BCPD, the mean
particle number (fdr a(t,r)) = po stays constant along the critical line. The be-
haviour along this line is determined by the parameter

3L3 1 du d
a= x= du (e“Io(4u)) G7)

and where the critical value a is finite for d > 2. For &@ > dc the particles cluster on
a single site [33, Fig. 3.22] and the variance grows exponentially in time. For @ <
Qc, the spatial particle-distribution remains homogeneous. For @ < a, the model
is in the BCPD-universality class. We discuss here the multi-critical point at @ = Qc.
As in the BPCD, we consider the connected correlator (34). Mathematically, the key
to the exact solution is the fact that the unconnected single-time correlator satisfies a
self-consistency condition which is very close to the spherical constraints discussed
above [49]. The single-time correlator was derived in [49], two-time correlators
(and responses) in [6] whereas their interpretation in terms of local-scale-invariance
was given in [7]. As an example, we calculate the single-time correlator for d > 4.
Starting from [49, (A.16)], up to multiplicative constants and in the continuum limit

=1 e U 0. sn) (38)
after exchanging the order of the integrations and with the identity [1, (13.2.6)].

The interpretation, again via Janssen-de Dominicis non-equilibrium field theory,
decomposes the action 4 [9,6] = Yo[¢,¢] + Ao[¢.¢] into a deterministic part
identical to (35a) and a noise part which contains five distinct contributions. It has
been shown that the most relevant one has the form given in (35b), where the rate
now reads U3 [7]. Hence, we can re-apply the reasoning used for the BPCD and
can re-use the predictions (12) for the single-time and two-time observables. The
exactly derived results in the BPCPD at the multi-critical point @ = a [49, 6] fully
agree with this expectation, with v = 0. We include in table 1 the respective values
for the non-equilibrium exponents, where the cases 2 < d < 4 and d > 4 need to be
distinguished.

Table 1 Values of the scaling dimensions needed in the calculation of correlators and responses in
exactly solved models of non-equilibrium critical dynamics with z = 2. EW denotes the Edwards-
Wilkinson model [22], BCPD and BPCPD are the diffusive contact and pair contact processes [49],
considered on their critical line.

Remarkably, the chemical-reaction systems of the BPCD and BPCPD, which do
not satisfy detailed balance, reduce to the same kind of analysis as the spherical and
voter models originally inspired from magnetism.

4 Conclusions

The new non-equilibrium and time-dependent representation of the Schrédinger al-
gebra [36, 38] has been used to predict the exact form of single-time and two-time
correlators (we include more early results on the two-time responses) for systems
undergoing non-equilibrium dynamics after a quench onto criticality, from a fully
disordered initial state. These predictions (12) for the entire scaling functions only
depend on a small number of non- n-equilibrium exponents, notably & and E. These
characterise the composite field @, which describes the coupling of the system to
its environment. Their values in various models are collected in table 1. In all cases,
we have found v = 0. Comparison of the results of the voter, spherical and Arcetri
models shows that the EW universality class acts as the mean-field theory for all
of them, although that mean-field regime is reached for different values of the di-
mension d in the various models. The multi-critical BPCPD at & = Qc has its own,
distinct, mean-field theory. The non-trivial nature of these models for d < d* is not
always apparent in the values of exponents such as A or Z = 2, but rather in the form
of the (connected) correlator scaling functions. The existing large variety of models
suggests that further exactly solved systems [61] within this framework might exist.
Possible extensions to quantum (hydro-)dynamics [63] would be of great interest.
