ABSTRACT

The radiation-dominated polar emitting region of an accreting X-ray pulsar is
simulated numerically in the framework of a three-dimensional (geometrically two-
dimensional) model. The radiative transfer within the emitting region and the struc-

ture of the latter are calculated with the use of the self-consistent algorithm developed
earlier. The magnetic scattering cross sections dependent on the photon energy and
polarization have been incorporated. Second-order bulk Comptonization over entire
emitting region, induced Compton scattering, the switching of the polarization modes,
free-free processes, the cyclotron emission because of electron-proton collisions, and
a realistic shape of the accretion channel have been taken into account. The case o
a dipole magnetic field is considered. It is shown that the induced Compton effect
can play a notable role in establishing the electron temperature in the post-shock
zone. Within the model shock wave, a higher electron temperature is achieved than
in the post-shock zone by means of the bulk-heating mechanism. The photons, gained
the energy in the shock wave and above it due to bulk motion effects and the thermal
Doppler effect, are responsible for the formation of high-energy regions in the emergent

continuum of the polarization modes.

1 INTRODUCTION

An accreting X-ray pulsar (Giacconi et al. 1971) is a magne-
tized neutron star in a binary system on to which a plasma
inflows from a companion star (e.g. Pringle & Rees 1972;
Davidson & Ostriker 1973; Baan & Treves 1973). The ac-
creting material is directed towards the neutron star along
the magnetic field lines, increasing the kinetic energy, the
main fraction of which is eventually released as the energy
of X-ray photons emerging from heated to corresponding
temperatures regions of the atmosphere of the neutron star
or those grown above the star. Usually, the areas of the emit-
ting regions across the magnetic field are much smaller than
the area of the neutron star surface, and the magnetic and
rotational axes of the neutron star are far enough apart to
coincide. Hence, the rotation of the neutron star provides the
possibility of the formation of the pulses of the X-ray radi-
ation that comes from those regions to a distant observer.

When the mass accretion rate is sufficient, above the
neutron star surface, inside the accretion channel, the region
containing the slowed plasma flow appears having, on aver-
age, a notably larger transverse Thomson optical depth than
the freely falling flow. Such structures are often referred to
as the accretion columns. Under certain circumstances, the
radiation pressure in the structure is much greater than the
gas pressure. Photons diffused from the almost stagnate in-
teriors are then advected by the compressed heated flow to
the neutron star surface (diffusing at the same time across
the magnetic field), to a region near the side boundary of
the channel, so that such a structure turns out to be sur-
rounded by a radiation-dominated shock wave (Davidson &
Ostriker 1973; Davidson 1973; de Hoffmann & Teller 1950;
Marshak 1958).

It is well known that modelling the deceleration of the
accretion flow in a radiation-dominated shock wave is an
example of a problem, which have not yet been consid-
ered exhaustively in the framework of a unitary study. The
2D numerical solution of Davidson (1973) became the first
2 M. Gornostaev

quantitative theoretical result showed the structure of the
emitting region formed in sufficiently luminous accretion-
powered X-ray pulsars. A one-dimentional approximation of
the initially 2D equations from this work was considered
by Basko & Sunyaev (1976). Blandford & Payne (1981a)
derived in the Fokker-Planck approximation the radiative
transfer equation (Chandrasekhar 1960; Mihalas 1978) for
the compressed flow of a plasma. This result is used in most
of the papers on the spectral radiative transfer in the accre-
tion columns listed in the next two paragraphs. In the papers
by Blandford & Payne (1981b) and Lyubarskii & Syunyaev
(1982), the solutions for the spectrum of radiation of a 1D
radiation-dominated shock were studied.

Wang & Frank (1981) obtained a number of 2D nu-
merical solutions for the steady-state structure of the col-
umn. Kirk (1985) developed a 2D analytical solution for the
structure of the radiation-dominated column at luminosities
at which the optically thick zone of the column has a rel-
atively small height. Arons, Klein & Lea (1987) described
the processes taking place in a strongly magnetized plasma
under the conditions of accretion columns. The first compu-
tational steps to solve the problem in a self-consistent way
were carried out in the following three works. Riffert (1988)
considered in the grey approximation a self-consistent 1D
problem of the dynamics, electron temperature and radiative
transfer inside the column. Rebetzky et al. (1988) modelled
the 2D column structure and solved the 3D (geometrically
2D) radiative transfer equation for the mode-summed spec-
tral intensity in an uncoupled manner, and the frequency-
dependent diffusion coefficients were used. Rebetzky et al.
(1989) obtained a 3D self-consistent solution describing the
2D structure of the column and the total emergent spectrum,
and the frequency-integrated energy equation was included
in the computational procedure. Thermal Comptonization
was neglected and bulk motion effects of second order in the
velocity were not taken into account. Only cases of relatively
low accretion rates were considered, at which the radiation
pressure effects become dynamically significant, so that typ-
ical obtained absolute values of the divergence of the bulk
velocity turned out to be relatively small. The angular dis-
tributions of the intensity of radiation emergent from the
sidewall of the accretion channel were obtained with the use
of the method of last scattering by Kraus et al. (1989). Maile
et al. (1989) studied the effects of the bulk motion on the ra-
diation patterns from the side boundary of the flow formed
at different frequencies solving a simplified coherent radia-
tion transfer equation under the conditions of the moving
material.

Burnard, Arons & Klein (1991) calculated the spectra
of the normal polarization modes from a preset radiation-
dominated mound with taking into account the angular pho-
ton redistribution using the Feautrier method (Burnard,
Klein & Arons 1988, 1990), and the processes in the shock
wave and above were neglected. The inclusion of the pho-
ton bubble oscillations in the numerical calculations of the
radiation-dominated accretion column was performed by
Klein & Arons (1989) (see also Arons 1992; Klein et al.
1996; Hsu, Arons & Klein 1997). A steady-state 1D dynami-
cal model of the cylindrical column was developed by Becker
(1998). Analytical solutions for the radiative transfer equa-
tion represented in the Fokker-Planck approximation for
such a column were obtained by Becker & Wolff (2005, 2007)

with making use of the velocity profiles allowing the separa-
tion of variables, but different from linear ones. Numerical
solution of the spatially 1D radiative transfer equation with
the use of the fenomenological power-law velocity profiles
was carried out by Farinelli et al. (2012, 2016). Mushtukov
et al. (2015a) obtained an expression for the critical luminos-
ity and some solutions describing the structure of the col-
umn. West, Wolfram & Becker (2017a,b) self-consistently
simulated the column taking into consideration the equa-
tions of state for the two-component plasma. The structure
of the flow was supposed to be one-dimensional. Gornostaev
(2021) (hereafter referred to as G2021) solved numerically
the problems of the 3D dynamical structure of the inclined
accretion columns, and the geometrically 2D problem of the
structure of the column and its emergent spectrum in a self-
consistent way, regardless of the straightforward observa-
tional applications (the gas pressure was neglected). The
MHD simulations of the 2D structure of the column were
performed by Zhang, Blaes & Jiang (2021, 2022), and de-
velopment of the photon bubble instability was confirmed.
Becker & Wolff (2022) took into account the upward widen-
ing of the accretion channel, analysed different velocity pro-
files (including those for the gas-dominated column), and
added to their previous considerations some calculations of
the cross sections in a strong magnetic field.

The structure of the accretion column should be inter-
preted as primarily dynamical one in the description above.
There are not many attempts not based on thermalization-
related predictions using the Stefan-Boltzmann law to cal-
culate the thermal properties of the column. Although es-
tablishing the temperature of electrons inside the radiation-
dominated plasma in accordance with the local Compton
equilibrium was mentioned repeatedly (e.g. Blandford &
Payne 1981a; Lyubarskii & Syunyaev 1982; Becker & Wolff
2007; Zel’dovich & Levich 1970; Illarionov & Syunyaev
1975b), the use of the specified approximation in calcula-
tions of the structure of the accretion column is quite rare
(Riffert 1988; West ct al. 2017a,b; G2021). Often the tem-
perature was set constant and parametrized (e.g. Becker &
Wolff 2007, 2022).

It seems that a physically consistent modelling of the
radiative transfer and accretion column structure taken into
consideration the entire diversity of non-stationary pro-
cesses, inhomogeneities in the gas flow, the influence of the
gas component, and included the calculation of cyclotron
processes and polarization of the radiation is a multidimen-
sional problem which still does not have complete solution
(Arons et al. 1987). Many years have passed since the esti-
mates of Davidson & Ostriker (1973) appeared to be useful
for thorough progress in understanding the nature of the
observed phenomena. There are the observational features
of the accretion-powered X-ray pulsars that need to be ex-
plained in the framework of theoretical models embracing
as much properties of the real objects as possible. The for-
mation of the spectrum within the polar emitting regions is
related with two interesting manifestations (among others):
variations in the continuum and in the parameters of the cy-
clotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF) (Truemper et al.
1978). It is remarkable that the experimental evidences ob-
tained suggest the existence of the relationship between the
changes in the continuum and CRSF (Klochkov et al. 2011).

This is often associated the positive correlation of the

CRSF energy with the X-ray luminosity Lx and the decrease
(increase) in the height of the emitting region (being in the
inhomogeneous magnetic field of an X-ray pulsar) with the
increase (decrease) in Lx (Staubert et al. 2007; Rothschild
et al. 2017; Lyutikov & Gavriil 2006). Such a property of the
emitting region is often explained (Rothschild et al. 2017;
Vybornov et al. 2017; Staubert et al. 2019) by the forma-
tion of the gas-dominated accretion column bounded from
above by a collisionless shock wave (Bisnovatyi-Kogan &
Fridman 1970; Shapiro & Salpeter 1975; Langer & Rappa-
port 1982; de Hoffmann & Teller 1950). Mushtukov et al.
(2015b) proposed the mechanism for the positive correla-
tion related to the Doppler shift of the CRSF during tran-
sitions between regimes of a relatively rapid flow and the
radiation-dominated accretion column. The negative corre-
lation of the CRSF energy with Lx (Makishima et al. 1990;
Tsygankov et al. 2006; Doroshenko et al. 2017; Vybornov
et al. 2018) is usually related with the emitting region be-
ing in the radiation-dominated regime. However, there is no
complete explanation for the phenomenon, and the number
of the observed sources demonstrating such a dependence
is very small. Possible known interpretations include: vari-
ations in the characteristic magnetic field strength due to
an increase (decrease) in the height of the emitting region
with increasing (decreasing) Lx; variations in the magnetic
field strength within the accretion funnel due to the MHD
instabilities (Mukherjee, Bhattacharya & Mignone 2013a);
a significant influence on the CRSF position of the intra-
atmospheric magnetic field of the neutron star during re-
flecting the direct radiation from the accretion funnel con-
taining a column of variable height (Poutanen et al. 2013).

The variety of the accumulated observational data on
the X-ray continuum of pulsars in a high-luminosity state
has also not yet found a complete interpretation. A part of
the observations contain the spectra with a fallen power-
law tail extending from relatively low energies < 10 keV
(Burnard et al. 1991; Becker & Wolff 2007; West et al. 2017b;
Becker & Wolff 2022). For some observations, the spectra are
characteristic having a high-energy thermal hump, which is
sometimes added by a pronounced fallen quasi-power-law
tail (Doroshenko et al. 2017; Kong et al. 2022; Shui et al.
2024).

In this work I model the shape of the continuum from
the radiation-dominated accretion column of an X-ray pul-
sar. It is well known that a strongly magnetized plasma is a
birefringent medium where the polarized radiation exists in
the form of two normal modes (Adler et al. 1970; Canuto,
Lodenquai & Ruderman 1971; Ginzburg 1970). The elec-
tric vector of one of them, called the extraordinary mode,
oscillates mainly perpendicularly to the plane originated by
the wavevector and magnetic field direction, and the electric
vector of another mode, called the ordinary mode, oscillates
mainly in the specified plane. Here, the limit of large Fara-
day depolarization is considered, which is the case when the
modes are orthogonal to high accuracy (Gnedin & Pavlov
1974; Mészdéros 1992). The length-scales and magnetic field
values (much less than 10'* G) within the problem allow us-
ing this approximation without concern for the off-diagonal
components of the intensity matrix.

The new solutions are numerically obtained within
a self-consistent model of an axisymmetrical radiation-
dominated accretion column developed in the 3D space

MNRAS 000, 1-19 ()

(originated by two spatial variables and the photon energy).
The calculated dynamical and thermal structures of the
column are polarization- and spectrum-dependent. The ra-
diative transfer equations are written in the Fokker-Planck
approximation for the extraordinary and ordinary normal
modes with the use of frequency-dependent magnetic scat-
tering cross sections. The results include the 2D distribu-
tions of the bulk velocity, the electron number density, the
total radiation energy density, the electron temperature cal-
culated in the local Compton equilibrium approximation,
and related to those distributions of the photon occupation
number for both polarization modes. The spectral luminos-
ity of the emergent radiation and, consequently, the polar-
ization fraction are calculated from specified distributions of
the occupation numbers.

The basic equations, parameters of the problem and
numerical method are described in Section 2. The results are
presented in Section 3. The discussion is given in Section 4,
and conclusions are contained in Section 5.

2 MODEL SETUP

It will be useful in what follows to consider the flow of plasma
accreting on to one of the magnetic poles of a neutron star.
Let M be the mass accretion rate per magnetic pole char-
acterising this flow. It is supposed that the plasma is purely
hydrogen and fully ionized. Since the source of the energy
of X-rays from the polar emitting region is the gravitational
energy of the accreting matter, a luminosity of the region
cannot exceed at a given M the value of
~ NN a)
where M and R are the mass and radius of the neu-
tron star, correspondingly, and G is the gravitational con-
stant. A radiation-dominated mound-like structure forms
in the accretion funnel when L exceeds the critical value
Ler ~ 10°°-10*" erg s~+ (Basko & Sunyaev 1976; Wang &
Frank 1981; Becker & Wolff 2007; Mushtukov et al. 2015a).
I will consider in detail the mechanisms responsible for the
conversation of the kinetic energy of the flow, and conse-
quently for the formation of the structure of the column
and the X-ray continuum from the boundary of the funnel.

2.1 Basic equations

Since the shape of the accretion channel is determined by
the geometry of the magnetic field, it is useful to introduce
spherical polar coordinates (r, 0, ¢) appropriate to the spe-
cial situation under consideration (Wang & Frank 1981).
The frame is inertial and related with the neutron star, and
r is counted from the centre of the star. At the star surface
r= R. Above the surface r is counted along the magnetic
field lines. At the upper boundary of the considered region of
the funnel r = ryp. The symmetry about the magnetic axis
corresponding to @ = 0 is supposed (all quantities are inde-
pendent of ¢). Within the funnel, the magnetic field strength
Bw Bustz', where By; is the strength at the neutron star
surface, r. = 7/R, and | is determined by the shape of the
magnetic field lines. Let 00 be the angle defined by the side
boundary of the filled funnel, and 6; and 62 be the angles

defined by the inner and outer side boundaries of the hollow
channel, correspondingly.

The steady state of the accretion column is of interest.
The momentum equation reads (Davidson 1973)

~, (2)
where v is the bulk velocity, u is the total mean (angle-
averaged) radiation energy density, ne is the electron number
density, and my is the proton mass. Equation (2) is written
under the assumption that dynamics of the flow is fully de-
termined by the radiation, so that the right-hand side is the
radiation pressure gradient accurate to the sign. The gravi-
tational acceleration, the gas pressure, and the viscosity are
neglected. The mean total radiation energy density is

ergy density, with n =n, + nz is the mode-summed mean
photon occupation number, and n; and nz are the mean pho-
ton occupation numbers for the extraordinary (subscript ‘1’)
and ordinary (subscript ‘2’) modes (other quantities depen-
dent on the polarization will be denoted in the same way),
€ is the photon energy, c is the speed of light, and h is the
Planck constant. Since the assumption on the frozen plasma
is used, the bulk velocity has the only non-zero component
vu, = —v, where v is the absolute velocity value.

The continuity of the mass flow implies that (Wang &

everywhere below the values 1 and 2.) Apart from the men-
tioned processes of two latter lines of (5), these equations
thus describe the spatial diffusion, advection, first-order bulk
Comptonization (which attended by the compression of the

plasma flow), thermal Comptonization, and second-order
bulk Comptonization. The latter is described by adding the
Mev" /3 quantity to the electron temperature within the
Doppler term in the Kompaneets operator (Psaltis & Lamb
1997; Titarchuk, Mastichiadis & Kylafis 1997; Farinelli et al.
2012, 2016). (As is known, bulk Comptonization of both
kinds is associated with the Fermi processes of the non-
thermal nature, ‘accelerating’ photons.)

Ignoring the specific behaviour of the magnetic electron
scattering cross sections near the cyclotron resonance, let us

For the photon energies above the cyclotron energy, it is set
that oy,; = 01,1 = 0: = or, and o3~i+: = or /4. The use of
a factor of one third in the spatial diffusion coefficients is a
certain arbitrariness, which cannot lead to any errors in the
solutions within the problem under consideration, except for
an insignificant variation in the width of the shock wave not
affecting the spectrum of the funnel.

The rate of free-free interactions for the ordinary mode

is the Gaunt factor written with the use of the Born approx-
imation for an arbitrary z. It is set that K, = 0, since the
coefficients of the free-free absorption and emission for the
extraordinary mode in the continuum are several orders of
magnitude smaller compared to those for the ordinary mode
at the energies of interest (e.g. Nagel 1981; Suleimanov et al.
2022).

Simple estimates for a non-magnetized static medium
show that the Compton scattering is a much more efficient
mechanism of the energy exchange than free-free processes
in the problem under consideration. Indeed, the rate of the
Compton interactions is (Illarionov & Syunyaev 1975a)

ometries a significantly exceeds K throughout the column.
Consequently, the heating and cooling due to Compton scat-
terings are the main processes governing the electron tem-
perature within the settling mound (post-shock zone in the
velocity distribution) and the dense region of the shock wave.
The source of cyclotron photons is given (cgs) by the

where the constant T, is the electron temperature set in
the region in which the temperature value cannot be fully
governed by the radiation. This is the case of the pre-shock
region and the upper low-density region of the shock wave,
where too low values of the photon number density and too
high values of the bulk velocity make the local Compton
equilibrium approximation inapplicable. Since an exact cal-
culation of the electron temperature in this region is not
the goal of this work and cannot change the main results,
(21) is used in the simulations. The influence of plasma com-
pression on the temperature manifests mostly through the
values of the photon occupation numbers, and the effects,
which would come through the modification of the expres-
sion for the temperature, are negligible. Expressions (19)
and (20) also do not include the terms responding to free-
free processes. After equating the heating and cooling rates,
it can be shown that the inclusion of these terms in (19) and
(20) could affect the values of To, np and Tc at plasma den-
sities considerably exceeding those at which the gas pressure
becomes important.

equations, it should be noted that the top boundary is dif-
ferent from the side ones, since there is no any real physical
boundary of the medium at the top (the structure of the
flow up to the magnetospheric boundary is not discussed
here). Relatively low-intensity spectrum taking place not so
far from that boundary cannot be simply an additive con-
tribution to the outgoing radiation. A lot of the photons
forming that spectrum — sooner or later — get knocked down
and thus became a contribution to the sidewall emission,
which is determined by solving the spatially 2D radiative
transfer under the conditions of the funnel. The radiation
flux along the magnetic field vanishes at large r. The spec-
trum of radiation emerging from the channel above the set
upper boundary can be found by modelling the radiative
transfer in the corresponding spatial regions.

The substantially non-stationary situation near the col-
umn base cannot be simulated in detail while one is con-
strained by the considered system of equations, therefore
the values of the electron number density obtained for the
corresponding region may differ from real those.

2.2 Problem parameters

The value of Mir = M/10!7 g s-' is varied in the
range 0.2-5. It is always set that ecye(R) = 50 keV.

The radius of the funnel base depends on the accretion
rate. The angular half-width of the funnel base 69(Mi7 = 1)
is taken as a parameter of the problem for a filled funnel,
while 61(Miz = 1) and 62(Mi7 = 1) are parametrized for a
hollow funnel. It is supposed that 62 = 1.10; and 0; = 4,
with 00 = 00(Miz = 1)Mi/" (Lamb, Pethick & Pines 1973;
Shapiro & Teukolsky 1983). The angular width of the fun-
nel base is not strictly related to the value of the surface
magnetic field. It is set that 00(Mir = 1) = 0.08 (one would
exclude the parameters 00, 6; and 02, and set them as some
functions of Bus and M for a given neutron star).

The mass and radius of the neutron star are 1.4Mo
and 10° cm, correspondingly. In what follows, the case of
1 = 3 corresponding to the dipole magnetic field is consid-
ered. It is supposed that T, = 1 keV, which is of the order
of magnitude equal to the real electron temperature in the
flow above the emitting region. It is set that y = 0.98. The
v(rup) quantity is considered as a parameter in the partic-
ular case, where v(rup) = 1.3 x 10° em s~'. Higher values
of the mass accretion rate as well as distinct values of the
surface magnetic field strength, the radius of the funnel base

and the thickness of the filled part of the hollow funnel will
be considered in a separate paper.

2.3. Numerical approach

Computations are performed with the use of the time-
relaxation method. The initial spectrum in the medium is
the Wien distribution for the temperature of 1 keV. At each
time step, to find the velocity with the use of (2) at a given
point in space for some spectral distribution, the total ra-
diation energy density is determined by expression (3). The
electron number density is eliminated in (2) with the use
of (4). After integrating the momentum equation, the elec-
tron temperature is found with the use of (21) over the en-
tire computational domain (the Stefan-Boltzmann law is not
used anywhere except for calculating the value of To).

To find the photon occupation number at each time
step, an explicit finite-difference scheme developed by G2021
is used, with additions and modifications related to the phys-
ical picture of the problem and aimed at the approximation
of the radiative transfer equations (5) in their specific form
considered here. There is no the sense to write out the di-
mensionless form of the equations, since the example of such
a representation can be found by the reader in the mentioned
paper (the grids are similar with accuracy to the steps used).
For a given i, the term describing thermal and second-order
bulk Comptonization is rewritten after performing differen-
tiation as a sum of terms, each of which contains a deriva-
tive of the dimensionless spectral radiation energy density
of only one order or does not contain its derivatives of an
order higher zeroth. These terms are approximated, as well
as the advection and first-order bulk Comptonization terms,
according to the typical rules (Press ct al. 1992; Samarskii
2001; Kalitkin 1978). The terms containing the derivatives
of the cross sections G; with respect to € are taken into ac-
count. In each transfer equation, the n? nonlinearity origi-
nates three monomials, one of which contains the product
of the dimensionless spectral radiation energy density and
its first derivative approximated by the central difference,
and the others contain the specified function squared. To
approximate the spatial diffusion terms (see (6)), the pat-
tern functionals containing the arithmetic means (Samarskii
1962) are basically used — the results are nearly identical to
those obtained by means of the approximation after differ-
entiation of the brackets.

The codes for simulating the accretion columns were
written in C and executed in parallel with the use of
OpenMP. The calculations were performed using total capa-
bilities of two 56-core (AMD EPYC 7663) CPUs. The com-
pute time of all simulations presented is about three months.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Accretion column in the radiation-dominated
regime

The dynamical picture of the problem is known. Consider
a freely falling flow. Let X-ray photons be generated at the
base of the funnel, and let their total luminosity be deter-
mined by the expression (1) (a separate consideration of the
case when photons are produced in the region of a certain

MNRAS 000, 1-19 ()
Radiation-dominated polar emitting region of an accreting X-ray pulsar-I 7

height above the atmosphere is omitted). An increase in the
accretion rate and the X-ray luminosity causes an increase of
the role of the pressure of the radiation propagating upward.
The flow begins to slow higher up, and the X-ray photons
escaping the funnel begin to partially gain the energy in the
appearing region of small values of |V - v|, and even some-
what above it, in the near-divergence-free flow. A further
increase in the accretion rate provides an increase in the
fraction of photons gaining considerable energy in the shock
wave and thus an increasingly sharp convergence of the flow.
Once a sufficiently strong shock wave is formed, the settling
mound begins to arise, as a significant portion of the photons
penetrate beneath the shock. The seed free-free radiation is
always originated mostly inside the underlying atmosphere.
Photons appeared inside the settling mound accomplish ran-
dom walks before escaping after a time equal on average to
the mean diffusion time for the mound. As the accretion
rate increases further, the shock wave becomes steeper and
the peak height of the deceleration zone grows. Both effects
occur (up to achieving some state), since the profile of the
shock wave must provide the illumination of the radiation
for a given accretion luminosity. A relatively small part of
the pre-shock kinetic energy of protons is converted into the
thermal energy of electrons. Within the shock, there is a
surface where the supersonic decelerating flow becomes sub-
sonic (the speed of sound in a radiation-dominated plasma
is cs = 2/3,/u/(mpne))

The spectrum of the radiation in the column is almost
entirely determined by the Compton energy exchange be-
tween electrons and photons. Modelling the radiative trans-
fer in the hot rarefied plasmas in the presence of a strong
magnetic field leads to results for the emergent spectrum dis-
tinguishing from those for a nonmagnetized medium, mainly
in the consequence of the dependence of the differential scat-
tering cross sections on polarization, frequency, directions
of propagation of incoming and outgoing photons, mag-
netic field strength, electron temperature and mass density
(Mészdros 1992). The dependence of the cross sections on
the electron temperature is of importance mostly for mod-
elling the radiative transfer in the vicinity of cyclotron reso-
nances, whose broadening is more remarkable, the higher the
electron temperature. The Compton y-parameter character-
ising thermal Comptonization in the continuum (e.g. Ry-
bicki & Lightman 1979) is reduced considerably compared
to the nonmagnetic value for both modes at frequencies well
less than the cyclotron frequency. Even for values of the
nonmagnetic y-parameter much exceeding unity, under the
conditions of the hard thermal backlight and static isother-
mal medium, magnetic Comptonization can cause an emer-
gent spectrum summed over the modes, which has a nearly
power-law shape at high frequencies. The general descrip-
tion of Comptonization in strongly magnetized plasmas is
rather complicated and remains beyond the scope of this
paper.

Geometrically 2D models of the radiation-dominated
accretion column differ from 1D models by that the 2D
model settling zone is surrounded by the shock wave and,
thus, completely submerged in the flow, so that there is no
direct path between that zone and the outer space. Such
models should be of interest in light of finding their rela-
tionship to observational data.

The model developed here is applicable for values of

MNRAS 000, 1-19 ()

the parameters which provide at least the very beginning of
originating the settling zone. For the total luminosity of two
identical columns one can write that

Lx ~ Mv? (rup). (30)

For the case of a freely falling pre-shock flow one has
Lx % 2L. At reasonable choice of rup expression (30) charac-
terises approximately, in principle, any emitting region re-
gardless that whether it being in the radiation-dominated
state or not. The specific of the radiation-dominated column
is that the temperature To is relatively higher than calcu-
lated for the same parameters the effective temperature of

3.2 Results of the numerical calculations

The solutions to system of equations (2), (3), (4), (5) and
(21) with boundary conditions (22), (23), (24), (26), (28)
and (29) (or (25) instead of both (24) and (28)) are consid-
ered. The main results of the current simulations are shown
in Figs 1-4. The local spectrum throughout the column is
plotted in terms of the spectral radiation energy density in
some points. The spectral luminosities L-, Lc, i represent the
sidewalls-integrated emergent continuum, and the polariza-

tion fraction is defined as

The boundaries of the colour bars related to the 2D dis-
tributions indicate the minimum and maximum values ap-

proached within the shown domains (for the velocity, these
values fall within the corresponding boundary intervals).
The difference between 00, 6: and 92 in calculations and
their values indicated above lies within the grid steps. Seed-
iness at the front of the shock wave in the electron tempera-
ture distributions is the trace of the colour interpolation and
is neither a manifestation of the scheme instabilities nor a
property of the grid functions.

For a filled funnel rs(rup) = 1.2 (Lx,37 © 3.1 for
Mir =1, Lx,37 © 9.3 for Mir = 3, an Lx,37 © 15.6 for
Mi; = 5), where Lx,37 = Lx /10°" erg s-'. In the case of
a hollow funnel r«(rup) = 1.007 (Lx,37 © 3.7 for Miz = 1).
The luminosity is given here for v(rup) = va(rup). The spec-
tral luminosity shown below for a hollow funnel is calculated

as the sum of the luminosities of the side boundaries. The
labels ‘we, ;’ and ‘L<,;’ are dropped in the figures.

The self-consistent approach used allows to simulate a
specific profile of the shock wave corresponding to the fre-
quency dependence of the cross sections for a given B(r) and
to the local spectrum formed. The calculated characteristic

8  M. Gornostaev

values of V - v correspond approximately to those obtained
in the grey approximation for rather large cross section along
the magnetic field ~ 0.301r-o7r (e.g. Davidson 1973). The
growth of the column slows down as the accretion rate in-
creases in the considered range of its values mainly due to
the frequency dependence of the cross sections along the
magnetic field. The growth virtually comes out to the satu-
ration taking place at Miz in the range 3-5 (Figs 2 and 3).
The vertical widening of the flow in the non-uniform mag-
netic field, and the effects of the frequency photon redis-
tribution and the heating of the plasma always make the
dependence of the height of the mound on the accretion
rate less steep compared to the simple solutions of Postnov
et al. (2015), but do not lead to its strong slowing down at
Mir 2 1 being taken into account under the grey approxi-
mation.

The polarimetric spectrum demonstrates typically an
excess of the radiation of the extraordinary mode at energies
near the maximum of the spectrum of that mode and pre-
vailing the ordinary mode at high energies. The dependence
of the radiation flux on the photon energy at low energies
«x €? is always the same for both modes. At low accretion
rates, the emergent spectra of both modes have the maxi-
mums at energies not exceeding strongly the value ~ kTo.
With increasing accretion rate, the shape of spectrum of
the extraordinary mode varies insignificantly at low energies
with hardening the tail, while the spectrum of the ordinary
mode gradually tends to saturation. The high-energy tails
are formed by the effects of bulk motion and thermal Comp-
tonization. While the spectrum of the ordinary mode is quite
far from saturation, the frequency behaviour of the used
cross sections causes that the total spectrum falls steeply
below the ‘averaged’ cyclotron line energy which thus mani-
fests in the absence of resonance in the cross sections. In the
spectrum of the extraordinary mode that feature is held for
any M. It should be modified in exactly calculated spectra
by the cyclotron line and wings of the line.

The growth of the accretion rate from M7 =1 to
Mir = 5 causes a decrease in the spectral hardness calcu-
lated as the ratio of the luminosity in the range 5-12 keV
to luminosity in the range 1-3 keV with increasing M with
going out to an almost constant.! A softening occurs as the
relative contribution of the ordinary mode to the luminos-
ity decreases in the range 5-12 keV faster than in the range
1-3 keV during a tending to the saturation of the spectrum
of the ordinary mode (a hardening of the total spectral tail)
at increasing M and fixed other parameters.

It follows from the description above that, in simu-
lations, the lower accretion rate, the lower absolute val-
ues of PF are reached (Figs 1-3). That is, unsaturated
Comptonization of the radiation of the ordinary mode can
result in an emergent spectrum comparably close to the
spectrum of the extraordinary mode (at least at Maz Si,
Figs 1, 4, 5 and 6). It is especially clear in the case
of the near-critical value of the accretion rate Mir = 0.2
(r«(Tup) = 1.15, Lx,37 © 0.7), see Fig. 6. The calculated PF
in the range 1-20 keV is in a satisfactory agreement with

et al. (2015). The minimum and maximum energies are close to
the boundaries of the RXTE/ASM energy band.

theoretical that of Burnard et al. (1991) and with character-
istic observational values (e.g. Tsygankov et al. 2022; Long
et al. 2023).

The first vacuum frequency (Ventura, Nagel & Meszaros
1979) falls in the soft X-ray range in the considered cases.
Hence the potential effect of the conversion of the cross sec-
tions between the vacuum frequencies is trivial and reduces
to recalling the spectra of the modes above the first vacuum
frequency.

3.3. Effects of induced scattering and of the
magnetic field geometry

The present simulations self-consistently show that in gen-
eral the influence of the induced Compton effect on the
structure of the accretion column and the radiation spec-
trum in the funnel cannot be neglected. Inside the settling
mound, far enough from the shock wave, Compton scatter-
ings establish a state close to LTE, with induced scattering
can play a notable role. That is, in the specified region one
has

ar

THTo~ (2) ~To, (34)

as it could be expected based on the smallness of the radia-
tion flux there. The total local spectrum can be rather close
to the Planck spectrum or have a characteristic saturated
form in this region, but approach neither the Planck nor
the Wien distribution. In the latter case, the spectrum has
a zone of less steep slope than in the Rayleigh-Jeans range
(e.g. Figs 2, 3 and 7).

Fig. 8 shows the results for the electron temperature
in the filled funnel along the magnetic axis and for the
corresponding emergent spectrum (cf. Zel’dovich & Illari-
onov 1974; Klein et al. 1996), obtained in a geometrically
2D domain under the grey approximation analogously to
the calculations of G2021 (section 3, the system of equa-
tions includes the only transfer equation), but with taking
into account the induced Compton effect, second-order bulk
Comptonization, free-free processes with the use of (11), the
cyclotron emission with the use of (15), and the dipole ge-
ometry of the magnetic field. The scattering cross section
along the magnetic field equal to 0.lor is used. Such cal-
culations being performed without taking into account the
induced Compton effect do not show an agreement of the
dependencies for the model Compton temperature in the
settling mound (Fig. 8) with the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Ne-
glecting free-free processes leads to an additional decrease in
the model Compton temperature. This is in accordance with
its values ~ 0.2-2 keV (at the typical radiation energy den-
sity of about 2.6 x 1017-4 x 10!” erg em™, which is nearly
constant throughout the settling zone) appeared in the re-
sults of G2021 (figs 5 and 6), which thus contain the spectra
of a shock wave itself with a soft backlight (cf. Lyubarskii &
Syunyaev 1982).

The grey approximation allows thus modelling a local
situation in the column that would be rather close to a sit-

uation without a strong magnetic field at least accurate to
the details of the shock profiles. It is justified regardless of
the value of the scattering cross section along the magnetic
field (as long as that value is not too small), the value of the

That is, in a sufficiently weak magnetic field, induced scat-
tering is of great importance for establishing of the electron
temperature in the interiors of the settling mound.

It turns out that thermal Comptonization cannot pro-
vide the existence of a satisfactory self-consistent steady-
state solutions while the induced Compton effect is ignored,
except for some special cases corresponding usually to rel-
atively low accretion rates Miz <2. The decrease in the
angle-averaged scattering cross sections with frequency in
both modes causes that in a sufficiently strong magnetic
field, in the models without allowance for induced scatter-
ing (when a solution exists), the model photons lose the
energy in the settling mound slowly, therefore the deficit in
the electron temperature relative to the exact solutions is

MNRAS 000, 1-19 ()

not dramatic for those models and can approach no much
than ~ 1 keV even for the solutions not accounting for the
free-free processes (Fig. 9).

The value of u in the settling zone decreases with in-
creasing r the slower, the lesser the | quantity. The mound
is lower than in the cylindrical channel at the same param-
eters (the area of the transverse cross section of the cylin-
drical channel is assumed to be equal to the area of the fun-
nel base). The radiation flux component along the magnetic
field differs from zero in the interiors of the settling mound,
consequently, mostly due to the geometry of the magnetic
field.

Within the shock wave, the effect of induced scattering
is insignificant at any magnetic field, since the ni quanti-
ties are small at the large radiation fluxes. The influence

of the anisotropy of the photon occupation numbers, which
is mostly determined by the squares of those and by the
coordinate, should not then change the results for the elec-
tron temperature strongly (see Levich & Sunyaev 1970 for
expressions for a dot source).

Taking into account the induced Compton effect in the
radiative transfer treatments was performed earlier in the
framework of static models of emitting regions (Meszaros,
Pavlov & Shibanov 1989; Alexander, Meszaros & Bussard
1989).

3.4 Effects of bulk Comptonization

The thermal structure of the shock differs from the settling
region mainly because of the influence of first-order bulk
Comptonization (compressional ‘acceleration’ of photons)

(Blandford & Payne 1981a,b). This is one of the mecha-
nisms in addition to the thermal Doppler effect, which sup-
plies photons at high energies and causes the heating of the
plasma due to the recoil in the region of great values of
|V-v| to electron temperatures considerably exceeding the
values of the (u/ar)'/* quantity and the value of Tp.

Second-order bulk Comptonization occurs mostly in the
upper, relatively cold layers of the shock wave and in a
rather narrow low-intensity layer of the pre-shock region
from where the radiation is still capable of contributing
to the emergent flux. In principle, it is possible to model
approximately the structure of the shock by solving self-
consistently the transfer equations of sort of equations (5),
ignoring both thermal and second-order bulk Comptoniza-
tion — in such solutions the emergent spectra of both modes
have the power-law tails, which is in accordance with the

results of Blandford & Payne (1981b) and Becker & Wolff
(2005).

Compared to the results where second-order bulk
Comptonization is neglected, the peak height of the calcu-
lated shock above the neutron star surface is relatively larger
(the typical difference is described by a factor of 2), while
the calculated electron temperature in the shock wave is rel-
atively higher (and typically differs by 1.5-2 times), which
indicates the increase in the density of hard photons (form-
ing eventually the tail of the spectrum of the funnel). The
quantities T and T + mev/(3k) become almost equal at the
value of r (at a given @) at which the value of T’ approaches
its maximum. The corresponding contour is close to the in-
ner boundary of the shock wave. Above that contour, one
can distinguish another level where the dominance of the

mev*/3 term is relieved by the dominance of the electron
temperature. An excess of hard photons in the upper part

MNRAS 000, 1-19 ()

of the settling mound manifests in a spreading of the inner
boundary of the temperature shock or (in relatively weak
fields) in a smaller altitude of this boundary in comparison
to the velocity shock. The Tog quantity approaches a maxi-
mum in the outer layers of the shock, which indicates that
as the hard radiation penetrates against the accretion flow
into the region above the shock wave, losing in the photon
number density.

In the absence of a magnetic field, first-order bulk
Comptonization would be the reason of a shift in the max-
imum of the emergent spectrum toward higher energies rel-
ative to the characteristic energy 2.8kTp. This is a typical
picture (see Psaltis & Lamb 1999, fig. 1). In a strong mag-
netic field this effect takes place as well. The emergent spec-
trum of the extraordinary mode is shifted to higher energies
relative to the value of kTp mainly due to the influence of
first-order bulk Comptonization, while the thermal effect of

the shock wave is not very significant for the shift. The spec-
trum of the ordinary mode can be affected by the heating of
the shock wave. If a high-energy hump in the emergent spec-
trum of the ordinary mode is formed, it usually corresponds
to the energy ~ 2kT3, where Ts is the maximum electron
temperature (approaching in the shock wave).

Thus, second-order bulk Comptonization leads to an in-
crease in the intensity in the high-energy tails (both directly
and through the heating of the medium) compared to the
tails formed by first-order bulk and thermal Comptoniza-
tion. The high-energy tail of the total spectrum of intensi-
ties well above those of the extraordinary mode is formed as
well in the framework of self-consistent calculations with an
artificially cooled shock wave to a temperature of To or to
a temperature taken to be equal to (u/ar)'/*. The high col-
umn in such simulations is not formed, so that the resulting

‘shock wave’ lies on the neutron star surface — this shows
that the heating of the shock wave at least in the correspon-
dence with solutions of G2021 is the necessary condition for
the formation of the dynamical structure (in contrast to the
heating of the post-shock zone).

The influence of the mev?/3 term can be illustrated
by varying the velocity at the upper boundary. Con-

tence of solutions in the framework of the model. Although

spectral tail remains nevertheless rather hard, and the PF
distribution is similar to that given in Fig. 2. The possibil-
ity of the distinction of v(rup) from the free-fall velocity was
mentioned by Poutanen et al. (2013).

Within the models constructed under the grey approx-
imation, the influence of the mev?/3 term on the formation
of the emergent spectrum (see an example in Fig. 8) mani-
fests by adding a hard-energy tail to the typical quasi-Bose-
Einstein distribution.

3.5 Free-free processes and the cyclotron emission

Free-free processes cause the increase in the brightness tem-
perature of the emergent spectrum at the energies less
~ 0.5 keV in comparison to the case of pure scattering. It
is shown clearly in the grey approximation (Fig. 8), in the
framework of which the low energies are considered. The
density of matter in the post-shock region is insufficient to
make the free-free absorption an efficient mechanism of heat-
ing the plasma. Figs 7 and 9 represent the results of com-
putations with free-free and cyclotron processes neglected.
It is clear from these results that neglecting free-free pro-
cesses within the model does not vary the output distribu-
tions strongly and, thus, that the Compton energy exchange
under the conditions of the local Compton equilibrium is
the main mechanism of the heating of the plasma in the
column (§ 3.3).

A more pronounced manifestation of free-free interac-
tions could be obtained with the parameters differ from used
here. This will be studied in the separate work. The jeyc,i
terms cause only a small relative increase in the height of

MNRAS 000, 1-19 ()

the mound (up to ~ 5%) compared to the solution for the
terms neglected. The combined action of free-free processes
and the cyclotron emission leads to the model structures of
a practically identical height for the cases considered (Figs 2
and 7), which is not the case in general (although there are
no major differences expected).

Notice that the contribution of the overall seed ra-
diation to the radiation energy density at the bottom is
included in (27). Therefore, y should insignificantly differ
for the case of neglecting free-free processes inside the col-
umn (Fig. 7). The corresponding difference is small and ne-
glected.

4 DISCUSSION
4.1 The model

The overall picture of matter breaking in the radiation-
dominated regime is thus as follows. Five zones can be distin-
guished in the accretion channel above the magnetic pole:
(1) the cold accretion flow falls near-freely in a radiation
field of relatively low energy densities; (2) the flow begins to
fluently brake in the shock, but its electron temperature is
not yet very high; predominantly, the effect of second-order
bulk Comptonization in this zone leads to the formation of
the tails in the emergent continuum; (3) the flow experiences
the rather sharp braking in high-density layers of the shock
wave up to a near-complete stop, photons gain the energy
in this zone due to first-order and second-order bulk Comp-
tonization, and by thermal Comptonization; the plasma can
be heated to 10-20 keV and higher by means of the bulk

heating mechanism there; (4) the matter falls, slowing down
further, within a settling mound surrounded by the shock
wave and the neutron star surface; as the matter settles, the
electron temperature gradually approaches thermodynami-
cally equilibrium one and becomes typically 1.5—4 times less
than the temperature in the shock wave; (5) the plasma pen-
etrates through the magnetic field beyond the channel near
the base of the emitting region.

The assumption of LTE is a typical example of that
which cannot actually work in the shock wave. Thus, Zhang
et al. (2021) have used the Stefan-Boltzmann law to write
the radiation temperature for the balance equation, which
caused the obtaining of too low electron temperature in the
shock, where the Compton heating and cooling must be
modelled, with the bulk heating mechanism (Blandford &
Payne 1981b) must be taken into account. The velocity pro-

files in the solutions without allowing for modelling thermal
Comptonization are not very sensitive to the assumption
on the electron temperature, since the radiative diffusive
and enthalpy fluxes must not be strongly dependent on it
(Davidson 1973; Arons et al. 1987). Corresponding transfer
equation for the total radiation energy density is obtained
from the transfer equation for the spectral radiation energy
density under the assumption about the Compton equilib-
rium (Appendix A).

The system of equations analysed by Zhang et al. (2021)
(appendix A) corresponds to equations of G2021, but ac-
counts for the effects of the gravitational acceleration and
viscosity (the scattering is assumed to be isotropic). The
viscosity terms are neglected during the consideration of the
origination of photon bubbles in the WKB approximation.
Since the development of photon bubble instability is related

to perturbations of the mass density and total radiation flux,
its description should not be strongly dependent on the par-
ticular results for the electron temperature.

The process of the going out of the plasma beyond
the column needs to be modelled in detail in the frame-
work of MHD simulations. Simple estimates were made by
Lyubarskii & Syunyaev (1988). One can obtain that the
mass growing above the neutron star crust can originate be-
tween outpourings a dense gas-dominated non-steady ther-
malized layer of the height H < 2kTR?/(GMm,) © 60 em
(for the constant temperature taken for the upper part of the

layer and set to be equal 6 keV). This layer, or ‘the thermal
mound’ (Becker 1998), can be ignored in the calculations of
the radiation transfer in the funnel, since its altitude is small
and the energy exchange throughout the medium above the
layer is significant.

The radiation energy density corresponding to the post-
shock velocity ~ 1/7 of the pre-shock value cannot serve for
the implementation of the bottom boundary condition, since
this post-shock value of the velocity was obtained for an
infinite shock wave in free space (e.g. Zel’dovich & Raizer
1967). The circumstances of X-ray pulsars (e.g. the bound-

edness of the settling mound by the neutron star surface,
the transverse boundedness of the gas flow, the presence of
a magnetic field) lead to y ~ 1. The used value of 7 leads to
v(R) of ~ 3 x 108-4 x 10° cm s~!. A reasonable variation in
7 in both directions cannot change the results considerably
(for y > 0.99 a steady solution does not often exist yet).

The model described in Sections 2 and 3 does not imply
the consideration and solution of the energy equation for the
total radiation energy density (Appendix A). One can guess
that its inclusion and thus the transition to solving two sep-
arate problems (obtaining the velocity profile, e.g. Davidson
(1973), and then self-consistent calculation of the electron
temperature and spectral radiation energy density) may ap-
pear more useful in some studies. Nevertheless, the method
described in the present paper guarantees full compliance o:
all obtained distributions in the framework of hydrodynam-
ical approach, providing better, as well as joint, fulfilment
of the Liouville theorem. The self-consistent solutions take
into account the result of calculating the realistic frequency
photon redistribution, in contrast to the spectrum-integral
approaches including the equations of a form of those o:
Appendix A.

As is clear from above, in the calculations aimed
to obtain the dynamical structure and carried out with
the use of the grey approximation it would be reason-
able to use the scattering cross section along the field
pretty close to the Planck and Rosseland means of the o1
quantity to achieve correct characteristic values of V-v.
The Planck mean reads (o1)p = 40/21 (tkT/ecye)?or for
écye/(kT) well exceeding 7/2, and the Rosseland mean
reads (o1)R = 4/5 (tkT /écyc)"or for €cyc/(kT) well exceed-
ing a. The polarization-averaged Planck and Rosseland
means calculated for the accurate magnetic opacities were
presented by Suleimanov et al. (2022).

To obtain the results shown in Fig. 8, the less scatiter-
ing cross section along the field compared with the specified
means was used for computational reasons, which caused
relatively more gentle profiles of the velocity within the

shock. The use of small values ~ 10~°or for that cross sec-
tion would lead to a very smooth shock profile, so that the
settling mound would be virtually absent. This means that
there is no the same grey equivalent for obtaining simul-
taneously for the case of a strong magnetic field both the
structure and the total spectrum, whose slope of the quasi-
exponentially fallen power-law corresponds at characteristic
values of the total y-parameter to a grey cross section along
the field much smaller than 10720.
The main drawback of the present work is the lack of
calculations of the radiative transfer at frequencies of the
cyclotron resonances, whose influence remains to be unstud-
ied. In general, those calculations should be associated with
the accurate scattering and absorption cross sections for a
hot magnetized plasma calculated in the temperature range
characteristic for the column (e.g. Schwarm et al. 2017;
Suleimanov et al. 2022; Mushtukov et al. 2022; Mészaros
1992). In principle, it is not difficult to incorporate into the
codes the cross sections containing the cyclotron resonance
(resonances) instead of the used cross sections, for which
there is the only nuisance associated with the corresponding
glaring retardation of the convergence. Another lack of the
model developed is the description of the radiative transfer
in the non-relativistic Fokker-Planck approximation. Comp-
tonization is modelled using the angle-averaged cross sec-
tions, which is rather crude applied to the ordinary mode
(variation of this quantity in the pretty wide range, how-
ever, does not affect the results dramatically). Solving a sys-
tem of equations similar to that described in Section 2 and
including the integro-differential transfer equations written
for a moving medium of the funnel instead of expansions (5)
would yield more accurate results containing angular dis-
tributions of the radiation intensity. Furthermore, the rela-
tivistic description of the radiative transfer should be used.
Although the photon energy dependence of the cross
sections for both modes plays a crucial role in the spectrum
formation, the role of terms containing the photon energy
derivatives of the angle-averaged cross sections is insignifi-
cant. The mode switching is taken into account using the
results of studies on the coupled-diffusion approximation
of the radiative transfer (Nagel 1981; Kaminker, Pavlov &
Shibanov 1982; Mészéros 1992).
A few remarks should be made on the alternative calcu-
lations. A drawback of the existing 1D numerical and ana-
lytical models is that, in the framework of them, a significant
part of the photons leave the column directly from the side-
wall of the zone of the slowly falling gas, without crossing
the shock wave, as was noted above. This process is often de-
scribed by a term in the transfer equation written by means
of the averaged diffusion time across the column (Becker &
Wolff 2007; Farinelli et al. 2016; West et al. 2017b). A simi-
lar simple picture is typical for dynamical models of Basko
& Sunyaev (1976) and Tsygan (1977) constructed by means
of averaging the radiation flux across the magnetic field.
Calculations of the emergent spectrum with the use of 1D
models may take into account the dynamical effects in the
insufficient extent. Such models open a way to fit easily a
vast amount of observations.
The solutions of Lyubarskii (1986) were obtained under
the assumption of a fenomenological dependence of the pho-
ton occupation number on the optical depth. The shape of
the obtained spectra at frequencies less than the frequency

of maximum is artificial. The dynamical effects were not
considered. These results led to the lack in important de-
tails in describing the formation of a continuum carried out
by Postnov et al. (2015) (the radiation of the ordinary mode
advected downwards in the shock wave was totally ignored).

4.2 On the fit of observations

The high-energy tails, expanding mainly due to the influ-
ence of second-order bulk Comptonization, can become an
obstacle to fit observed fallen quasi-power-law spectra with
the developed model. The received flux in the tails is often
relatively low (e.g. Kiihnel et al. 2017). If future simula-
tions taken into account angular photon redistribution and
cyclotron resonances do not lead to better agreement with
observations at usual problem parameters, this will mean
that either the velocity at the top boundary may be distin-
guished noticeably from the free-fall velocity (and then the
simplest solution is in the parametrization of the velocity
at the top) or the realistic profiles of the shock are much
more complicated than obtained here and must be found in
the spectral radiative transfer simulations coupled with the
MHD simulations. An experimental explanation may con-
sist in the absence of the corresponding observational data.
The obtained hardness of the spectrum taken near the en-
ergies 10 keV and 1 keV may exceed the observational value
because of ignoring the reproduction of the radiation in the
atmosphere of a neutron star, whose the albedo is charac-
terised by a low-frequency cutoff (Postnov et al. 2015).
Recently, the observed continuum of the radiation from
the X-ray pulsar 1A 0535+262 generated during the giant
outburst and having a high-energy spectral maximum at
energies of ~ 20-30 keV has been described by Kong et al.
(2022) and Shui et al. (2024). Another well-known source
with similar spectral properties is V 0332+53 (Doroshenko
et al. 2017). As an interpretation, one can consider the radi-
ation with a spectral maximum in the vicinity of the max-
imum of the spectrum of the extraordinary mode from a
strongly heated emitting region of a relatively small area
(bulk Comptonization can contribute in the displacement of
the maximum as described above). The approximate exam-
ples of the continuum of the corresponding form are shown in
Fig. 4. The significant negative correlation of the CRSF en-
ergy with the X-ray luminosity within such a hot spectrum,
being considered in the model directly relating the CRSF
centroid energy to the height of the column, would imply a
significant absolute difference in the height of the column in
the considered states, which cannot be demonstrated by the
narrow hollow column. (The relatively small height of the
hollow columns was previously obtained in numerical simu-
lations of Postnov et al. 2015.) The possible solution seems
in taking into consideration the distortions in the magnetic
field strength occurring in the column (see examples of so-
lutions of the Grad-Shafranov equation for preset mounds
obtained by Mukherjee et al. 2013a and Mukherjee, Bhat-
tacharya & Mignone 2013b). Weaker magnetic fields appear-
ing with increasing M would explain the observed anticor-
relation of the CRSF energy with the X-ray luminosity. The
check is to become the aim of further self-consistent MHD
simulations.
Preliminary simulations in the current model with the
surface value of the magnetic field strength less than consid-

ered above (it was set écyc(R) = 10 keV) lead to the two-
hump total emergent spectrum with the location of the
CRSF in the spectral saddle. The exact spectral shape is to
e modelled in the framework of upcoming studies, which
will also include the effects of complicated (non-dipole) ge-
ometry of a magnetic field.

Theoretical models of the column with a collisionless
shock wave also lead to solutions corresponding very strong
heating of the plasma (often up to tens of keV) during pass-
ing the shock wave (Langer & Rappaport 1982; Bykov &
Krasil’shchikov 2004). In these models, the hot material fills
the entire post-shock zone up to the neutron star atmo-
sphere, which may be another problem for the interpreta-
tion of the observational data. In the calculations of Vy-
ornov et al. (2017) using the Feautrier method, the elec-
tron temperature was parametrized to fit the observational
spectra and appeared to be rather low (5-6 keV). Detailed
self-consistent modelling of the spectrum of the radiation
rom the column with the collisionless shock is the problem
that remains to be solved.

The formation at temperatures ~ T.¢—To and under cir-
cumstances not considered here of the spectra having the
maximum in corresponding to these temperatures spectral
range and a high-energy power-law should be studied fur-
ther.

5 CONCLUSIONS

The accretion regime on to a strongly magnetized neutron
star corresponding to luminosities above the value of Ler
has been considered. The main processes within the mag-
netic polar funnels have been investigated. The transfer
equations for the polarized radiation have been numerically
solved within the considered domains self-consistently with
the expressions for the electron temperature and the radia-
tion energy density, the momentum equation, and the conti-
nuity equation. The solutions obtained describe the dynam-
ical and thermal structure both of the radiation-dominated
shock wave and the settling mound, and the polarimetric
X-ray continuum of radiation that emerges from the funnel.

It has been found that the peak height of the the model
accretion column, being calculated taking into account the
specific form of the frequency- and polarization-dependent
scattering cross sections, can depend nonlinearly on the ac-
cretion rate, in contrast to the nearly linear outputs obtained
in the grey approximation. In the case of a sufficiently strong
magnetic field, the saturation in the column peak height—
accretion rate dependence takes place in the studied range
of the accretion rate.

The significance of the Compton scatterings within the
accretion column is as great as it is characteristic, for exam-
ple, for the early universe. Comptonization has been shown
to be the main process for the formation of the tempera-
ture structure of the column. The electrons are in the ther-
modynamic equilibrium with the radiation deep below the
shock wave, as proofed in the way of using the Compton-
equlibrium formula for obtaining the electron temperature,
which noticeably exceeds the blackbody value within the
shock due to the contribution of the effects of bulk motion
to the heating of the plasma.

The temperature structure should be calculated in gen-

eral case with taking into account the influence of the in-
duced Compton effect, which impact on the electron tem-
perature within the settling mound under the condition of
the sufficiently weak magnetic field and (in general case) on
the existence of the steady-state solutions of the problem.
The effects of second-order bulk Comptonization are impor-
tant mainly for the formation of the spectra of emergent ra-
diation, resulting in a smoothed power-law high-energy zone
with a cutoff. I have discussed main directions for updating
the results in the framework of more accurate models.

The calculated absolute value of the polarization frac-
tion lies between 0.05 and 0.5 being measured near the spec-
tral maximum of the extraordinary mode. The model de-
veloped can provide the emergent continuum of the ordi-
nary mode close to that of the extraordinary mode. Namely,
the calculations for the configuration of a geometrically thin
hollow column can lead to the spectrum of the funnel char-
acterised by a high-energy maximum and a low polariza-
tion fraction over the entire spectral range. The similar pic-
ture for the cooler spectra is typical for the filled radiation-
dominated column at sufficiently low accretion rates below
My = 1 that are close to the critical value.

APPENDIX A: EQUATIONS FOR THE TOTAL
RADIATION ENERGY DENSITY

The physical model considered above does not contain any
of transfer equations for the total radiation energy density.

MNRAS 000, 1-19 ()

Nevertheless, let us consider them, limiting to consideration
regardless of the polarization of radiation.

Let free-free and cyclotron processes be neglected and
the term of the second order in the bulk velocity be ignored.
Then it follows from the transfer equation (Blandford &
Payne 1981a) that in a steady situation (the subscript ‘np’
for the occupation number and radiation energy density will
be dropped)

where D is the diffusion tensor, the cross section o is repre-
sented analogously to expression (25) of Blandford & Payne
(1981a) with accuracy to accounting for the n? term, and

is the total radiation flux. If the momentum equation is con-
sidered in the form (2), then from (2) and (A3) one can

If the gravitational acceleration is not neglected, the mo-

which can easily be written out straightforwardly from the
energy conservation law, as well as (A5).

These equations are crudely valid while the flow is not
too dense, and hence free-free processes are not important.
Let us the second-order bulk Comptonization term is now
taken into account. Without specification of the terms taken
into account in the right-hand side of the momentum equa-
tion and of the way of the calculation of T’, one has for the
non-steady case (e.g. West et al. 2017b)
