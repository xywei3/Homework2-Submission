Abstract

We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of entanglement fluctuations in the v = 1
Quantum Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process, a free-fermion chain with hopping am-
plitudes that are stochastic in time but homogeneous in space. Previous work showed
that the average entanglement growth after a quantum quench can be explained in terms
of pairs of entangled quasiparticles performing random walks, leading to diffusive entan-
glement spreading. By incorporating the noise-induced statistical correlations between
the quasiparticles, we extend this description to the full-time probability distribution of
the entanglement entropy. Our generalized quasiparticle picture allows us to compute the
average time evolution of a generic function of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem.
We also apply our result to the entanglement asymmetry. This allows us to investigate
the restoration of particle-number symmetry in the dynamics from initial states with no
well-defined particle number, and the emergence of the quantum Mpemba effect.

1 Introduction

Quantum models with a unitary evolution driven by stochastic processes offer a promising
route to understanding the complex dynamics of out-of-equilibrium quantum systems. These
models are particularly useful for describing many-body systems interacting with their en-
vironment, providing valuable insights into the fluctuations of quantum diffusive dynamics.
While fluctuations in classical diffusive systems are well captured by Macroscopic Fluctuation
Theory [1], the existence of an analogous universal framework at the quantum level remains
unclear [2]. At the same time, random unitary dynamics are also useful for extracting and
analyzing the typical, universal properties of isolated many-body systems. By introducing
randomness, fine-grained, specific features of the system are filtered out, leaving only the
more generic ones — in some cases, randomness also gives analytical access to notoriously
difficult problems, such as entanglement growth. Randomness can be implemented in many
different ways: e.g. through random unitary circuits [3-10], or as continuous-time stochastic
Hamiltonian dynamics [11-21].

An ideal candidate of the second type for quantitatively studying fluctuations in diffusive
quantum dynamics is the Quantum Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process (QSSEP), introduced
in Refs. [13,22]. This is a system of free fermions hopping on a ring with hopping amplitudes
between neighboring sites that are random both in space and time. Since the Hamiltonian
generator of the dynamics is quadratic, the model is free-fermionic for each noise realization.
This opens the possibility of employing analytic methods and performing efficient numerical
simulations. Remarkably, the average dynamics of the state reproduces that of the SSEP,
its classical counterpart [23]. Still, understanding the genuine quantum aspects of the model

such as the fluctuations of the state dynamics or the entanglement — is also crucial [24
26]. The full statistics of the fluctuations of both the stationary state and the stationary
entanglement entropy have been determined [22,27]. However, the full-time evolution of the
entanglement is still missing.

The exact full-time dynamics of the average entanglement entropy has been derived ana-
lytically in a generalization of the QSSEP model, recently introduced in Ref. [28], in which
the hopping amplitudes are random in time but homogeneous in space; thereby, the model is
translationally invariant, in contrast to the original QSSEP (see Refs. [29-33] for other exten-
sions). One can relax this property and only partially restore spatial invariance by considering
the same random hoppings every v sites rence the name v-QSSEP given in Ref. [28]. The
case vy = 1 corresponds to homogeneous random hoppings; for v = 2, the noise in odd and
even sites is different; and in the limit v > ov, the original QSSEP model is recovered. The
dynamics of the averaged entanglement entropy in the vy = 1 case can be interpreted in terms
of a stochastic generalization of the quasiparticle picture that explains entanglement spreading
in the non-random counterpart of this model [34-37]. While in that case the quasiparticles
propagate ballistically, leading to a linear growth of entanglement, here they follow a ran-
dom walk in each realization, implying that entanglement spreads diffusively. Although an
exact description of the average entanglement dynamics for generic v is still lacking, the same
qualitative behavior is observed.

In the present work, we continue the characterization of the entanglement dynamics in the
v = 1 QSSEP model. In particular, we analytically derive the full-time probability distribution
of the entanglement entropy after a quench from an initial product state. To this end, we
adapt the stochastic generalization of the quasiparticle picture developed in Ref. [28]. As
we will show, the crucial ingredient for computing entanglement fluctuations is the inclusion
of the statistical correlations between the pairs of entangled quasiparticles, see Fig. 1 for an
illustration. This represents a key novelty compared to the case of the average entanglement,
or the non-random system, where the pairs are assumed to be uncorrelated.

This approach also allows us to investigate other interesting aspects of the v = 1 QSSEP
model. Here, we further apply it to investigate how particle-number symmetry is restored
in the stationary state when the initial configuration breaks it a problem that has re-
cently attracted significant attention. To monitor the restoration of symmetry, we employ
the entanglement asymmetry, an observable that quantifies the extent to which the symmetry
is broken within a subsystem. Leveraging the diffusive quasiparticle picture, we derive the
full-time dynamics of the average asymmetry for generic initial squeezed states that break
particle-number symmetry. An intriguing phenomenon to explore in this context is the quan-
tum Mpemba effect, which occurs when, for a pair of initial states, symmetry is restored faster

At t = 0, entangled pairs of quasiparticles, each one associated with a momentum k, are
emitted and propagate diffusively. The distance £;(t) between the two quasiparticles
of a pair describes a real Brownian motion. Since (€j(t)&q(t)) 4 0, quasiparticles with
different momenta are statistically correlated. These correlations are key to describe the
fluctuations of the entanglement via Eq. (13), giving access to the moments (S'4(t)")
of the entanglement entropy at any time, and to the out-of-equilibrium evolution of the
average entanglement asymmetry.

in the state that initially breaks it more [38] (see Refs. [39,40] for a review of the different
manifestations of the quantum Mpemba effect and Ref. [41] for a unifying approach to them).
This particular version of the effect has been observed in various systems — including free
and integrable models [42-50], open, monitored, and driven systems [51-54], quantum cir-
cuits [55-61], disorder and long-range spin chains [62-65], and even experimentally [66,67]
as well as in the non-random analogue of the vy = 1 QSSEP. We determine the microscopic
conditions for its occurrence in terms of the density of occupied modes of the initial squeezed
states and compare them with the non-random case.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we introduce the vy = 1 QSSEP. In Sec. 3,
after reviewing the results on the average entanglement entropy reported in Ref. [28], we
extend the diffusive quasiparticle picture that describes it to include the noise-induced corre-
lations between quasiparticle pairs, and we apply this framework to compute the full counting
statistics of the entanglement entropy. In Sec. 4, we use this quasiparticle picture to study
the entanglement asymmetry after a quantum quench from particle-symmetry-breaking initial
states, and we determine the conditions under which the quantum Mpemba effect occurs in
the vy = 1 QSSEP model. We conclude in Sec. 5 with a summary and outlook. We include an
appendix that describes the numerical methods used in our calculations.

2 v-QSSEP model

In this section, we present the v-QSSEP model for v = 1 as originally introduced in Ref. [28].
As mentioned in the introduction, this model consists of a one-dimensional chain of L sites
with non-interacting spinless fermions and random complex hopping amplitudes that are
homogeneous in space but stochastic in time. The dynamics is, therefore, described by the
following infinitesimal Hamiltonian dH; which generates the time evolution,

L
di = vD>~ (aWeclejs1 + hc.) ; 1)
j=l

where c; (cl) are the standard annihilation (creation) operators of a spinless fermion at the
site 7. We consider periodic boundary conditions, cj;+; = c;. The hopping amplitude dW, is
a complex It6 increment satisfying dWi;dW; = dW dW; = 0 and dWidW; = dt. The constant
D tunes the size of the fluctuations of the noise and, as we discuss below, determines the time
scale of the time evolution. The density matrix p; = |v) (~,| that describes the state of the
full system thus evolves as

Pitas = eM pclae, 2)
In the following, we are interested in the out-of-equilibrium dynamics obtained by time evoly-
ing a lowly entangled initial state |qo). Since the Hamiltonian generator (1) is quadratic in
he fermionic operators, if the initial state is Gaussian, i.e. it satisfies Wick theorem, then
he time-evolved state (2) will remain Gaussian at all times [68,69].
This model has a global U(1) symmetry associated with the conservation of the total
particle number, i.e. [dH;,Q] = 0, with Q = D3, dey: First, to study the fluctuations of
entanglement, we will consider initial states with a definite number of particles for simplicity.
Later, we relax this assumption and analyze the evolution and restoration of this U(1) sym-
metry when the initial state breaks it. Due to the Gaussianity of the state at all times, all
he physical information is encoded in the two-point function Gram = (w| chem |b) when the
initial state has a definite number of particles. If the initial state violates the particle number
symmetry, then we must further take into account the correlations Frm = (W| nem |W). All
he observables that we will study in the following can be obtained from the knowledge of Gnm
and Fim, see Refs. [68,69] and also Appendix A for a discussion on the numerical techniques
used.

3 Diffusive quasiparticle picture for the entanglement statistics

In this section, we study the fluctuations of entanglement under the time evolution described
by Eq. (2). To this end, we divide the chain in two intervals A and B of length ¢ and L — @,
respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 1. In Ref. [28], it was found that the average entanglement
entropy between A and B under Eq. (2) can be described in terms of diffusively propagating
entangled pairs of quasiparticles in the scaling limit L,/,t + co with 0 = Dt/l finite. Here,
we show that such diffusive quasiparticle picture can be properly extended to determine the
full counting statistics of the entanglement entropy in that scaling limit.

Let us first review the original result derived in Ref. [28] for the average entanglement
entropy (S.4(t)). We consider a generic initial state with two-site translational invariance and
a definite number of particles, i.e. Fyn = 0, such as the Néel and the dimer states. Exploiting
the translational invariance of the generator of the time evolution (1), the two-point correlation
matrix Gpjm can be expressed in momentum space in the form

1 oe
Gn =e a » Geran (3)
ae

at all times. Due to the two-site translational invariance of the initial configuration, at t = 0
we have

Gg = 51) kg + 5910 (4)
with g(k — 7) = g(k)*. Let F(G,4) be a generic analytic function of the correlation matrix
restricted to the subsystem A, ie. (G4)mn = Gmn, m,n € A. Using the stationary phase
approximation [70], it can be shown that, for an infinite chain (i.e., in the thermodynamic
limit L — oo) in the diffusive scaling limit in which ¢,t + oo and 9 = Dt/C? is finite, the
expectation value of the trace of F(G4) is given by [28]

(mFGa)=5 f derce) fH max(e 216), FAs) + FO]
+min(2|€], 6) [F(f()/2) + F(f(k + )/2)]], (5)
where Ax are the eigenvalues of the matrix

_ (fle+0) gle+n)
o-( ak) f(k) ): 6)

and P(€,t) = eo 8 /4Dt H/ 47 Dt is the probability distribution function of a Gaussian random
variable with zero mean and variance 2Dt. If we now specialize the formula (5) to the
entanglement entropy, then we find the following time evolution for its average value,

(Sa(t)) = se / déP(E,t) min(2|é|/6,1), 7)

According to Eq. (7), the dynamics of the average entanglement entropy under Eq. (2) is
characterized by an initial y/t growth followed by a saturation, at a time t > (?, to the same
value predicted by the generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) in the case of non-random hopping
amplitudes [35,37].

As already mentioned, the results in Eqs. (5) and (7) admit a quasiparticle interpretation.
At t = 0, pairs of entangled quasiparticles are produced at each spatial point of the system and
then they travel diffusively, as shown in Fig. 1. The distance between the two quasiparticles
of a pair is 2|€| with a probability determined by the distribution P(€,t). Since for each noise
realization all the entangled pairs perform the same random walk, the number of pairs that
are fully contained within the subsystem A is max(¢— 2|€|,0), whereas the number of pairs
with one quasiparticle in region A and the other in B is min(2|€|,@). Therefore, the first
term in Eq. (5) is the contribution from the pairs that are fully contained inside A and the
second one corresponds to the contribution of the pairs that are shared between A and the
rest. The contribution of each pair is the same as in the non-random model. In particular, the
entanglement between A and B is given according to Eq. (7) by the number of quasiparticles
shared between these subsystems, i.e. min(2|é|, 2), multiplied by their contribution (8). Notice
that, unlike in the case of non-random hoppings, the dependence of the distance || on the
momentum k of the quasiparticles is completely washed away as a consequence of the average
over the noise. However, we will show that this will not be longer true when considering
averages of functions of the correlation matrix such as (Tr[F\(G4)] Tr[72(Ga)|---) or more
generically (h(Tr[F,(Ga)], Tr[F2(Ga)],---)), with h an analytic function of multiple variables.
The relevance of considering such expectation values relies on the fact that their knowledge
is crucial to the determination of the higher moments of the entanglement entropy (S.4(t)"),
and the presence of correlations between quasiparticles with different momentum will be the
key point in the generalization of Eq. (7).

The existence of a quasiparticle picture is hinted at by the presence of well-defined, stable
excitations at all times, regardless of the stochasticity of the hopping amplitudes dW;. The

dH, = So derncher, (9)
k

where dey, = VD(dWye* + dW ye**) = 2D Re{dWe"*} are real Ité increments that satisfy
de; ,dét,q = 2Ddtcos(k — q). The crucial point is that infinitesimal generators at different
times commute. Therefore, we can think of the excitations with momentum k as having a
stochastic energy €,, whose probability distribution is time-dependent. This energy is given
by ez(t) = VD(Wi e*§ 4+ Wire) = 2/D Rel Wi a where W; is the random variable
W, = Wrz t+ iWry and Wr 1),t describe independent real Brownian motions with zero mean
and variance Dt.
Based on this idea, to generalize the standard quasiparticle picture of the non-random
model [37], we observe that the distance €;, traveled by a quasiparticle with momentum k is
determined by the stochastic energy ¢,. Indeed, the infinitesimal distance is obtained from

q(t) = Open (t) = 2VD Re{W, e**}. (10)

Now, by considering a finite time interval, the probability distribution of & is independent
on k and it is given by P(€,t) as in Eq. (5), since W; is a complex Brownian motion. We
anticipate that this, in turn, implies that for observables linear in €%, the dependence on
k drops out. On the other hand, & = 2/DRe{Wie!"} and €; = 2VDRe{Wie'7} are not
independent, as follows from their definition. Let us see how to account for these statistical
correlations between quasiparticles. We consider again a generic analytic function F(G 44) of
the subsystem correlation matrix G4. From Eq. (5), we first define the function z7(€)

zr(6,) = 5 fF bmax(l — 2é4),0) FAs) + FQ]
+ min(2éel, 0) FF(8)/2)+ FUE + mI. (1)

Here Ax and f(k) are the same as in Eq. (5), but we have replaced € by & = Oxex(t) =

2VDRe{ Wie}. We conjecture that the average value of a generic analytical function h(-,-,...)
of traces of different functions F;(G4), j = 1,2,..., is given by
(A(Tr[Fi(Ga)], Tr[F2(Ga)], ue )) L PE Soo (h(zr, (Em), ®Fa (Eko), ut ))e; (12)

where we have introduced (-)@ as a shorthand notation for the average with respect to the
probability distribution P(é,t = @¢?/D). If h(x) =x, then we recover the result of Eq. (5).

To understand how the general ansatz in Eq. (12) works, we can specialize ourselves to
the entanglement entropy. As a consequence of Eq. (12), it is possible to formally write, in
the diffusive scaling limit, the time evolution of the n—Rényi entropy g) - and also of the
von Neumann entropy in the limit n + 1— as

SO) = [ Fmimelgn(O)).0 sn(8), (13)

where the symbol = is understood as an equality inside expectation values (-). The factor
Sn(k) is the contribution of the mode k to the n-Rényi entropy, which is the same as in the
non-random case. Since €; is distributed according to P(€,t), which is independent of k, the

dependence on k is completely washed away in (|£;(t)|). Using this property, we immediately
obtain

This result is exactly equivalent to Eq. (7), obtained ab initio in Ref. [28] through the sta-
tionary phase approximation.

Let us now show how Eq. (13) can also predict the time evolution of higher moments

where in the second line the average (-)9 is calculated with respect to the probability dis-
tribution of the normally distributed complex variable We. We were not able to compute
analytically this expectation value. However, we can numerically estimate it by sampling
over Wo and averaging the result of many realizations. We then compare this result with the
variance obtained by sampling from the exact evolution of the correlation matrix G under
Eq. (2), as explained in Appendix A. In Fig. 2, we show this comparison in a quench from
the Néel state, for which s(k) = log2 for all k. We observe that Eq. (15), derived from the
diffusive quasiparticle picture, correctly reproduces the time evolution of the variance of the
entanglement entropy.

Using the same procedure, it is straightforward to construct the m-th moment of S'4(t)
in terms of the m-point function of min(2|&;|,2), which counts the number of quasiparticles
shared between A and B. As a consequence, this picture should also apply to determining
the full probability distribution Pe(S4) of the entanglement entropy. This distribution can

Pe(S4). In Fig. 3, we compare this prediction with the statistics of entanglement obtained
from the exact time-evolved correlation matrix for different noise realizations, finding an excel-
lent agreement. In both Figs. 2 and 3, we can see that the entanglement fluctuations rapidly
grow at early times and then they slowly decay as 1/ VO. Observe that in the transition
between these two regimes, i.e. around © ~ 0.1, the distribution probability Po(S4) presents
a non-analiticity due to the quasiparticle counting function min(2|&;|, @).

3.1 Some checks via the stationary phase approximation

Here we provide arguments supporting the non-trivial ansatz proposed in Eq. (12) by leverag-
ing the standard tool of the stationary phase approximation, which allows for ab initio calcu-
lations [70]. Specifically, we first consider (Tr[G%]?) and then the generic product (Tr[G?]™).
We show that these quantities can be computed using the stationary phase approximation
and that the structure expected from the diffusive quasiparticle picture in Eq. (12) naturally
emerges in these examples.
For simplicity, we take as initial configuration the Néel state. In this case, we have
f(k) = 9(k) =1 in Eq. (4). Specializing Eq. (5) to F(G4) = Tr(G%), our conjecture reads as

MO), = 5 f Satta), (18)

and, applying Eq. (12), we expect

cmicxeymicx@y) = (4) (1420+ [BX rar), 09

where x¢, is defined as

rg, = max(1 — 2/g.(©)|/é, 0). (20)

Notice that ag, is the number of pairs of quasiparticles at relative distance 2|€;|, which are
fully contained in A.

Let us see how this result can be also derived from the stationary phase approximation.
We begin by rewriting (Tr[G3]?) using the decomposition in momentum space (3) of G4 and

the identity

where we have defined wi; = w(ki—k;). As shown in Ref. [28], the dynamics of the expectation
value of the product of two-point functions in momentum space is governed by

4 4
d (I Cr5.45 ) = e({kj, a}) (I Grej.4) (9) dt. (23)
j=l jal

The energy e({kj,qj}) is zero if qj = kj for any 7. This choice of momenta corresponds
precisely to the stationary state value of the correlator. For other choices of the momenta,
the energy e({kj,qj}) is generally negative, implying an exponential decay in time of the
expectation value in Eq. (23). We will be interested in the leading contribution to Eq. (22),
apart from the stationary state value, in the scaling limit ¢,t > oo. Following Ref. [28], we
observe that the leading term in the scaling limit is obtained from correlators with paired
momenta. We define two momenta kj; and kj as being paired if qj = +k; and qj = Fkj’,
and we will refer to this pairing using the notation (j 7’). The energy corresponding to p > 1
paired momenta is given by

ep({kj}) =-8D [p+ > cos(ky — kj) } . (24)
paired j,j’

In the case of expectation values of the form (Tr[F(Ga)]) studied in Ref. [28], the leading
contribution corresponds to having an even number of paired momenta with all the remaining
unpaired momenta satisfying q; = kj. However, when considering more complex expectation
values such as in Eq. (22), the presence of multiple traces imposes further constraints on the
pairings that give the leading contribution.

Let us analyze all the possible pairings in Eq. (22). We begin with no pairings, ie. qj = kj
or any j. In this case, ¢9 = 0 and the terms coming from the two traces in Eq. (22) completely
decouple. Their contribution is thus equal to the stationary value of (Tr[G?,]) squared, which
is Co = (€/4)?. In the case of a single pairing (j j’), whose contribution is denoted by Cu 5")
here are two possibilities: either both 7 and j’ are indices associated with the same trace,
such as (12) and (34), or j and j’ come from a different trace, for instance (13) and (24).
In the first scenario, due to the form of Eq. (23), the two traces completely decouple again
eaving us with the computation of the product of (Tr[G%]) for zero pairing and of (Tr[G%]) for
one pairing. The case of zero pairing has just been discussed above while the computation for
one pairing was done in Ref. [28]; the final result is C(y 2) = Cig.) = (/4)?(we). In the second
scenario, we can consider the pairing (13) (other combinations of the same type, i.e., with
indices j and j’ in different traces give the same result). Its contribution to the expectation
value in Eq. (22) is

where we have used Eqs. (23) and (24) as well as the specific form (4) of the two-point
correlation matrix at t = 0 for the Néel state. Because of the cyclicity of the momenta kj
in the exponent in Eq. (25), the terms e*?*€2(a)/2 cannot simply be eliminated by redefining
the k;’s. For this reason, if one performs the change of coordinates ¢, = € — €1, @2 = €2
and ¢3 = &4 — &3, C4 = &4, the variables C2 and ¢, remain in the integrand as etinllacay/?.
Each integral in (2, 4 gives then an extra O(¢~') factor, which is subleading. Therefore, the
contribution of pairings (j 7’) where j and j’ correspond to independent traces is subleading
and it can be neglected in the diffusive scaling limit. The last term we must consider comes
from having two pairings, each corresponding to one of the two traces, i.e. (12)(34). Applying
Eqs. (23) and (24), we find that its contribution is of the form

The z-shifts in the exponent can, this time, be removed by redefining ky(3) + 7 +> ky3). In
terms of the relative coordinates ¢;, Eq. (26) takes the form

Since the phase in the integrand of Eq. (27) rapidly oscillates when £ — oo, we can obtain its

for C2 and ¢4 in the limit @,t — oo implies that we can expand the integrand around ko ~ ky,

The gray symbols joined by a line correspond to the predictions (12) of the diffusive

Eq. (12) are estimated by numerical sampling. In both cases, the error bars are the
standard deviation of the mean over the samples considered.

One can employ the stationary approximation to compute (Tr[G%]™), as we have just done
for (Tr[G2J?). One obtains a sum of contributions given by all the possible ways of pairing
the quasimomenta k;. To obtain a nonzero contribution, again, paired momenta have to be in
the same trace. Therefore, even though the explicit computation of the leading contribution
for a generic pairing choice is rather complicated, by counting the multiplicity of pairings, one
obtains

(Tr[G3)") = (3) (: +mOQ, + (")) Cyto +m) (32)

where the first term corresponds to no pairings (qj = kj), and Cy is the contribution with p
pairings. We also know that

as explicitly computed for m = 2. It is clear that the expansion (32) has the same structure
as the binomial expansion of the ansatz in Eq. (31), in which each term can be identified with
the contribution C, of p-pairings. In Fig. 5, we numerically check the validity of Eq. (31) for
m = 2,3. The advantage of Eq. (31) is that it allows one to directly compute the contribution
C, from multiple pairings, without resorting to stationary phase techniques. In this way, one
can quickly derive the dynamics of more complex quantities, such as the higher moments of
the entanglement entropy, as discussed earlier, or the entanglement asymmetry as shown in
the next section.

To conclude, in Fig. 5, we provide additional numerical evidence of the validity of Eq. (12)

by comparing its prediction against the exact dynamics for an expectation value of the form

4 Dynamical symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba ef-
fect

The diffusive quasiparticle picture derived in the previous section allows us to give predictions
for the time evolution of the statistics of quite generic functions of G4. In this section, we
employ it to study the dynamics of the entanglement asymmetry. Our goal is to characterize,
at least in the vy = 1 QSSEP, the local dynamical restoration of a symmetry broken by the
initial state and the emergence of the quantum Mpemba effect.

The entanglement asymmetry quantifies the extent to which a symmetry transformation
generated by a charge Q,4 is broken within a subsystem A. In this work, we will restrict
ourselves to the U(1) group of transformations generated by the fermionic particle number.
Therefore, we focus on the entanglement asymmetry for an Abelian charge referring to, e.g.,
Refs. [71,72] for its generalization to non-Abelian transformation groups, and to Refs. [73,74]
for generalized symmetries. To define the entanglement asymmetry, it is necessary to introduce
the symmetrized reduced density matrix p4.q = >> a II,pallg, where I, is the projector onto
the eigenspace of Q,4 corresponding to the eigenvalue g. By construction, [p4,9,Qa] = 0
and, therefore, it is symmetric. The Rényi-n entanglement asymmetry is then defined as the
difference between the Rényi-n entropies of p4,g and pa [38],

AS = 5\(pa,q) — 8 (pa)- (34)

The main properties of As”) that make it a good quantifier of symmetry breaking in the
subsystem A are its positivity, As® > 0, and the fact that As”) = Oifand only if [p4, Qa] =
0. Asymmetry has been investigated in matrix product states [71,75], random states [72,76
78], and at [79-84] and away from [85-87] critical points in many-body quantum systems,
where it has been employed to study confinement, topological order, and stabilizerness [88-90].
It has also appeared under different names in resource theories [91,92] and quantum field
theories [93, 94].

A particularly convenient way of writing the symmetrized reduced density matrix p,q is
obtained by using the integral representation of the projector Hy,

Ae ;
PAQ = Sects pge 0a, (35)

Plugging this representation of p4.g in Eq. (34), it can be easily shown that the entanglement
asymmetry can be rewritten as

AS® = log | oe | (36)

where @ = (Q1,°+- ,Q@n_1) and Z,(a@) are known as charged moments of pa,
Zn(a) = Tr[psei@a a pae lartetan-)@aq, (37)

In the following, we restrict ourselves to n = 2 for practical reasons, although we expect the
same qualitative behavior for any n, including in the limit n + 1. In our case, the charge
Qa of interest is the fermion number Q4 = >> jeA cheap, which is quadratic in the fermionic
operators.

Our out-of-equilibrium protocol is the following: we prepare the system in an initial state
|wo) that breaks the U(1) symmetry associated with particle number conservation; therefore,
the entanglement asymmetry (34) is initially non-zero. We then evolve such a state with the
v = 1 QSSEP dynamics (1) and calculate the average asymmetry (AS.4(t)). We consider

13
initial Gaussian states, since all the information about their time evolution is then fully con-
tained in the two-point correlation functions Chm and Frm, as we discussed in Sec. 2. Notice
that, unlike in Sec. 3 where we considered initial symmetric states, here both Cum, Fam 4 0
due to the breaking of particle number symmetry at t = 0. In particular, we can choose as
initial states generic squeezed states,

with M,, an arbitrary real and odd function of k. As shown in Ref. [42], the charged moments

of (38) are
Za(a) = Za(dex (~¢ [ FE hi(a)). (39)
where the contribution per mode f(a),
f(a) = —log(1 — ng + npe”"?), (40)

is determined by the density of occupied modes ng = (wo| chee lo) = M2/(1+ M2). The
entanglement asymmetry in these squeezed states follows directly from (39) and (36). For
large @, it behaves as

AS?) (t =0) = 508 (=f ane - n)) . (41)

Let us first study the averaged time evolution of the charged moments. It has been
shown that, in a quench from (38) in the non-random case, log Z2(a,t) admits a quasiparticle
expression of the form of Eq. (11). We can then apply for it the same recipe as for the Rényi
entanglement entropy in Sec. 3. Precisely, the quasiparticle prediction for the dynamics in
the v = 1 QSSEP is obtained by replacing the distance between the quasiparticles in a pair
by the random variable 2|&,|. We then have the formal expression

Z2(a, t)

By taking the noise average (-) and using the same logic as for the Rényi entanglement entropy,

we find (1 Aad) e (/ se fatk)) fe P(€,t) max(1 — 2\€|/¢,0). 43)

We observe that, as for the noise-averaged entanglement entropy (14), pairs with different
momenta are uncorrelated in Eq. (43), and the dynamics does not depend on the momentum.
The effect of noise-induced correlations between pairs with different momenta will instead

play a role in the dynamics of the entanglement asymmetry. In Fig. 6, we compare the
prediction (43) with exact numerical results. The numerical data converge to Eq. (43) as
the subsystem length @ increases, thereby confirming the validity of the diffusive quasiparticle
picture for the noise-averaged charged moments. In the figure, we take as symmetry-breaking
initial states the ground state of the Kitaev chain,

for different values of the parameters y and h. For y # 0, this Hamiltonian does not com-
mute with the total particle number operator Q and, therefore, the ground state breaks the
corresponding U(1) symmetry and is of the form (38). The evolution of the charge moments

We now analyze the time evolution of the entanglement asymmetry. First, by combining
the conjecture in Eq. (12) with Eqs. (36) and (42), we expect that the average Rényi-2
asymmetry is described in the diffusive scaling limit by

(as?)(0)) (toe / “a ex ( ef Fratea))|) (47)

Here the average is over different realizations of the random variable W; = Way +iW7,4, with
War), normally distributed variables with distribution P(€,t), from which one constructs &
and x¢, (cf. (10) and (20)). According to Eq. (47), only the quasiparticle pairs that are fully
contained in the subsystem A, see Fig. 1, contribute to (As? (@)). Since the probability
distribution P(€,t) that governs the separation &;(t) between the two quasiparticles of a
pair becomes wider with t, the probability of having entangled pairs fully contained in A
decreases with time, vanishing in the long time limit. As a consequence, Eq. (47) predicts

that (As?)e)) decreases in time and eventually tends to zero when © — oo. This means

entanglement asymmetry over 10° different noise realizations for increasing subsystem
sizes ¢ in the thermodynamic limit L — oo. The solid curves show the prediction of
the diffusive quasiparticle picture in Eq. (47), where the average has been estimated

that, in the stationary state, the particle number symmetry, which was initially broken, is on
average restored within subsystem A.

In Fig. 7, we compare the prediction of the quasiparticle picture in Eq. (47) with the exact
numerical data for the Rényi-2 asymmetry. The data are obtained by sampling over different
noise realizations, as explained in Appendix A. The initial states are the same used to discuss
the charged moments in Fig. 6; i.e. the ground state of the Kitaev chain (44) for two different
values of y and h. In the plots, we restrict ourselves to “small” © = 0.1, where the decay
of the average asymmetry to zero is not yet apparent. Indeed, due to the diffusive scaling
of the asymmetry, to observe the symmetry restoration we would need to consider t > @.
For this reason, beyond the times shown in the plot, the exact numerical calculation of the
ime-evolved correlation matrices becomes increasingly challenging. Nevertheless, we can see
hat, as the subsystem size @ increases, the numerical data converge to the values predicted
by Eq. (47).
Although Eq. (47) is hard to treat analytically due to the presence of the logarithm
inside the expectation value, we can extract from it the analytical long-time behavior of the
asymmetry and its dependence on the initial state. This analysis is crucial to understand the
ime scales of the symmetry restoration and the presence of the quantum Mpemba effect.

For convenience, we write the complex Brownian motion W; that enters in €;(t) in po-
ar coordinates, i.e. as W; = pe’®. The probability distribution of p at time t is P;(p) =
e~?'/(P)99/(Dt) while the phase ¢ is at each time distributed uniformly over [-7, 7) inde-
pendently on the stochastic variable p. The counting factor rg, can then be rewritten as
Lg, = max(1 — 4p|sin(k — k*)|/€,0), where k* = 1/2 — ¢ is also uniformily distributed. At
ong times, © > 1, realizations with xg, 4 0 are statistically suppressed due to the time
evolution of the probability distribution P;(p). For this reason, in that regime, we can expand

The asymptotic vanishing behavior of Eq. (48) is determined by the modes close to k* and

average), the sine in Eq. (48) can be expanded around k ~ k* and k ~ k* + 7, and we obtain

where the factor 2 takes into account the contribution of both k ~ k* and k ~ k*+7, which are
equal. It is important to remark that, to obtain (48) we performed an expansion in Eq. (47)
in which we neglected the contribution from realizations with small values of p. Therefore,
to make the result in Eq. (50) self-consistent when computing the expectation value, we need
to introduce a cutoff € on the smallest allowed value of p. For this reason, we compute the
expectation value (50) as follows

restoration of the symmetry in the stationary state. However, in the v-QSSEP model the
decay is ~ 1/ Vt due to the diffusive nature of the dynamics, whereas in the non-random
case it is 1/t or 1/t°, since the quasiparticles propagate ballistically. Moreover, the prefactor
Y (cf. (53)) that encodes the information of the initial state is given by g, (cf. (54)) in
both cases, but with a key difference. In the non-random case, this prefactor is, up to a
proportionality constant, the value of the function gz at the slowest mode. In the v-QSSEP,
instead, the prefactor is the average of gz equally weighted over all possible momenta. That is,
the restoration of symmetry at long times is governed by the slowest mode in the non-random
case, whereas all modes contribute when the hopping amplitudes are random. This difference
is crucial for the existence of the quantum Mpemba effect.

Indeed, the quantum Mpemba effect occurs when, for a pair of initial states, the symmetry
is restored faster in the dynamics from the state that initially breaks it more. Let us consider,
therefore, two initial states of the form in Eq. (38), denoted 1 and 2, that break the particle
number symmetry. Therefore, let us assume that at t = 0, AS4i(0) > AS'4,2(0), where
AS 41(2)(0) is the initial asymmetry in the state 1(2). Using the result in Eq. (41), this

condition can be rewritten in terms of the occupation functions of the two initial states nh?)

The quantity n;(1—n,)/(27) is also known as the charge susceptibility per mode [42]. The
quantum Mpemba effect occurs when there is a time after which AS41(t) < AS4(t) for all
t. According to Eq. (53), which describes the long time behavior of the average asymmetry,
this occurs when YT; < Y2. Using the explicit expression of Y in Eq. (53), we can also rewrite

this condition in terms of the occupation functions n(?) as follows

7) / oF max(log n log(1 = n)) < -f{ oF max(log n® log(1 = n)), (56)

18
Given two initial squeezed states with different asymmetry, Eqs. (55) and (56) are the nec-
essary and sufficient conditions for the existence of quantum Mpemba effect in the v = 1
QSSEP. Notice that they only depend on the density of occupied modes of the initial states.

We numerically investigated the conditions (55) and (56) for several initial states. We
observed that the presence of the momentum average in (56), in sharp contrast to the non-
random case in which the late-time behavior is determined by the slowest mode, inhibits
the Quantum Mpemba effect. In fact, we studied the conditions (55) and (56) for pairs of
ground states of (44) corresponding to different h and y and for which the Mpemba effect
occurs in the non-random case, finding that most of them violate condition (ii). Precisely,
our analysis suggests that Mpemba effect occurs only for initial states with nearly identical
asymmetries. This makes the quantum Mpemba effect in the v = 1 QSSEP a highly fine tuned
phenomenon. For instance, the Mpemba effect does not occur for the tilted ferromagnetic
states ¢ 8/2257 |t-+-), which are the ground state of the Hamiltonian (44) along the
curve h? +7? = 1 with cos? 9 = (1—)/(1+7). This is remarkable, as the quantum Mpemba
effect is typically observed for any pair of initial states within this family — not only in the
non-random analogue of the vy = 1 QSSEP [38], but also in random unitary circuits [56] and

a

in the experiment [66]. The asymmetry of these states is As? = 1/2log(¢/2sin? 6) and,
therefore, it increases monotonically with @ € [0,7/2]. On the other hand, we numerically
verified that, for these states, Y(0,) < Y(62) for any 0 < 6; < 6) < 7/2 and, therefore, the
condition (ii) for the occurence of the Mpemba effect is never satified.

5 Conclusions

In this work, we studied the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the statistics of entanglement in a
spatially homogeneous version of the Quantum Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process (QSSEP)
model, the vy = 1 QSSEP. We built upon the results of Ref. [28], in which it is shown that
the average entanglement growth is diffusive, and it can be described by the propagation of
entangled pairs of quasiparticles that perform a Brownian motion. We extended this picture
by taking into account the statistical correlations between the different pairs of quasiparticles.
This generalization allows us to exactly characterize the full-time dynamics of all the higher
moments and, therefore, the full distribution probability of the entanglement entropy.

The diffusive quasiparticle picture developed here can be applied to calculate the average
full-time dynamics of any sufficiently well-behaved function of the reduced density matrix of
a subsystem in the vy = 1 QSSEP model. In particular, we used it to analyze the dynamical
restoration of the symmetry associated with particle number conservation, and the emergence
of the quantum Mpemba effect. To this end, we derived the exact time evolution in the
diffusive scaling limit of the average entanglement asymmetry, which measures the degree
of symmetry breaking in a subsystem. In contrast to the analogous non-random model, we
showed that the stochasticity of the time evolution strongly inhibits the quantum Mpemba
effect. This result is in contrast with what has been observed in random unitary circuits [55,

56].

There are several interesting directions for future work. For instance, it would be interest-
ing to further investigate the role of stochastic dynamics in the Mpemba effect. An immediate
question is whether the dynamics of the generic v-QSSEP model, i.e. when spatial invari-
ance is only partially recovered, admits a similar diffusive quasiparticle picture. While in the
fully inhomogeneous limit v — oo, the entanglement generation mechanism is likely related
to the one discussed in Ref. [20], for a finite value v > 2, the mechanism is not understood
yet. For this reason, studying the model at finite v could provide further insight into the
crossover between those two extreme cases. Another possibility consists of generalizing the
v—QSSEP model to include interactions. In generic interacting models, the linear growth

19
of entanglement is expected to be restored [17, 18,95]; however, a stochastic continuous-time
Hamiltonian dynamics in which the generator is an interacting integrable model could instead
retain a diffusive entanglement spreading. Developing a diffusive analogue of the quasiparticle
picture for interacting integrable systems [36] is an interesting direction.

A Numerical techniques

In this Appendix, we outline the methods used to compute the time evolution of the correlation
matrices under Eq. (2) for different noise realizations, which serve to validate the results
presented in the main text. Let us discuss separately the case of initial states that have
particle-number symmetry but break translational invariance, studied in Sec. 3, from those
that are translationally invariant but break particle-number symmetry, considered in Sec. 4.

dWr, and dW,, are real and normally distributed with zero mean and variance Ddt/2, taking
dt = 0.05. We verified that the result of the computation does not significantly change when
decreasing dt. From the restriction G'4 of the correlation matrix (58) to A, the entanglement
entropy can be calculated using the formula [69]

S4 = —Tr [Ga log G4 + (I— Ga) log(I — Ga)]. (59)

Quench dynamics from a symmetry breaking initial state: In this case, we can
apply the same strategy as before, but now the correlations F,, are not zero in the initial
state. Therefore, it is more natural to arrange all the two-point correlations in the single

matrix
Gc F,
“ ( Frm Onm — Gin ) mm ( )

Since both the initial state and the time evolution are translationally invariant, we can write
Tas

— fo inn
fan

Pnm(t) —™C(k, t), (61)

20
where C(k,t) is a 2 x 2 matrix. In particular, when the initial state is the ground state of the
Kitaev chain (44), it reads

_ cos Ay ie 2k) gin A;
C(k,t) = (seat sin A, —cos Ax, , (62)
with i k
cos Ap = p= 60s 7 (63)
V(h—cosk)? + 7 sin? k
sin Ay ae (64)

V(h—cosk)? + 72 sin2 kh
The random variable ¢;(t) is generated as in the case of symmetric states, and we take again
dt = 0.05. The charged moments Z,,(a@), defined in Eq. (37), can be calculated from the
restriction [4 of [ to A with the formula [38]

1/2

I-T n n
Zn(a) = | det ( 5 ‘) 1+] W; . (65)
j=l

where Wj = (I+T4)(I- T4)-te*"4 and an = — eS, aj. The matrix n, is a diagonal
2¢ x 2¢ matrix with entries (n4)2j~-1,2;-1 = —1 and (na)2j2; = 1, 7 = 1,...,@. Once the
charged moments are determined numerically, the entanglement asymmetry can be calculated
applying Eq. (36).
