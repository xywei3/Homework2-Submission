This study investigates the emergence of quantum spin liquid phases in pyrochlore oxides with non-
Kramers ions, driven by structural randomness that effectively acts as a transverse field, introducing
quantum fluctuations on top of the spin ice manifold. This is contrary to the naive expectation
that disorder favors phases with short-range entanglement by adjusting the spins with their local
environment. Given this unusual situation, it is essential to assess the stability of the spin-liquid
phase with respect to the disorder. To perform this study, a minimal model for disordered quantum
spin ice, the transverse-field Ising model, is analyzed using a formulation of gauge mean-field theory
(GMFT) directly in real space. This approach allows the inclusion of disorder effects exactly and
provides access to non-perturbative effects. The analysis shows that the quantum spin ice remains
remarkably stable with respect to disorder up to the transition to the polarized phase at high fields,
indicating that it can occur in real materials. Moreover, the Griffiths region of enhanced disorder-
induced fluctuations appears tiny and restricted to the immediate vicinity of this transition due to the

uniqueness of the low-energy excitations of the prob
description of the disorder captures the physical be’

em. For most of the phase diagram, an average
havior well, indicating that the inhomogeneous

quantum spin ice behaves closely to its homogeneous counterpart.

I. INTRODUCTION

Rare-earth pyrochlores are among the most compelling
families of frustrated magnets. Their structure — a lattice
of corner-sharing tetrahedra — combined with complex
rystal-field effects on the rare-earth ions [1], gives rise to
a plethora of novel quantum states [2, 3], particularly in
materials exhibiting magnetic easy-axis anisotropy, as in
ne spin-ice compounds [4, 5]. In these materials, there
is no long-range magnetic order, and the “two-in-two-
out” rule on each tethrahedron governs its disordered
ground state. This local constraint is elegantly described
oy an emergent gauge field analogous to Gauss’ law, with
its magnetic correlations revealing characteristic “pinch
oint” singularities, as captured by neutron scattering
experiments [6-10]. In the presence of quantum fluctua-
ions, this classical state is promoted to a Quantum Spin
ce (QSI), where the low-energy dynamics are governed
y compact quantum electrodynamics, whose excitations
include a gapless emergent photon, alongside massive vi-
sons and spinon excitations [11-16].
While it is not straightforward to encounter spin-ice
materials with appreciable quantum fluctuation, Ref.
17| proposed an ingenious way to stabilize a QSI via
randomness in non-Kramers doublet rare-earth ions, in-
cluding the promising QSI candidates Pr2Zr2O7, [18-20]
and Pr2Sn2O;, [21]. In these systems, the doublet degen-
eracy is protected by the D3q point group symmetry, and
it can be described by a pseudospin 1/2 operator S;. Its
component $7 is time reversal odd, while the transverse
components S# are symmetric under time reversal. The
breaking of the D3q symmetry by quenched disorder di-
rectly acts as a local transverse field coupling linearly to

he transverse components of the pseudospin, introduc-
ing quantum fluctuations in the problem, and paving the
way to stabilize the QSI state either by chemical doping
or by applying strain [17, 22-24]. Nonetheless, it is es-
sential to check the stability of the QSI state with respect
o the disorder itself, as it might also act to destabilize
the phase, as it is observed in analogous situations of
order by structural disorder [25-30].

In ordered magnets, the effects of disorder vary greatly.
In unfrustrated systems, the ordered state is usually sta-
ble in the presence of defects, with disorder provoking
mild modifications in the value of the order parameter
and a broadening of the excitations [31, 32]. The excep-
tion is the vicinity of a quantum critical point, where
one might observe a Griffiths phase, characterized by
a substantial enhancement of disorder fluctuations [33-
36]. For frustrated systems, disorder can stabilize phases
without long-range order and with short-range entangle-
ment, such as spin glasses or random singlets [37-45].

In this work, we study a disordered transverse-field
Ising model on the pyrochlore lattice as a minimal model
for hosting the QSI. We include the effects of disorder
as a random field and solve the model using a real-space
implementation of the gauge mean-field theory (GMFT)
[46, 47] on finite clusters. We find that the QSI is ro-
bust and that an average description of the disorder is
sufficient to describe most of the QSI phase accurately.
Overall, the effects of disorder are milder than naively
suggested by previous studies of the transverse-field Ising
model without frustration [48]. In particular, a putative
Griffiths phase exists only in the immediate vicinity of
the transition between the QSI and the paramagnetic
phase. We link this observation to the peculiar form of
the spinon wavefunction in this problem

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we
present the model and discuss its solution using GMFT
directly in real space. In Sec. III we present the solution

of the model in finite clusters and construct its phase
diagram using the average value of the spinon gap and
its relative fluctuations as estimators for phase bound-
aries. Sec. IV discusses properties of the spinon wave-
function and its uncanny localization properties obtained
from the level spacing analyses. The effects of further ex-
change terms and finite size effects are discussed in Sec.
V, whereas Sec. VI concludes the paper with a discussion
of our results.

II. MODEL AND MEAN-FIELD THEORY

As a minimal model for the QSI, we start with the
nearest-neighbor spin-ice Hamiltonian supplemented by
a transverse field.

=J)_ 8757 - » hiS? (1)

(9)

where J denotes the nearest neighbor exchange coupling
between sites i and j in the pyrochlore lattice and h;
is the random transverse field. The effects of further
exchange terms will be discussed in Sec. V. The pseu-
dospins are written in the local reference frame of the
pyrochlore lattice [3, 12]. For h; = 0, this model captures
the spin-ice phase. In large fields, we observe a polarized
phase with the spin pointing along the local field direc-
tion. Previous investigations focused on the particular
case of uniform fields, h; = h. They showed that a QSI
is stable for an infinitesimal h and there is a discontinu-
ous transition between the QSI and the polarized phase
at a critical field h, [17, 22, 24].

The pyrochlore lattice is composed of corner-sharing
“up” and “down” tetrahedra [1]. For an arbitrary tetra-
hedron t, we define the “two-in-two-out” rule, or the spin
ice rule, through the charge operator

Q =m>_ 5, (2)

wet

with 7, = +1 for up/down tetrahedron. In the absence of
a transverse field, this charge operator vanishes on every
etrahedron at zero temperature. For a non-zero trans-
verse field, spin flip processes are allowed, which violate
he spin ice rule. In particular, when the site-dependent
random transverse fields are comparable to the nearest-
neighbor coupling, h;/J ~ 1, we need to resort to non-
erturbative methods to solve the problem.

In this work, we employ the parton representation in-
roduced in Ref. [46]:

St = dist ®,, (3)

aS ab

zz
Si = San,

where 7 is the pyrochlore site shared by the two tetra-
hedra a and 6, up and down, respectively. The ran-
dom transverse field becomes h; = hay. We define the

“.

yosonic operators ®, (61) on the centers of the “up”

and “down” tetrahedra of the pyrochlore lattice. These
operators dress the transverse components of the auxil
iary spins and annihilate/create bosonic spinons, which
emerge as fractionalized excitations corresponding to lo-
cal violations of the ice rules, Qa # 0. In this represen-
tation, the sites of the original pyrochlore lattice become
bonds of the dual diamond lattice. Such operators sat-
isfy the following commutation rules: [®.,Qo| = ®adas
and [®1, Q,] = —®i5qy. It is convenient to introduce the
real and compact rotor variable ya, which is canonically
conjugated to the charge operator [~a,Qs] = iday. With
the help of this rotor variable, we can write ®, = e~*?«
and 616, = 1. Using the parton representation, Eq. (3),
in the spin Hamiltonian, Eq. (1), we obtain

H=5 7 5 hao (#},

Eq. 4 is ammenable to the application of the GMFT:
ish — GO (s) + (B'S) s— (16) (s). Then, the Hamil-
tonian decouples into a gauge contribution analogous to a
Zeeman Hamiltonian with a random field and a quadratic
spinon-hopping Hamiltonian. Contrary to the spinon
Hamiltonian, which couples neighboring tethraedra, the
former Hamiltonian consists of a set of decoupled bonds,
which is trivially soluble, and we thus do not consider it.
Following prescription of Ref. [46], we set (s ea) = 1/2
and impose the on-site constraint i 1 ®, = 1 only on aver-
age (b1@,) = 1. The mean-field H amiltonian now readé

The site-dependent Lagrange multiplier A, plays the role
of a mass for ®,, and it implements the average con-
straint in the Hamiltonian. The random transverse field
breaks the translation invariance, so we are forced to im-
plement this Hamiltonian in real space. Using the result
from Ref. [46], we promote the spinon field to a complex
quantum rotor with the squared charge operator being
defined as Q? > Ilia, Ia = p? + ip’, and represent the
spinon operator as position variables ®, = %q + iya. A
straightforward substitution of the coordinates and mo-
menta variables into the quantum spin ice Hamiltonian
maps this problem onto a quantum harmonic oscillator

with the matrix M being defined as May = 2Aadab —

where Uan = (a|n) corresponds to the a-th entry of the
n-th eigenvector of the matrix M. The eigenvalues of MZ

values of the mass matrix M.

The real-space implementation of the GMFT is per-
formed in finite clusters of the diamond lattice with lin-
ear size L, with N = 2L3 sites, under periodic bound-
ary conditions. The self-consistent mean-field equations
(®1®,) = 1 are solved iteratively, ensuring that the local
constraint is satisfied at every site on average. We ini-
tialize the computation with a homogeneous Lagrange

a tolerance value, | (@1,) — 1] < 10-%. The parameter
y sets the learning rate of the method. For transverse
fields away from the quantum critical point, y = 107! is
sufficient to ensure convergence of the mean-field equa-
tions. As we approach criticality, the energy landscape
becomes increasingly flat. Typically, y = 107? is suffi-
cient to track the shallow gradient during updates.

whose mean and standard deviation are yu(h;) = h and
a(h;) = 6h. We tested different disorder distributions,
e.g., uniform disorder and site dilution, and the results
are qualitatively the same. Within the GMFT, the tran-
sition between the QSI and the polarized phase is con-
inuous and characterized by the closing of the spinon
gap (46, 47], at odds with the discontinuous transition
‘ound beyond mean-field in the clean limit [17, 22, 24].
On general grounds, we expect that such a discontinuous
uniform transition is unstable in three dimensions above
a critical value of disorder due to the Imry-Ma criterion
36, 49]. Assuming the transition persists beyond this
point, it will be continuous, and we expect the qualita-
ive picture captured by GMF'T to be valid for moderate
o strong disorder.

throughout the lattice. As long as the spinon gap is fi-
nite, the QSI is stable. From our numerics, we extract
the spinon gap as the smallest eigenvalue of the mean-
field Hamiltonian in Eq. (5), which we dub wo. From
the mean-field solutions in Eqs. (7), we obtain the value
of the Lagrange multiplier \; at each site i of the dia-
mond lattice. As h increases, the average value X also
increases. We observe that the critical point occurs at
X = hea, with the effective random transverse field being
defined as the sum of the fields over the sites of a given
tetrahedron, hee = 1/435, has, Fig. 2. In Tab. I we list
the value of the critical field as a function of dh.

We can understand this relation in the limit 6h > 0.
We focus on the spinon wavefunction, i.e. the wavefunc-
tion corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue of the matrix

transition wo > 0 and we obtain »; MijUjo © 0. For a
delocalized wavefunction, we can write Ujy ~ 1/VN and
Yj Mi; = 0. This equation implies A; = Dey hij /4 = hig.
Averaging over all sites, we obtain 1 = heg. To justify
the validity of this equality for finite disorder, we only
require that Ujo ~ z; around site i, with i and j nearest-
neighbors and z; the value of the wavefunction in the
vicinity of site 7, which we take as roughly constant. In
this fashion, our argument is also extended to localized
wavefunctions.

As previously mentioned, the transition to the polar-

ized state in each sample can also be captured by the
point at which wo — 0. Thus, an alternative definition of
h, is the point where the average value of the spinon gap,
@o, vanishes, Fig. 3(a). In the clean case, wo ~ (he — hn)’,
with 8 = 1/2. As we increase the disorder, the value of
he exponent £ increases, but the spinon gap still van-
ishes for a finite value of the field. The values of h, ob-
ained within this procedure naturally coincide with the
estimate from Fig. 2.
Because for each realization of disorder we obtain a
value of wo, we actually construct its distribution P (wo),
Figs. 3(c)-(d). This quantity evolves smoothly towards
he quantum critical point, and broadens with increas-
ing disorder strength. Since wo is a positive quantity,
its distribution skews as we progressively approach the
quantum critical point, but we observe no appreciable
enhancement of P (wo ¥ 0), leading to a smooth behav-
ior of P (wo), even close to he.

Close to a quantum critical point in an inhomogeneous
system, one would expect a Griffiths phase, a region ex-
hibiting an enhancement of the effective disorder, which
translates into power-law distributions of the local gaps
[36, 50-54], with important thermodynamic and spec-
troscopy signatures. The physics of the Griffiths phase is

usually tied to the existence of rare regions, which are do-
mains where the disorder is significantly different from its
average bulk value. Because our system sizes are modest,
it is difficult to resolve this physics, even for a significant
bare disorder dh. To estimate the extent of a Griffiths-
like region, we then compute the relative fluctuation of
P (wo) as shown in Figs. 3(b). We set the maximum
value of this quantity to the point at which the effec-

tive disorder is enhanced

smaller effective disorder in this

particular realization. We see that the onset of this re-
gion of enhanced fluctuations is very close to h,, and thus
we have a limited window in which disorder fluctuations
play a non-trivial role.

Collecting all this information from the spinon gap,
we construct the phase diagram in Fig. 1. The phase
boundary is weakly dependent on 6h. For small 5h, our
results are consistent with the perturbative estimation
of h. from Ref. [23]. The window of a putative Grif-
fiths phase is also tiny, and its curvature follows that of
h,. Both results indicate a weak dependence on disorder
fluctuations, suggesting that an average description of
the disorder is sufficient for a qualitative understanding.
In the next section, we will link this surprising finding to

the peculiar nature of the spinon excitations.

IV. SPINON LOCALIZATION

Within the GMFT, the spin ice ground state for zero
field corresponds to a flat band of spinons, as there is
no effective hopping between different tetrahedra for the
charge Q,. The spinons are then localized at each site o
he diamond lattice. For a finite field, hopping is pos-
sible, and the spinons can now propagate throughou
he lattice. Therefore, we have a system in which dis-
order initially leads to the delocalization of excitations
55, 56]. As disorder increases, we expect a reversal o
this trend as Anderson localization sets in [57]. More
importantly, close to the critical field, previous stud-
ies show that low-energy excitations become localized
32, 52, 53, 58]. Therefore, we expect a competing trend
of disorder effects. On one hand, it delocalizes the spinon
and stabilizes the QSI phase. On the other hand, as we
approach the transition, we expect a localization of the
low-energy excitations.

Because our system sizes are modest, we character-
ize the localization properties of the excitations via the
spectral statistics, computing the consecutive gap ratio
between adjacent energy levels [59]

T_ = min (=.=) , (11)

on

where Sp, = Wn4+1 — Wn. Here, w, are the energy levels
of the effective Hamiltonian in Eq. 5. In the localized
regime, the statistical distribution of r follows the Pois-
son distribution and reads Ppo(r) = 2/(1+17)?, with its
mean value being Tp. © 0.39. In the delocalized regime,
the system exhibits strong level repulsion. For a time-
reversal invariant system, such as the random transverse
field quantum spin ice, this leads to Wigner-Dyson distri-
bution within the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE)
class [60], Po(r) = (27/4)(r + r?)/(L +r +1r?)5/?, and
its mean value is To ¥ 0.54.

In Fig. 4, we display the spectral statistics obtained by
analyzing the energy level spacings among the first five
energy levels for 6h/J = 0.7. In Fig. 4(a), the disorder is
strong enough to break the spectrum degeneracy near the
classical spin ice manifold, and the system closely repro-
duces the GOE statistics already for h/h. = 0.15. This
phenomenon is analogous to inverse Anderson localiza-
tion observed in flat band systems [55, 56]. In Fig. 4(b),
as we approach criticality, P(r) highlights a more local-
ized nature of the spinon wavefunction as it moves from
GOE to Poisson statistics. In Fig. 4 (c), this trend is
enhanced as we are very close to criticality. The odd be-
havior at small r happens because the energy level corre-
sponding to the spinon gap becomes well separated from
the next level for h + he.

All these trends are summarized in Fig. 4(d), where we
show the average value of the level spacing 7 as a func-
tion of both dh and h. For small values of h and oh, the
spinon is localized as we are close to the classical spin ice
manifold. This implies 7 ~ 0.39, consistent with a Pois-
son distribution. If we fix h < 0.5 and increase dh, the
wavefunction becomes delocalized as F + 0.54, consistent
with the GOE limit. Disorder thus effectively delocalizes
the spinon and stabilizes the QSI by pushing the system
away from the flat-band limit. If we now fix dh and vary
the average field strength, the spinon again delocalizes,
but this time without reaching the GOE limit in general.
As we approach the critical point, the spinons become
localized again due to the enhanced effective disorder.

This dual nature of disorder makes the inhomogeneous
QSI a peculiar problem. In a usual random system,
the effective disorder increases close to the critical point,
leading to the localization of the low-energy excitations
and the emergence of a Griffiths phase [32, 52, 53, 58].
In finite-system simulations, this effect is amplified as
the bare disorder increases. In the present system, the
situation is distinct. As we increase dh, the spinon be-
comes more delocalized, thus fighting against the occur-
rence of a Griffiths phase. On general grounds, one still
expects a Griffiths phase to appear near h, [17]. How-
ever, a detailed characterization requires studies of much
larger system sizes, as our current results suggest that
this phase would be restricted to the immediate vicinity
of the critical point.

V. EXTENSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF THE
APPROACH

Besides the random field, disorder can also stabi-
ize additional exchange couplings in non-Kramers py-
rochlores, coupling the transverse pseudo-spin compo-
nents [2, 3, 61]. It is then important to test the
generality of our findings against further terms in Eq.
. As a minimal modification, we include the term
Jt (SiS; +S, St), changing it to an XXZ model in a
field, which might be relevant for Pr-based compounds.
For simplicity, we consider only the average value of the
coupling J;. In the GMFT language, this term translates
into a next-to-nearest neighbors hopping in the diamond

(12)

Because J+ adds a hopping term to the problem, a naive
guess would be that it favors the spinon delocalization.
However, its key effect is to bring the system closer to
criticality, effectively renormalizing h, in a manner simi-
ar to the clean case [46]. Fig. 5(a)-(b), shows this trend
in P(r). For fixed values of the field and the disorder J+
changes P(r) from GOE to Poisson, similar to the trend
displayed in Fig. 4 as we increase h for fixed 5h. The

spinon energy wo in Fig. 5(d) shows not only the reduc-
tion of the average value of the gap, but also a decrease
in the width of P (wo), signaling that it also reduces the
effective disorder in the problem, even though wo dimin-
ishes. Overall, extra exchange terms chiefly renormalize
the energy scales without altering the qualitative picture
emerging from Eq. 1 within GMFT.

As a final check of our results, we investigate finite-size
effects. The system sizes we can access with the current
implementation of the real-space GFMT, based on ex-
act diagonalization of Eq. 5, are modest, and we only
consider L < 10. As shown in Fig. 6, finite-size scaling
follows the general expectations. For the distributions
P (wo) in Fig. 6 (a), we observe an increase in the av-
erage spinon energy with L, accompanied by a decrease
in the width of the distribution. This effect is expected:
by increasing the gap, we effectively move away from the
critical point and thus reduce the disorder fluctuations in
the system. The rate of change of P (wo) also decreases
with L, suggesting the convergence of the results. In
Fig. 6 (b), we display the average consecutive gap ratio
for dh/J = 0.7 as a function of h. As the system size in-
creases, the spinon wavefunction delocalization becomes
more apparent, but no qualitative change is observed.
We thus conclude that our key observations are robust
with respect to finite-size effects within the range of L
we can access.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we investigated the ground state of inho-
mogeneous non-Kramers pyrochlores motivated by the
suggestion of Ref. [17] that a quantum spin ice phase is
stabilized by disorder. As a minimal model, we then con-
sidered a transverse-field Ising model with random fields.
For small fields, this system is in the quantum spin ice
phase, whereas for large fields it is in the polarized phase.
To include the effects of disorder exactly, we implemented
a real-space version of the gauge mean-field theory and
solved the problem for finite systems. Using the aver-
age spinon gap Wo as an order parameter, we mapped
the boundary between the quantum spin liquid and the
polarized phases in the (h, 5h) parameter space, where h
is the average value of the field and 6h its fluctuations.
We considered the relative fluctuations of wo as an esti-
mator of the effective disorder in the system. We found
that enhanced disorder fluctuations are restricted to the
immediate vicinity of the critical point. The full distribu-
tion P (wo) is smooth for all parameters we study, show-
ing no signs of an accumulation of low-energy excitations
in the system. Taken together, all these observations
indicate that the disorder primarily renormalizes the en-
ergy scales rather than inducing strong inhomogeneous
physics in the system.

In general, we expect a Griffiths phase to emerge near
the critical point in the current problem. The limited
influence of disorder fluctuations implies that the extent
of the Griffiths phase in this problem is parametrically
small, as suggested in our phase diagram. Usually, a
Griffiths phase is linked to the existence of rare regions
where the local energy gap is, for instance, smaller than
the average. In our language, we would find puddles
of almost polarized regions within the spin liquid phase.
Therefore, the spinon wavefunction — the ground state
of our system — would be essentially zero in these re-
gions, implying it would be essentially localized in the
regions favoring the spin liquid phase [32, 52, 53, 58].
We then conclude that this wavefunction is localized both
for h > 0 and for h > h,. We confirm this trend nu-
merically, investigating the degree of the localization of
the spinon wavefunction using the spinon gap statistics
P(r). Such a finding makes this problem special because
we start with localized spinons (they are dispersionless
in the spin ice phase), delocalize them by adding disor-
der, and ultimately localize them again as disorder in-
creases and we reach the critical field. We believe that
this dual nature of disorder in the problem is responsi-
ble for shrinking the Griffiths phase. We checked that
our conclusions are robust with respect to additional ex-
change terms and finite-size effects.

Our simple scenario suggests that the results for the
clean case, or weak disorder [17, 22-24], are probably
sufficient to describe the quantum spin-ice phase quali-
tatively. We expect the dominant signal in neutron scat-
tering experiments to be from the emerging photons [62—
65], because the transverse pseudospin components in
this model, S*, transform as quadrupoles, they do not
couple to neutron spins. Apart from appearing in spec-
troscopic probes, the photons also give a T term to the
specific heat. Because collective excitations are usually

netic pyrochlore oxides, Rev. Mod. Phys. 82, 53 (2010).

localized in disordered systems [66], apart from the im-
mediate vicinity of a quantum critical point, one expects
chis contribution to be observed inside all the quantum
pin ice phases.

Our work also raises several questions that require fur-
cher study. Because the Griffiths phase exists on both
sides of the transition, it would be interesting to study
s extent within the polarized phase using, for instance,
spin-wave theory in real space [31, 58]. The gauge mean-
field theory we employ predicts a continuous transition
between the quantum spin ice and the polarized phase.
Treatments including fluctuations beyond mean-field pre-
ict a discontinuous transition [17, 22, 24]. Thus, includ-
ing fluctuations on top of the mean-field solution would
be an interesting exercise not only to investigate its effect
on the order of the transition, but also to confirm that a
continuous transition is stable if disorder exceeds a criti-
cal value. It would also be useful to investigate the stabil-
ity of competing ground states in the presence of disorder
— for instance, a random singlet phase [39, 45, 67] or a
spin-glass [42, 43, 68] — especially for large values of
disorder where the local constraints might dominate the
physics.
