Abstract

The spin Seebeck effect is useful for probing the spin correlations and magnetic order in magnetic
insulators. Here, we report a strong longitudinal spin Seebeck effect (LSSE) in antiferromagnetic
V203 thin films. The LSSE response at cryogenic temperatures increases as a function of the
external magnetic field until it approaches saturation. The response at given power and field
exhibits a non-monotonic temperature dependence, with a pronounced peak that shifts toward
higher temperatures as the field increases. Furthermore, the magnitude of the LSSE signal
decreases consistently with increasing thickness, implying that the bulk SSE dominates any
interfacial contribution. This negative correlation between the SSE and the thickness implies that
the magnon energy relaxation length in V203 is shorter than the thickness of our thinnest film,
50 nm, consistent with the strong spin-lattice coupling in this material.

The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) [1-4] generates spin current between a magnetic insulator (MI)
and a nonmagnetic metal under heat, and it has proven to be a powerful tool to study spin
correlations and magnetic order in insulators [4]. Extensive investigations have explored the SSE
across diverse magnetic systems— including  ferrimagnets [5-8], ferromagnets [9],
antiferromagnets [10-23], quantum spin systems [24-28], and paramagnets [20, 29, 30]. Among
these, antiferromagnetic insulators (AFIs) are of great interest because they have no net
magnetization to couple with external fields and show terahertz frequency magnetization dynamics,
making them promising materials for spintronic applications [31]. However, SSE in AFIs is
comparatively less understood due to the presence of multiple magnon branches, spin-flop

transitions, and complex responses [10-23].

Vanadium sesquioxide (V203), an archetypal material with strong electronic correlations,
undergoes a high-temperature rhombohedral paramagnetic metal to a low-temperature monoclinic
antiferromagnetic insulator transition around 160 K. Neutron diffraction reveals a magnetic order
where V moments that are ferromagnetically coupled in monoclinic (010) layers tilted away from
the hexagonal c-axis by 71° [32], with a reversal between adjacent layers (Fig. la). The ordered
moment is (1.2 + 0.1) ug per V atom, and the spin excitation gap is 4.75 meV (1.15 THz, or 55

K) [33]. Resonant x-ray scattering experiments at the vanadium K edge found additional Bragg

peaks due to the long-range order of 3d orbital occupancy and demonstrated the existence of orbital
ordering in V203, which could account for its complex magnetic structure [34]. While V203 has
often been discussed as an example of a Mott insulator, the situation is quite subtle [35]. The nature
of the metal-insulator phase transition in V2O3 is complicated, with strong couplings between spin,
lattice, and charge degrees of freedom [36]. The antiferromagnetic (AFM) order in V20s, as
evidenced in Ni/V203/permalloy spin-valve devices, induces unexpected temperature dependence
across the V2O3 metal-insulator transition [37]. The AFM order can also significantly enhance the
exchange bias of an attached ferromagnetic permalloy layer, which appears at the onset of the
transition temperature [38]. However, to date, spin caloritronic measurements have not been

applied to V203.
In this work, we have investigated a local spin Seebeck effect (LSSE) in antiferromagnetic
203 thin films as a function of temperature, magnetic field, and film thickness using Pt electrodes.
At a fixed heater power and low temperature, the LSSE increases with field until it approaches
saturation. At fixed heater power and field, the LSSE has a non-monotonic temperature
dependence, with a pronounced peak at low temperatures that shifts toward higher temperatures
with increasing field. In contrast to the LSSE observed in paramagnetic VO? [30], the SSE signal
in AFM V203 decreases monotonically as a function of film thickness, implying that the measured
response stems from the bulk. These results imply that the thermal relaxation length between
magnons and phonons in V20s is less than 50 nm, consistent with the wealth of experimental

evidence for strong spin-lattice interactions in this material.

phase. The black spheres represent V atoms, with red and blue arrows showing the spin direction.
The moments of V atoms are aligned ferromagnetically on the (010) plane and reverse between
the neighboring layers. The cyan plane indicates the monoclinic (011)-oriented surface, which is
oriented along z in the devices examined. Oxygen atoms are omitted for clarity. The crystal
structure is generated by VESTA [39]. (b) Schematic of local spin Seebeck measurement. An AC
heater current produces an oscillating z-directed temperature gradient. A vertical (z-directed)
thermal spin current with the y component of the magnetization of the V2O3 would produce an ISH
voltage along the x-directed strong spin-orbit metal wire.

We grew V20s thin films (50, 100, 250, and 400 nm) epitaxially on r-cut sapphire substrates
via RF magnetron sputtering. Due to the lattice match, the V203 thin film favors a (011)-oriented
texture (in the low temperature monoclinic phase), where the moments of V are almost parallel to
the surface, and the surface is nominally magnetically compensated. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
measurements found essentially identical diffraction peaks for the different film thicknesses
reflecting the high temperature (012)/low temperature (011) orientation. The observed XRD peak
widths and the smooth, featureless background confirm that the films remain single-phase,
textured, and structurally coherent across the thickness range. A slight increase in out-of-plane
spacing with thickness indicates partial relaxation of substrate-induced strain. The Pt (or W) wire,
800 um long, 10 um wide, and 10 nm thick, was directly deposited on the V203 film surface using
standard photolithography, magnetron sputtering, and liftoff process, with wire orientations
parallel to the edge of the substrate. Because of the texture of the film, the wires are averaging
over all in-plane crystallographic orientations. A SiOx layer with a thickness of 100 nm and an Au
heater wire (1300 wm long, 10 um wide, 50 nm thick) were then fabricated above the Pt (or W)
wire by photolithography, e-beam evaporation, and liftoff. The Au heater wire and the Pt detector
wire are electrically isolated by the SiO, layer in between. An AC current at angular frequency
= 2n x (7.7 Hz) is driven through the Au wire, while the voltage across the Pt (or W) wire is
recorded at 2@ using a lock-in amplifier. The 2 y-component is the relevant signal, though both
phases of @ and 2 voltages were measured. The phase lag was very small (< 5°) over the full
temperature range of measurements. The measurements are performed as a function of temperature
and field in a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (9T-PPMS) equipped with
arotation stage. The films all have the metal-insulator transition at the expected temperature range

and are extremely insulating at cryogenic temperatures.

The schematic of the device is given in Fig. 1b. In the on-chip-heating configuration for
detecting the LSSE [40], an alternating current at frequency @ is applied to a heater wire. Local
Joule heating generates a temperature gradient along the normal direction of the film surface,
oscillating at 2@, which in turn drives a spin angular momentum current. A 2@ transverse voltage
along the x-direction can be detected at a nearby inverse spin Hall (ISH) detector made from a
strong spin-orbit metal (e.g., Pt, W) when the magnetization of the insulator is oriented in the y
direction. Thermal modeling of this device geometry [30, 41] shows that thermal transport from
the heater into the film is essentially vertical because the film thickness is far smaller than the
transverse dimensions of the Pt or Au strips. Prior experiments [41] on SiO2 substrates for much

larger heater powers than this work find the typical temperature rise of the Pt in this geometry is
~ 1K at | mW heater power at the lowest temperatures. The absence of saturation in the signal
vs. cryostat temperature in the present measurements is consistent with the sample temperature

being close to the PPMS recorded temperature.

Magnetic field dependence of the second harmonic voltage V2,, is shown for a 100 nm thick
Pt/V203 device when the field is applied in the film plane along the y-axis (a = 0°) (Fig. 2a, b). At
T =2 K, a pronounced V;,, signal appears, whose sign changes with respect to the B direction,

reflecting the symmetry of the ISHE. The signal shows approximately linear dependence near |B|

= 0 T, then saturates at high fields at 5 T. A full sweep of the field between +8 T exhibits no
hysteresis. As the temperature increases from 2 to 7 K, the overall magnitude of V2,, increases,
and the saturation region shifts to higher fields (Fig. 2a). However, above 7 K the signal magnitude
decreases and saturation behavior disappears (Fig. 2b). The signal vanishes above T = 50 K. In
Fig. 2c, the V2,, signal is normalized to its maximum value at 8 T for each temperature, to highlight
the nonlinear curvature at T= 2 K. As temperature increases, the nonlinearity becomes weaker
with the decrease of the zero-field slope. This field dependence of V2,, closely parallels to uniaxial
AFI MnF> [10], FeF2 [15] with field along the easy axis below the spin-flop fields, and also in
insulating SrFeO3-s thin films [14]. Recently, a similar field dependence was reported in uniaxial
AFI CrO3 when a field is applied along its hard-axis and interpreted as paramagnetic SSE from

weakly interacting spins near the Cr2O3 surface [23].

As a control experiment, the voltage responses for devices with Pt and W detectors show
opposite signs as seen in Fig. 2d. This is consistent with a genuine spin current effect, since Pt and
W are known to possess spin Hall angles of opposite signs [42]. Aside from this sign reversal, the

field dependence of the voltage in Pt/V203 and W/V20s is similar, indicating a common origin.

We further confirmed the magnetic origin of the measured signal by rotating the in-plane
magnetic field while keeping the field magnitude constant (|B| = 1 T,3 T, 5 T, 7 T) at3 K. Acosine
dependence of the V,,signal was observed (Fig. 2e). The SSE voltage reaches its maximum
magnitude when the field is perpendicular to the wire (along the y-axis); and the voltage crosses
zero when the field aligns along the wire (along the x-axis). The voltage from ISHE is given by
Eisyg XJ; X 0, where J, is the interfacial spin current density into the Pt and o is the spin-

polarization vector. Note that in our local SSE setup, J, is always directed along the z-axis parallel
to the temperature gradient and o aligns with the magnetization transported in the magnetic

insulator.

The observed dependence of V2,,signal on in-plane field orientation is the same as observed
in ferrimagnets and paramagnets [5,24]. Multiple mechanisms were suggested to explain this
dependence in antiferromagnets. In AFMs, the external magnetic field can produce a net
magnetization component along the field direction due to canting [10]. Alternatively, there are two
magnon branches that carry opposite senses of angular momentum. The energy gap associated
with each branch depends via Zeeman physics on the orientation and magnitude of the magnetic
field. It has been suggested in FeF2[15] reorienting B in the plane modulates the Zeeman splitting
of the magnon modes sinusoidally, leading to the same angular dependence of transported spin.
The SSE voltage scales linearly with the applied heater power (P) at two different |B] = 1 and 3 T
applied fields along the y-axis (a = 0°) (Fig. 2f).

Another effect with the same field orientation dependence in this geometry is the ordinary
Nernst-Ettingshausen response of Pt (W). The Nernst-Ettingshausen effect, related to transverse
scattering and its coupling to thermoelectricity, is linear with the applied magnetic field [41], and
thus cannot explain the observed nonlinear magnetic field dependence shown in Fig. 2a-c.
Furthermore, the previous study with the Pt (W) wire deposited directly on the SiO2/Si substrate
using an identical geometry yields a Nernst signal of only ~ 20 nV at 8 T under 1 mW heater

power [41], which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the signals measured in Pt/V203 devices.

lines showing linear behavior.

To elucidate the mechanism driving the spin Seebeck response in V203, we examined its
temperature dependence. Fig. 3a shows the LSSE voltage versus temperature in the same Pt/V203
device at fixed heater power and magnetic field for four applied fields. At each field, the LSSE
voltage increases as the temperature decreases, reaches a maximum at a peak temperature Tyegx.
After the peak, the signal decreases with further reducing temperature. Such peak behavior is also

observed in the ferrimagnet Y3FesOi2 (YIG) [43] and AFI MnF> [10] and FeF [15].

In ferrimagnetic YIG, the peak temperature in SSE voltage correlates with the peak
temperature of the thermal conductivity of YIG [43], explained by the phonon-drag mechanism.
This mechanism involves temperature-gradient-driven phonons that induce the spin current via

magnon-phonon interactions. In this case, the phonon-drag model [44] predicts Vosz x KVT = jg,
where x is the thermal conductivity, VT is the temperature gradient, and j, is the heat flux through
the interface. However, Iq is considered to be fixed in our measurement method, since the heater

power is held fixed and the thermal transport in our geometry is essentially all vertical [30, 41].

In AFI MnF; and FeF> [10,15], the peak behavior is explained in terms of the antiferromagnetic
magnon modes. The uniaxial AFI has two magnon modes (a and B) with opposite chirality. Since
B mode lies below a mode under an external field, only the 8 mode magnons are predominantly
populated at low temperatures. As the temperature increases, the 8 mode magnons population
continues to increase until the « mode magnons start to be occupied. Because of the opposite
angular momentum between a and B modes, the increasing temperature results in a peak in the net

spin current and consequently a peak in SSE voltage.

In V203, the peak temperature increases with increasing fields (Fig. 3b), similar to that in MnF>.
However, in FeF2, the peak temperature remains constant for all fields, an aspect that is not well
understood at present. The qualitative temperature dependence of Vss5, and its variation with field
(higher field leads to higher peak temperature) are very similar to what is observed in paramagnetic

VOz [30]. We shall discuss this further in the following section.

FIG 3. (color online) (a) Temperature dependence of the LSSE voltage, defined as the difference
of the second harmonic voltages between at a particular field and 0 T, in the Pt/V203 device at
constant heater power of 0.1 mW and a = 0°. (b) Field dependence of the peak temperature of the
LSSE signal in devices on different thicknesses of V2O3. For each thickness, the peak temperature
approximately linearly increases with the field. (c) The thickness dependence of the LSSE voltage
at 2 K in Pt/V203 devices at different fields. As thickness increases, the magnitude of the LSSE
voltage decreases.
The LSSE in an AFI has both a bulk contribution [45,46] from the temperature gradient in the
AFI and an interfacial contribution [47-50]. The interfacial contribution comes from the
temperature difference between the magnon temperature in the AFI and the electron temperature
in the spin-orbit metal. To distinguish between dominating bulk and interfacial contributions, we
fabricated devices with identical geometry, following the same fabrication protocols, but varying
the thicknesses of the V203 films. It is important to note that all devices exhibit similar magnetic
field and temperature dependencies of the LSSE signal, including linearity around zero field,
saturation at higher fields, weaker nonlinearity with increasing temperature, peak behavior with
temperature, and an increase in peak temperature with increasing field. However, strong thickness
dependence appears as the peak temperature at each field shifts upward for thicker films (Fig. 3b)
and the magnitude of the LSSE signal decreases consistently as the thickness increases (Fig. 3c).

We should consider possible mechanisms in the observed thickness dependence.

The spin Seebeck coefficient [43,51] is defined as ogse = (Vsse/l)/(dT /dz), where l is the
length of the ISH detector, and dT/dz is the temperature gradient across the insulator. At low
temperatures and with thin film materials, it is difficult to determine dT /dz experimentally, as this
would require measuring the local temperature in the magnetic insulator just below the interface
with the ISH detector and just above the interface with the film’s underlying substrate. These
interfacial local temperatures are generally not accessible, and at low temperatures the situation is
further complicated by enhanced thermal boundary resistances due to phonon mismatch. This
situation may be mitigated to some degree by working at fixed heater power, and hence
approximately fixed vertical heat flux, j,, through the film. One can then know or estimate the
film cross-plane thermal conductivity, «(T), or instead work with the spin Seebeck resistivity [52],

which is directly proportional to Vssz for fixed sample geometry and heater power.

Guo et al. found that in YIG films with thicknesses ranging from 150 nm to 50 um, the
magnitude of the spin Seebeck coefficient oss, increases gradually with thickness and saturating
beyond a critical thickness. The peak temperature shifts to a higher temperature as the film
becomes thinner [52]. These observations are explained by the combination of a temperature-
dependent magnon diffusion length A,, « T~1 and the thermal magnon density p,,(T). Only

magnons excited within a distance ~ 1,, from the interface can reach the detector and contribute
to the spin current. Thus, the SSE signal scales as Voz & py», X min(A,,,t). As the temperature
decreases from room temperature, A,, increases and p,, decreases. As /,, increases, the SSE
signal initially increases, allowing more magnons to reach the interface. However, once A»,
reaches the film thickness t, further cooling decreases p,,, causing the SSE signal to drop. This
competition leads to a non-monotonic temperature dependence. In thinner films, A, reaches t at

higher temperatures, resulting in the shift of the peak to higher temperatures.

In the Pt/V203, vertical thermal conduction at fixed heater power would imply a fixed
interfacial temperature difference T,,(Pt)-T,,(V2O3) (for unchanging thermal boundary resistance)
and a fixed temperature gradient VT,(V203) within the film, where T;,(Pt) and T,(V203) are the
phonon temperatures of Pt and V20s, respectively. If we assume that the spin current is generated
from the thermally excited magnons in the bulk V203, then the spin Seebeck voltage would be
expected to increase as the thickness increases and saturate when the thickness reaches 1,, [45,46].
However, instead, we observe a decrease in the signal as the thickness increases. Matching the
observation requires the interfacial spin mixing conductance to decrease faster than the thickness

factor increases, implying thicker films have more defects [23].

Another possible mechanism for decreasing SSE response with thicker films could arise from
a thickness dependent perpendicular thermal conductivity, «, of V2O3. If « increases with thickness,
the temperature gradient at fixed heater power would be lower for thicker films. Matching the
observation requires roughly an inverse relationship between thermal conductivity and thickness.

However, there is no reason to expect significant variation of « with thickness.

A particular explanation for the observed thickness dependence of the SSE signal is consistent
with the strong spin-lattice coupling known in V203. An alternative approach to quantifying SSE
responses uses the spin Seebeck resistivity [52], defined as Rggp = (Vssp/l)/jq, where jg is the
heat flux through the insulator. Prakash et a/. found that the SSE is a non-monotonic function of
YIG thickness ranging from 10 nm to | um with a peak at ~ 250 nm in Pt/YIG/gadolinium gallium
garnet (GGG) stacks, which is explained in terms of the energy-equilibration dynamics of magnons
to phonons in the YIG. The magnon energy relaxation length 2,, parametrizes the relaxation of the
magnon temperature T,, to the phonon temperature T,. When the film thickness is close to 1,

thermalization mechanisms between magnons in YIG and phonons in GGG lower the magnon
temperature T,, near the YIG/GGG interface, which contribute positively to the temperature
imbalance T;, — T;, in YIG. However, when the film thickness is larger than 1,,, these magnons
thermalize with phonons before reaching the Pt/YIG interface, thus this contribution vanishes,
leading to the peak behavior in thickness. If we assume the spin current is from the difference
between T,, and T, in the bulk of the V2Os, then the observed thickness dependence would imply
that the decrease in SSE voltage with increasing thickness is a consequence of /,, being smaller
than 50 nm, which is the thinnest studied sample here. Further measurements on ultrathin films

(i.e., those thinner than 50 nm) and bulk crystals would provide more insight.

We note that our previous studies found that the paramagnetic insulator vanadium dioxide
(VOz2) supports the paramagnetic SSE at low temperatures [30]. The current investigation finds
that AFI V203 and paramagnetic insulator VO2, though magnetically distinct, exhibit SSE signals
with the same sign, comparable magnitude under the same heater power with identical geometry,
and similar temperature and field dependences. We observed a field-induced suppression of the
SSE voltage at low temperature and high field in VO2, whereas V203 does not exhibit this
suppression. Still, the similarities in the LSSE response of the two oxides warrant discussion, and

it appears that the interface between oxide and Pt could potentially play a role.

Since VO2 and V203 were both grown on r-cut sapphire, the (012) plane of Al,O3 favors a
lattice-matching V atom arrangement analogous to Al atoms on the surface of Al2Os, ignoring
small lattice distortions. The Pt/oxide interface is where the exchange interaction between d
electrons of V and s electrons of Pt occurs, inducing the spin current into Pt. We also notice that
the SSE in Cr,03 when the field is along the hard axis is interpreted as paramagnetic in nature
from weakly interacting spins near the Cr2O3 surface. Thus, it is important to consider whether the

SSE signal in V203 can be understood as the paramagnetic SSE.

In a paramagnetic insulator (PI), the interfacial spin current, and thus the SSE voltage, is
expected to be roughly proportional to the magnetization of the PI described by a Brillouin function
B;(x) of the spin S, where x = gugB/KgT [29,53]. To check this, we examine whether the field
dependence of the voltage can be fitted with a Brillouin function. Under this assumption, the SSE

voltage can be written as:

v(B,T) = C1) Bs ( Gleb )

kp (T — Ocw)
where C(T) is temperature-dependent magnitude including thermal conductivity, and Ocy is a
possible Curie-Weiss temperature. Fig. 4 shows the fitting results with and without Ocyw. The
fitting excluding Ocy fails to capture the shape of the data accurately, whereas incorporating Ocw
gives good fits at each temperature. However, the extracted Oey , rather than being fixed as would
be expected, exhibits a strong temperature dependence, becoming increasingly positive as
temperature rises, indicating stronger ferromagnetic interactions. In V203, we expect the
interactions between the neighboring V ions to be antiferromagnetic. Thus, between this analysis
and the observed systematic thickness dependence in V203, we conclude that the LSSE observed

in V203 is not the interfacial paramagnetic SSE.

In conclusion, we observe a temperature-dependent longitudinal spin Seebeck response in
V203 thin films within the low-temperature antiferromagnetic phase. The behavior of the measured

LSSE voltage shares a significant feature with the paramagnetic LSSE response observed in VO2.
However, the magnitude of the LSSE signal decreases consistently with increasing thickness,
seemingly ruling out a dominant interfacial contribution to the SSE. This negative correlation
between the SSE and the thickness suggests that the energy relaxation length is shorter than 50 nm
in V203, consistent with strong spin-lattice coupling in V203. Additional studies of magnon modes

in V203 are required to resolve the nature of spin transport in this correlated system.
