ARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT

Keywords: The global ocean model NEMO is run in a series of stand-alone configurations (2015-2022) to

Water level investigate the potential for improving global medium-range storm surge forecasts by including

Storm surge the inverse barometer effect. Here, we compare a control experiment, where the inverse barome-

Inverse barometer effect ter effect was not included, against a run dynamically forced with mean sea level pressure. In the

Ensemble prediction systems control experiment, the inverse barometer effect was then calculated diagnostically and added
to the ocean model sea surface elevation, resulting in a total of three experiments to investigate.
We compare against the global GESLA3 water level data set and find that the inclusion of the
inverse barometer effect reduces the root-mean-square error by ~ 1 cm on average. When we
mask out all data where the observed storm surge is less than +1 or +2 standard deviations,
including the inverse barometer effect reduces the RMS error by 4 — 5 cm. While both methods
reduce water level errors, there are regional differences in their performance. The run with
dynamical pressure forcing is seen to perform slightly better than diagnostically adding the
inverse barometer effect in enclosed basins such as the Baltic Sea. Finally, an ensemble forecast

experiment with the Integrated Forecast System of the European Centre for Medium-range
Weather Forecasts demonstrates that when the diagnostic inverse barometer effect is included
for a severe storm surge event in the North Sea (Storm Xaver, December 2013), the ensemble
spread of water level provides a stronger and earlier indication of the observed maximum surge
level than the when the effect is excluded.

1. Introduction

The mean sea level varies on time scales ranging from hours (tides and synoptic weather) to decades (climate change
and large-scale climate fluctuations). In addition to the steric changes (expansion and contraction due to changes in the
heat content and the salinity of the ocean interior), changes to the meltwater input affect the long-term trends in still
water level. On much shorter time scales, we have the synoptic fluctuations caused by variations in the sea level pressure
of the overlying atmosphere, known as the inverse barometer effect (IB). This effect, where a decrease in the surface
pressure of 1 hPa leads to a local increase in water level of approximately 1 cm is a practical rule of thumb allowing
quick estimates of the impact of atmospheric pressure on the water level (Piecuch and Ponte, 2015). In addition,
frictional effects will lead to water level variations that have a much wider geographical extent. The simplest model on
a rotating sphere is the Ekman transport (Gill, 1982)[pp 319-322], where a balance is reached between the frictional
force of the wind on the sea surface and the Coriolis effect. When the water is pushed against a coastline, or drawn away
from the coastline, the effect typically sets up Kelvin waves trapped by the coast. Such water level variations can be
substantial, and are typically among the most devastating effects of tropical cyclones. The extratropics also experience
large fluctuations due to Ekman effects, dramatically demonstrated by, among other cases, the devastating storm surge
of 1953 in the North Sea (Wolf and Flather, 2005). Storm surge modeling is a routine activity of national hydro-
meteorological services (Kristensen et al., 2022) and can be carried out with modeling systems of varying degrees of
complexity, ranging from two-dimensional homogeneous equations of the vertically averaged (barotropic) current and
its associated water level to more complex fully baroclinic three dimensional ocean models. Such models are run on

regional scales and in some cases globally. The models can include the major constituents of the astronomical tide, or
these can be added diagnostically. Regional forecast systems typically rely on boundary conditions from basin-scale
or global model systems. Their horizontal resolution is high enough (4 km is a typical number) that local topographic
effects can be accounted for. Since water level is mostly a concern along coastlines (but not just, fixed platforms
must account for changes in the water level, and floating structures may have to account for tension on moorings),
such forecast systems are expected to yield reasonably accurate water level predictions in semi-enclosed waters.
Furthermore, the uncertainty associated with the passage of synoptic weather systems translates into uncertainty of
the water level they cause. Ensemble prediction is thus a natural approach for water level forecasting.

Here we present a comparison of two standalone global NEMO (Madec et al., 2024) ocean model integrations with
and without the atmospheric pressure effect, forced with the atmospheric reanalysis ERAS (Hersbach et al., 2020).
No astronomical tidal constituents are included in the model setup. The model runs cover the period 2015-2022,
inclusively. The purpose of our study is two-fold. First, we want to investigate how well a coarse (roughly 0.25°) fully
baroclinic ocean model can be expected to represent coastal and open-ocean water level variations associated with
the passage of tropical and extratropical cyclones. Secondly, we want to assess how well a model without the inverse
barometer effect (only Ekman effects) can be expected to perform. This we do by diagnostically adding the inverse
barometer effect to a control experiment with constant sea level pressure. The model is identical to the ocean model
component of the Integrated Forecast System (IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts
(ECMWF). See Mogensen et al. 2012 and Mogensen et al. 2017 for further details on the ocean model component of
IFS.

Two experiments have been performed to assess two alternative ways of including the IB effect and its impact on
the modeled sea surface elevation. This leaves us with three variables representing the water level, hereafter referred to
as noJB, the control experiment with no IB effect, diaJB, diagnostically adding the IB effect to the control experiment,
and finally dynJB, the water level from NEMO including the dynamically computed effect of the sea level pressure.
Wind stress, and its effect on the water level, is included in all three variables.

Finally, the ensemble prediction system of the IFS (ENS) is used to perform a case study of the North Sea winter
storm Xaver in December 2013. By examining the ensemble spread for the water level at two coastal locations in the
North Sea, the impact of including the diagnostic IB effect is explored for probabilistic forecasting.

The investigation illustrates the potential for local storm surge modelling, by exploring the impact in the global IFS
ensemble, which is commonly used to provide boundary conditions for high resolution Limited Area Models (LAMs).
It also highlights the usefulness of a global, relatively coarse, coupled atmosphere-ocean model for probabilistic
forecasting and early warning of storm surge along complex coastlines.

This article is structured as follows. In Section 2 we present the dataset of observations used in the validation.
In Section 3 the ocean model is described. In Section 4 we present statistics for the model results and the validation
results. In Section 5 a few case studies of storm surge events from within the hindcast period are evaluated in detail.
Section 6 showcases how the results from this research can have direct implications in operational forecasting of storm
surge. A summary and concluding remarks are found in Section 7.

2. Observational dataset

The observation dataset used in this work is the Global Extreme Sea Level Analysis version 3 (GESLA3), see Haigh
et al. 2023. GESLA3 is a comprehensive and freely available dataset containing observation records from 36 different
sources covering large parts of the globe. The dataset consists of 5119 stations with time series of observed total water
level (TWL) on a common data format, covering the period from 1800 until 2020. It contains an aggregated total of
91,021 years for all the records. We note that some observation stations are contained in more than one of the sources
used to compile the dataset, hence the total number of unique observation stations is less than the number of records.
The locations and geographical distribution of the records are shown in Figure |. To isolate the weather-induced
water level (hereafter referred to as the storm surge for brevity) from the TWL, we performed a tidal analysis of each
record using the 12 dominant tidal constituents in the pangeo-pytide python package, based on the FES2014 global
ocean tide atlas (Lyard et al., 2021), and subtracted this tidal signal from the observed TWL. The residual signal is
hereafter referred to as the observed storm surge. Before the analysis, the temporal mean for both model time series and
observation records is removed. We utilize all the records that overlap in time with our simulation period, located no
more than two grid points away from an ocean grid point in the model. This reduces the number of records to be used
in the analysis to around 1000 records. The blue dots in Figure | indicate the locations and geographical distribution of

the records used in our analysis, while the red dots indicate the records that was not used. All observation records have
been resampled to hourly time resolution through linear interpolation to facilitate the comparison with ocean model
data. This was done after the tidal analysis was performed.

A feature of the GESLA3 dataset is that some stations appear as multiple records in the dataset, i.e., are provided
from multiple sources, like, e.g., the national hydro-meteorological services and the Pan-European Copernicus Marine
Service (CMEMS). These seem to occasionally be resampled or interpolated from their original temporal resolution
to a different resolution, often hourly. When performing the tidal analysis on these records, and subtracting the tidal
signal from the TWL, we are often left with a very noisy storm surge signal. This tends to clutter the model evaluation
presented in Section 4, and even if our brief investigation into the issue suggests that the number of “noisy” data points
is small, this feature could have an impact on the general statistics when such records are included. More details and a
visual example can be found in 7. Attempts to remove these outliers has not been successful, and we are therefore left
with the choice of either omitting the records entirely, or leaving them in the dataset. We have chosen the latter.

3. Model setup

The NEMO ocean model (Madec et al., 2024) is here run with atmospheric forcing from the ERAS reanalysis
(Hersbach et al., 2020). The domain is a global stretched tripolar ORCA025 grid with an average resolution of
0.25 x0.25° which is refined threefold in the Equatorial band. The vertical is resolved with a z coordinate with variable
resolution. The upper level is 1 m thick. This setup is commonly referred to as ORCAO25_Z75. The ocean model reads
the 10 m wind vectors, temperature, humidity, heat and water fluxes from ERAS every hour. The ocean model also
reads forcing from the ECWAM wave model (a component of ERAS) as described by Breivik et al. 2015. We now
perform an ocean-only integration (experiment id i5k6) covering the period 2015-2022 (from a warm start). We then
compute the inverse barometer effect from the ERAS mean sea level pressure (MSLP) and output the total sea surface
elevation (including the inverse barometer effect) as well as the prognostic elevation (only frictional and baroclinic
effects). This control run is then compared against an otherwise identical ocean-only run where the ocean model is

allowed to respond to a varying MSLP taken from ERAS (experiment id i5k8). This run is referred to as the dynamical
experiment (dynIB) whereas the former is referred to as the diagnostic experiment (diaJB) (since we compute the
inverse barometer effect diagnostically from the local MSLP). Neither run includes tides. The variables of interest in
the control run are thus the sea surface elevation without the inverse barometer effect, referred to as no/B, and the sea
surface elevation including the diagnostically computed inverse barometer effect, dialB. These are compared against
the total sea surface elevation dynJB in the alternative model setup with dynamical MSLP.

In Section 6, we use the IFS ensemble prediction system (ENS, e.g. ECMWF, 2024a) to showcase how inclusion of
the IB effect can impact the probabilistic forecast of storm surges. ENS is a coupled global forecasting system, which
uses NEMO for its ocean model component, thus enabling us to explore how the impacts seen from the standalone
NEMO studies translate into a coupled forecasting scenario.

Both the uncoupled and coupled forecasts use NEMO version 4.0, which is a newer version than the 3.4 version
of NEMO which is currently in operational use at ECMWF. The coupled model runs were based on a development
version of IFS CY49R2 to incorporate the changes needed to run the coupled setup with NEMO V4.0.

4. Results

4.1. Model statistics

The map in Figure 2a display the maximum values for water level for each grid point for the global domain of the
NEMO model over the simulation period. The figure show the maxima for the diaJB run, and the difference between
the diaIB and dynIB runs. The map of maxima in Figure 2 is a good indication of the areas around the globe that are
prone to high water level due to storm surge. The Figure also highlight some of the well known dynamically active
regions with large ocean currents, like e.g. the Gulf Stream east of the US East Coast, the Agulhas Current south
and east of Africa and the Kuroshio Current east of Japan. Due to the fact that high water level usually only poses
a substantial risk to life and property when it occurs along a coast, we note a few coastal areas with large maxima
for further investigation. These areas include the European North West Shelf (NWS), the southeast coast of South
America, the southern and eastern coasts of the US and the coast of China. In addition, when examining the maxima
in Figure 2, we can clearly see the imprints of the tracks of many of the major tropical storms, hurricanes and typhoons
during the simulation period.

4.2. Model evaluation and validation

The control experiment with diagnostic inclusion of the IB effect (diaJB) and the alternative (dynIB) is compared
with the GESLA3 observations. As a baseline, we also compare against the control experiment without inclusion of
the IB effect (noJB). We focus the evaluation on the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the Root Mean Squared Error
(RMSE), together with scaled versions of the two (MAE/o and RMSE/o, where o is the standard deviation of the
observed storm surge). The values of MAE and RMSE for each record is scaled by the standard deviation of the

observed storm surge for that record to provide a measure of the relative error, since the magnitude of the absolute
error tends to be correlated with the magnitude of the storm surge, to allow us to compare the model performance
across different records with different typical amplitudes. This is in line with the approach by Kristensen et al. 2024,
and the formulas can be found in Appendix B.

The MAE and RMSE [m] for the water level of noJB, diaIB and dynIB are listed in Table 1. We focus on the median
of the error metrics across the records, but also include the mean values. The median is chosen as it is a robust estimate
of central tendency and thus suitable for analysis given the large outliers found in some of the observation records, as
explained in Section 2. We include the MAE and RMSE for the entire hindcast period, denoted by the subscript all,
and also values where we mask the data when the observed absolute values of the storm surge is less than one and
two standard deviations from the mean, denoted by the subscripts +1std and +2std. This is done to emphasize the
cases and time periods when the contribution from the storm surge to the total water level is significant to focus on the
model’s ability to capture anomalously low and high water level events (the latter being what we usually think of as
storm surges). Similarly, the relative (scaled) values MAE/o and RMSE/o, are presented in Table 2.

The absolute values of both MAE and RMSE in Table | clearly show that the errors increase when masking out
the low absolute values. Also, it is evident that diaJB has slightly lower errors, 1 cm less for both MAE and RMSE,
compared to the dynJB. When including all data, the best performing experiment, diaJB, has a MAE of 10cm and
RMSE of 13cm averaged over the entire global model domain and simulation period. When masking the data for
observations within +o, the MAE and RMSE for the dia/B increase to 12 and 15 cm respectively. And for the masking
criteria of observations within +20, the MAE and RMSE is 15 and 18 cm for diaJB, respectively. This is approximately
30% less than the MAE and RMSE of noJB. This clearly shows that, unsurprisingly, to properly simulate the water
level during an extreme storm surge event, the IB effect must be included.

However, Figure 3 shows that the statistical distribution of the RMSE has a large variation, with the majority of
the errors in the range 4 — 30cm and [0.3 — 1.6]o, when considering all data. It is evident that all the distributions,
except the relative noJB, are skewed to the right. This is as expected based on the mean and median values in Table |
and 2 where the mean value is generally larger than the median. The width of the distributions increases with stricter
masking criteria.

Additionally, the map in Figure 4 clearly shows the regional differences in performance between the two
experiments. The difference in relative error, displayed in Figure 4, highlights the European NWS and the Baltic Sea as
two regions (see also Figure 5) where the differences between the two experiments are large with diaJB outperforming

NMK, KM, S-JL, @B: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 5 of 22

dynIB on the European NWS, and vice versa in the Baltic Sea. Most other areas exhibit relatively small differences, with
a few scattered exceptions mostly in favor of the dia/B. It is unclear why the dynJB experiment seems to outperform the
diagnostic experiment in the semi-enclosed water body of the Baltic Sea. However, as we see a similar, albeit weaker,
tendency in the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea, we speculate that the narrow connections to the open ocean
limits the efficacy of the inverse barometer effect. These water bodies also have very small tidal amplitudes for the
same reason, see e.g., Medvedev et al. 2016. In other words, although the atmospheric pressure variations set up a
pressure gradient, the narrows connecting the Baltic Sea (Weisse et al., 2021), the Mediterranean Sea and the Black
Sea (respectively the Danish Straits, the Strait of Gibraltar and the Bosphorus) are not wide enough for water to adjust
on the synoptic time scales of hours to at most a few days. When the atmospheric pressure averaged over the entire
confined sea area changes, this will in the diaJB lead to a change in the average water level, whereas in reality and
in the dynJB, these changes in water level are mostly local, leaving the water level over the confined sea area mostly
unchanged during the passage of extratropical systems. This effect becomes more pronounced when the dimensions
of the confined water body coincides with the spatial extent of the weather systems.

5. Case studies

In addition to the general statistics, we now look at a few extratropical storm surge events on the European NWS,
as well as tropical cyclones. The selected cases are from the areas of maximum storm surge in Figure 2.

5.1. European/North Sea surges of January and February 2020

January and February 2020 was a particularly active storm period in Northern Europe with several large storm
surges. A series of powerful low pressure weather systems passed through Northern Europe from west to east, creating
prolonged periods of high water level along the coast, in particular around the North Sea basin. In Norway, two storms
during this time period were classified as “extreme weather events” and consequently were given names. These were
the storms Didrik on 15 January 2020 (Skjerdal et al., 2020), and Elsa 10-11 February 2020 (Selberg et al., 2020).
The storm Elsa was named Ciara in the United Kingdom (UK), see Jardine et al. 2023, but we choose here to refer to
it as Elsa.

5.1.1. Storm Didrik

The storm Didrik hit Southern Norway on 15 January 2020 (Skjerdal et al., 2020) with a forecast warning of
high water level along the coast. The low pressure system, with a central pressure as low as 945 hPa, formed off the
southern tip of Greenland on 12 January and moved eastward between Iceland and the UK the following days. It
brought with it strong westerly to south-westerly winds in the northern North Sea, which in addition to the inverse
barometer effect itself resulted in a large transport of water towards the western Norwegian coast. The maximum total
water level observed was among the top 10 highest for the stations from Stavanger in the south west to Alesund on the
north-western coast (Kristensen et al., 2024).

The maps in Figure 6 show the positions of the observations in southern Norway, colored by the average RMSE of
the daily maximum values for storm surge. The differences between the experiments are very small, and only clearly
visible for the locations furthest to the east, where the dynJB has larger errors than noJB and dialIB due to too large
amplitudes. This is also in line with the pattern in Figure 5. Time series for four selected stations in southern Norway
are shown in Figure 8, where the Oscarsborg station (panel (a)) located in the Oslofjord in southeastern Norway, most
clearly demonstrates how the amplitude at the maximum storm surge is overestimated. The heatmap scatterplots in
Figure 7 suggest that the dynJB is the best-performing experiment on average during storm Didrik with a correlation of
0.72 compared to 0.65 and 0.64 for the diaJB and noJB respectively. However, it is quite clear that the maximum values
of the modeled storm surge is closer to the observed surge for both no/B and diaIB compared to dyn/JB, indicating that
the overestimation of the storm surge at the south- and easternmost positions (as seen in panel (a) in Figure 8) in the
dynIB experiment compensates for the underestimation that can be seen in all experiments in the western and northern
stations.

5.1.2. Storm Elsa

The storm Elsa during 10-11 February 2020 (Selberg et al., 2020; Jardine et al., 2023) was the remnants of a
long-lived extratropical cyclone that re-intensified as it passed south of the southern tip of Greenland. The passage
eastward followed much the same path as the storm Didrik a month earlier. The maps in Figure 9 show the average

NMK, KM, S-JL, @B: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 6 of 22
Diagnostic vs dynamic IB in a global ocean model

RMSE for the daily maximum storm surge for all stations around the North Sea for the time period 9-12 February. The
difference between the no/B and diaJB experiments are only minor, while the dyn/B experiment stand out from the two
with slightly lower RMSE for the Skagerrak, Norwegian and offshore North Sea stations. The heatmap scatterplot in
Figure 10 also point to the dyn/B as the best performing experiment for the Elsa storm, with both higher correlation
and smaller departures from the diagonal. The time series for the four selected stations in Figure 11 show how the
dynIB, most often, does a better job than noJB and dialB at simulating both the daily maximum and the hourly water
level.

5.2. Tropical cyclones
5.2.1. Hurricane Michael

The category 5 Hurricane Michael, on its track from south to north through the Gulf of Mexico, hit the south coast
of western Florida near Mexico Beach on the 10 October 2018 (IL et al., 2019; Kennedy et al., 2020). With winds up to
70ms~! and a central pressure down to 919 hPa, Hurricane Michael also brought with it an estimated 3 m storm surge
(Kennedy et al., 2020).

Figure 12 shows the average RMSE for the daily maximum storm surge for the available records along the western
Florida coast for our three water level parameters. It is evident how important the IB effect is, but there are no
distinguishable differences between the diaIB and dynIB. The same is evident in the heatmap scatterplots in Figure
13, where the majority of the data points fall very close to the diagonal for the diaJB and dynIB, while the noJB has
slightly larger departures from the diagonal. This is also reflected in the linear correlations, 0.89 for the diaIB and dynIB
and 0.84 for noIB. The highest observed storm surge in our dataset is approximately 2.0m above mean sea level (for
the chosen time period), while the model only has a storm surge of approximately 1.25 m, as seen in Figure 13 and the
time series in Figure 14a. However, all the four selected stations in Figure 14 show a marked improvement of both the
hourly, and the daily maximum storm surge, with the introduction of the IB effect, but with no clearly visible difference
between dialB and dynIB. We note that even if there is a definite improvement in the results and reduction in error by
introducing the IB effect, the highest maximum water level is still significantly underestimated. At the Apalachicola
station (see Figure 14a, the maximum water level in the model is approximately 1 meter below the observed maximum
water level. This is likely caused by the known fact that the ERAS dataset exhibit generally too low wind speed and not
low enough core pressure for tropical cyclones (Dulac et al., 2024). Similar underestimation is likely to be expected if
examining other tropical cyclone cases.

5.2.2. Typhoon Mangkhut

Typhoon Mangkhut (Ying et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2019) formed over the western Pacific in the beginning of
September 2018, and intensified on its path westward towards the northern Philippines, where it made landfall as a
category 5 typhoon on 14 September. Moving further westward, the typhoon weakened to a category | typhoon before
making landfall in southern China, just south of Hong Kong, on 16 September 2018.

Figure 15 shows the average RMSE for the stations located in the South China Sea. The pattern of the errors is
similar to what was seen for Hurricane Michael in the previous section, where the introduction of the IB effect clearly
reduced the errors. The improvements are also apparent when examining the heatmap scatterplots in Figure 16. Further,
the time series from the two selected stations in Figure 17 clearly show how the simulations are improved by adding the
IB effect. Especially in Figure 17a, displaying the time series for Currimao at the north western part of the Philippines,
it is obvious how the IB effect is critical to achieve realistic model results. We note a similar, although not as extreme,
underestimation of the highest maximum water level in Figure 17, as mentioned and explained in the previous Section.

6. Operational use and implications for storm surge forecasting

We have demonstrated how the implementation of the IB effect in the NEMO model reduces the RMSE for water
level in a standalone ocean-only hindcast forced with ERAS surface winds and atmospheric pressure. Since the NEMO
model is the ocean component in the fully-coupled ECMWE earth system forecast model (IFS), it is interesting to
explore the impact of including the IB effect in a coupled forecast.

For operational medium-range forecasts, the IFS is run as an ensemble prediction system (ENS, e.g. ECMWF,
2024a), comprising 50 perturbed forecasts and one unperturbed (‘control’) forecast. The perturbed forecasts are
designed to represent uncertainties due to the initial conditions and the model integrations (‘model uncertainty’), thus
providing a description of forecast probabilities.

NMK, KM, S-JL, @B: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 7 of 22
Diagnostic vs dynamic IB in a global ocean model

The perturbed initial conditions are generated via an ensemble of 4D-Var data assimilations (EDA Buizza et al.,
2008; Isaksen et al., 2010; Lang et al., 2019) and singular vectors (Leutbecher and Palmer, 2008), which are both
added to a central 4D-Var analysis (Rabier et al., 2000). In addition, uncertainties in the ocean initial conditions are
represented with the use of 11 perturbed ocean analyses (Zuo et al., 2024).

Model uncertainties are represented via the Stochastically Perturbed Parameterisations scheme (SPP: Leutbecher
et al., 2024; Lang et al., 2021; Ollinaho et al., 2017), which introduces random perturbations to uncertain processes in
the atmospheric physics parametrisations throughout the forecast integration.

To explore the impact of including the IB effect, we ran an ensemble experiment using the operational configuration
of the IFS (experiment id i066): one unperturbed and 50 perturbed forecasts, to 15 days. The atmospheric model uses
the cubic octahedral reduced gaussian grid TCo1279 (approximately 9km grid-spacing) with 137 vertical levels. The
atmospheric model is coupled to the ECMWF Wave Model (e.g. ECMWF, 2024b), the ORCA025_Z75 configuration
of NEMO V4.0 (as previously described), and the LIM2 sea-ice model (Fichefet and Maqueda, 1997).

6.1. Ensemble simulations of the North Sea storm Xaver

Storm Xaver moved slowly from west to east across Northern Europe during 5-7 December 2013 (Deutschlinder
et al., 2013; Kristensen et al., 2024). The strong northerly winds over the North Sea resulted initially in a convergence
of water along the eastern coast of the United Kingdom due to Ekman transport. When the wind direction started to
back left, this water started to move anti-clockwise along the North Sea coastline as a free Kelvin wave. The combined
Kelvin wave with local amplifications due to Ekman transport by the wind, and the inverse barometer effect resulted
in a storm surge among the top five highest recordings over the last 100 years in the German Bight according to
Deutschlinder et al. 2013.

As the low pressure system moved further east, and the wind direction continued backing further left, the storm
surge signal moved further through the North Sea up along the western coast of Denmark and into the Skagerrak area
as a Kelvin wave (see Kristensen et al. 2024).

The forecasts are initialized daily at 00 UTC from the operational IFS initial conditions for the period from 2013-
11-23 to 2013-12-07. To capture the IB effect, the experiment uses a research branch based on IFS CY49R2. The IB
effect is estimated diagnostically from the mean sea level pressure from the IFS. We show how the coupled IFS ENS is
able to forecast and give warning about the possibility of this very rare record event up to more than a week in advance
in Figure 18. We selected two stations in the area of some of the highest observed storm surge during this event, namely
the German station Cuxhaven, located in the German Bight in the southeastern North Sea, and the Danish station Hvide
Sande, located at the western coast of Jutland, Denmark. The ensemble forecast provides an estimate of the uncertainty
in a given forecast parameter via the ensemble spread: where the ensemble spread is largest, the uncertainty can be
assumed to be greatest (and vice versa). In Figure 18, the ensemble spread is indicated by the shaded area that describes
the ensemble range — the difference between the maximum value across the ensemble members and the minimum
value. It is evident that by utilizing the entire ensemble, as opposed to only the control member (indicated by the solid
lines with the round dots), there is a signal of a maximum surge level as large as the observation more than 5 days in
advance at Cuxhaven and throughout the whole forecast period for Hvide Sande.

The exceedance probability, defined as the number of ensemble members, as a percentage, exceeding a certain
threshold (in this case, we used the maximum observed storm surge) for a given forecast lead time, is shown as the
lower solid lines with square dots in both panels in Figure 18. For Cuxhaven, when we include the IB effect, the
exceedance probability is larger than zero five days ahead of the event, and increases from three days ahead, to around
35% by day zero. For Hvide Sande, with the IB effect included, the exceedance probability is above zero from more
than 12 days ahead of the largest storm surge, with a strong increase from day five to above 50% by day zero. By
contrast, the forecasts that do not include the IB effect show exceedance probabilities at both locations of less than
10% even at day zero.

In operational forecasting applications, information from the real-time ENS runs can be assessed relative to the
model climate, which is constructed from hindcasts (see e.g. Owens and Hewson, 2018, Section 5.3). This makes it
possible to identify cases where the latest ENS forecasts are shifted towards extreme values. The stronger and earlier
signal of large maximum storm surge levels from including the IB effect could ultimately provide even earlier warnings
of extreme conditions than is indicated from our assessments of absolute forecast values.

7. Summary and conclusions

The purpose of the present work has been to evaluate two methods of including the inverse barometer effect in a
stand-alone global ocean model. The model parameter under consideration is the weather-induced water level, and the
two methods tested were to either add the IB effect diagnostically as a post process to a model run with constant sea
level pressure (diaIB), or the direct dynamical inclusion during the model integration (dynJB).

The modeled water level was compared against the Global Extreme Sea Level Analysis version 3 (GESLA3), a
global dataset of water level observations. The general statistics that include all available model and observation data
co-located in time and space yields a MAE of 11 cm for no/B, 10 cm for dia/B and 11 cm for dynIB. The corresponding
RMSE values are 14cm, 13cm and 14cm, respectively. The weather-induced contribution to the total water level is
generally small. To better emphasize how well the three different parameters perform during larger storm surge events,
we masked data where the absolute value of observed storm surge (relative to MSL) was less than one and two standard
deviations. This obviously results in increased values for both MAE and RMSE for all three parameters (across all
stations considered), with e.g., an RMSE increase of 4cm for noJB, while both diaIB and dynIB increase by 2 cm for
the masked data less that one standard deviation. When masking data where observations are less than two standard
deviations, the RMSE increases with 11 cm, 5cm and 5 cm for the no/B, dialB and dynIB, respectively, compared to
the average RMSE over all measurements across all stations. In addition, the RMSE varies geographically between
the stations and between the three parameters, as shown in the histograms in Figure 3. The geographical differences
between the diaJB and dynIB are partly grouped, as seen in Figure 4 and 5 where the diaJB performs better than the
dynIB on for example the European North West Shelf, and vice versa in the Baltic Sea. Generally, except for the Baltic
Sea, the diaIB performs best, or the two perform equally. This is a key finding, since this demonstrates that all ocean
models, even those that have no means of including the IB effect dynamically at integration time, can include the IB
effect diagnostically as a post process to take into account the pressure effect on the storm surge water level.

In addition to the general statistics, a series of case studies were analyzed to highlight the differences between the
experiments for a few concrete cases. The time period covered by the model simulation contains several cases of strong
extratropical and tropical cyclones. We analyze the two European winter storms Didrik and Elsa (the latter is known as
storm Ciara in the UK), together with the cyclones Hurricane Michael and Typhoon Mangkhut. For the Didrik and Elsa
cases, the combined statistics for all the selected stations indicate that the the dynJB is the best performing parameter
with both highest correlation, and lowest RMSE. As seen in the maps in Figure 6 and 6, this is not the case for all
stations, especially for the Skagerrak stations during Didirk, where the diaIB and noJB has lower RMSE than dyn/B.
Whereas the same stations exert lower RMSE for dynJB than dia/B and noJB during Elsa. Together with the previously
mentioned geographical differences, this highlights how one of the alternative methods of including the IB effect is not
always better than the other, and despite the fact that the diaIB yields the lowest average errors, local considerations
should be taken into account. Based on the analysis of the two tropical cyclones, i.e. Hurricane Michael and Typhoon
Mangkhut, there is a key point to be made, namely that although the inverse barometer effect must naturally be included
to properly simulate and predict the change in water level due to storm surge, adding it diagnostically as a post process
is a perfectly acceptable alternative for coarse models.

To further assess and exemplify how the inclusion of the IB effect in a global ocean model can improve storm surge
early warnings, we show the performance of storm surge derived from ECMWF ENS forecasts for Storm Xaver. In this
case, the model was able to predict the possibility for the very rare and extreme event up to 12 days in advance when
including the IB effect. We note that trying to accurately forecast and predict an extreme event such as Xaver is very
challenging for a 0.25° global model. Usually, the criterion for issuing warnings of high water level is linked to return
periods, such as 5, 50 or 100 years (see e.g. Kristensen et al. 2022). So, the evaluation against the maximum observed
storm surge for an event ranked top 5 over the last 100 years, as is done in the present work, should be considered a very
strict criterion. The Storm Xaver case, and the use of the ensemble prediction system, highlights how the inclusion of
the IB effect in the ENS forecasts with the global NEMO model makes the forecasts more capable of providing early
warning of extreme storm surge events.

To recapitulate, it is evident that NEMO, a global quarter degree resolution ocean model, forced with ERAS winds
and pressure fields is capable of reproducing quite faithfully the water level variations associated with the passage
of both extratropical and tropical storms, even when compared against water level measurements (detided) in narrow
fjords and estuaries. This is encouraging as it suggests that the current setup of ECMWF’s IFS can be used as boundary
conditions for regional water level forecast systems with the simple addition of the inverse barometer effect. It also

NMK, KM, S-JL, @B: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 9 of 22

shows that an ensemble forecast system such as IFS can be used for early warnings of dangerous storm surges associated
with tropical cyclones and extratropical storms.

The y-axis gives the storm surge relative to mean sea level [cm], while the x-axis indicates the forecast lead time (in days)
prior to the time of the maximum observed storm surge. Please note that since there is only one daily run (starting at
OOUTC) of the ENS, and the maximum storm surge occurs at different times at different stations, the forecast lead times
will vary between the stations. In addition, the two lowest lines of each plot (with square markers) indicate the exceedance
probability (with the maximum storm surge as criterion) in percent, as expressed by the right side y-axis, for the entire

Figure 19: Time interpolation of the observed TWL can create a noisy storm surge signal when subtracting the tides
resulting from a harmonic analysis from the TWL. To show this feature we have selected the station of Aberdeen in the
United Kingdom. In the GESLA3 dataset this station is represented by a record originating from the British Oceanographic
Data Centre (BODC) with a time resolution of combined hourly (pre 1993) and 15 minutes resolution, and a record from
CMEMS with hourly resolution. When inspecting the two, the latter seems to utilize some kind of time interpolation based
on the first. The resulting storm surge signal is displayed in the time series in panels (a) and (b) based on the BODC
and CMEMS data, respectively. An example of how this influence the validation is shown in panels (c) and (d), where the
heatmap scatter plots (on log-scale) show the comparison between the model (Diagnostic IB) and observations based on
the BODC and CMEMS data, respectively.

Appendix A: Errors in observations

As explained in Section 2, there is clearly an effect where resampling of original observation data to, e.g., hourly
temporal resolution will introduce small errors in the tidal analysis, and hence result in outliers when subtracting
the computed tidal signal from the observed TWL to obtain the storm surge. An example of this feature is shown in
