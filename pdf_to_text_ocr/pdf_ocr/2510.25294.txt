Abstract

Trapped ions in micro-cavities constitute a key platform for advancing quantum information
processing and quantum networking. By providing an efficient light—-matter interface within a
compact architecture, they serve as highly efficient quantum nodes with strong potential for scalable
quantum network. However, in such systems, ion trapping stability is often compromised by surface
charging effects, and nearby dielectric materials are known to cause a dramatic increase in the ion
heating rate by several orders of magnitude. These challenges significantly hinder the practical
implementation of ion trap systems integrated with micro-cavities. To overcome these limitations,
we present the design and fabrication of metal-shielded micro-cavity mirrors, enabling the stable
realization of ion trap systems integrated with micro cavities. Using this method, we constructed a
needle ion trap integrated with fiber Fabry—Pérot cavity and successfully achieved stable trapping
of a single ion within the cavity. The measured ion heating rate was reduced by more than an
order of magnitude compared with unshielded configurations. This work establishes a key technique

toward fully integrated ion—photon interfaces for scalable quantum network.
I. INTRODUCTION

In quantum networks, efficient quantum interfaces require strong coupling between static
and flying qubits [1]. Numerous experiments have identified photons as ideal flying qubits
[2-8], while placing static qubits inside optical cavities can greatly enhance their interaction
with photons [9-11]. Consequently, extensive studies have been conducted on the interaction
between various materials and optical cavities [6, 7, 12-22].

The fiber Fabry-Pérot cavity (FFPC), serving as an open microcavity, provides a compact
and highly integrable platform for light—matter interaction. Owing to its fiber-coupled inter-

faces, photons can be directly collected and transmitted through optical fibers. The reduced

mode volume enhances the coupling strength between the ion and the cavity field, thereby
facilitating high-bandwidth quantum repeater implementation. Advances in microfabrica-
tion techniques [23] have enabled successful coupling of diverse emitters to FFPC, including
nitrogen—vacancy (NV) and silicon—vacancy (SiV) [24-26], quantum dots [27], neutral atoms
[28-33], and trapped ions [34-36]. Among these, trapped ions stand out as excellent sta-
tionary qubits with long coherence time and high-fidelity control [37-39], while being stable
trapping without reloading. Ion-FFPC integrated system (IFIS) thus combines the ions’
superior coherence and controllability with efficient light collection and scalable interfacing,

providing a promising route toward quantum network nodes with high efficiency.

However, two main challenges arise in the IFIS: (i) stray ultraviolet light causes charge
accumulation on the fiber surface mirror [40], leading to ion-trapping instability [41]; and (ii)
the nearby dielectric mirrors can increase the ion heating rate by several orders of magnitude
[42]. A common approach is to surround the fiber with a metallic shield, such as a metal tube,
which has enabled stable ion—cavity coupling [35, 36, 43-48]. Nevertheless, this approach
still faces several practical challenges, including limited fiber alignment precision [49]. Here,
we present a fabrication technique for metal-shielded fiber-cavity mirrors that preserves
optical transmission at the fiber end face while forming a metallic mask on both the fiber
side and the outer annular region of the end face to maximize shielding. Compared with
the metal-tube method [50], our design exposes a smaller fiber area, providing stronger
suppression of electric-field noise. Moreover, the gold layer exhibits excellent thickness
uniformity and reproducibility, enabling fiber alignment with precision on the order of a few

micrometers. We demonstrate that this structure effectively reduces charge accumulation
and significantly suppresses dielectric-induced ion heating, as confirmed by finite-element
simulations following [42]. We further characterized the cavity finesse before and after
processing, finding negligible degradation for cavity lengths up to 150 wm and acceptable
performance at 250m . Using this fiber electrode in a needle-trap system, we have achieved
stable single-ion trapping. The measured heating rate is consistent with the simulation

results.

II. DESIGN AND SIMULATION

In the IFIS, the FFPCs primarily influence the trapped ions in two key ways: (i) the
accumulation of positive charge on the fiber surface due to photoelectric effect, and (ii) the
presence of nearby dielectric layers can significantly increase the ion heating rate. In the
following sections, we model and analyze each of these effects separately, and discuss how

our process mitigates both issues.

A. light-induced charge

Since the cooling and ionization light for the majority of ions is ultraviolet or near-
ultraviolet, irradiation on the optical fiber surface induces the photoelectric effect, causing
electrons to be emitted from the valence band of the SiO2 material on the fiber surface,
leading to the accumulation of positive charge. Due to the fiber’s extremely low electrical
conductivity (107!4 ~ 10718 S/m), the accumulated positive charges cannot be efficiently
conducted away, leading to continuous charge buildup on the fiber surface. As the charge
accumulates, the electrical potential on the fiber surface increases. Although the fiber has
very low conductivity, it is not entirely non-conductive. As the electrical potential on the
fiber surface rises, the current needed to conduct away the accumulated charge also increases.
Once this current reaches a balance with the rate at which charge accumulates, a dynamic
equilibrium is reached, and the charge accumulation on the fiber surface ceases. Assuming
that scattered ultraviolet light is uniformly distributed in space, the irradiance on the fiber
surface per unit area is constant, meaning the rate of positive charge generation per unit
area is also constant. This rate can be expressed as a surface current density i+. The total

current is then given by I+ = f[ hh 5? do, where S represents the total exposed surface area

FIG. 1. Photoelectric effect. (a) The optical fiber is fully exposed. (b) The optical fiber is enclosed

of the fiber. Based on measurements in [51], it takes approximately one week for the fiber
to accumulate charge up to 4 e-ym7?, leading to an estimated surface current density of
it ~10-PA-m?.

Three scenarios are considered: no shielding, the fiber is enclosed in a metal tube, and
the fiber’s end face center is exposed, as illustrated in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1(a), both the fiber’s
end face and side surfaces accumulate charge, and these charges can only be conducted away
through the long fiber, resulting in a significant resistance. Additionally, the larger exposed
surface area leads to a higher current J+, which causes the electrical potential on the fiber
surface to rise substantially. In Fig. 1(b), the fiber is enclosed in a metal tube, with the fiber
fixed within the tube using optical thermosetting adhesive. This configuration ensures that
no charging occurs on the fiber’s side and accelerates the dissipation of accumulated charges
from the fiber surface, as they no longer need to traverse the long fiber. As a result, the
electrical potential on the fiber surface decreases by several orders of magnitude compared
to Fig. 1(a). In Fig. 1(c), a gold layer is deposited on the fiber surface, exposing only the
essential central optical region of the end face, thereby maximizing the fiber’s shielding. The
exposed area is reduced further to one-quarter of that in Fig. 1(b), and the path required
for the conduction of these charges is thereby shortened. Therefore, Fig. 1(c) results in a

further reduction in the electrical potential on the fiber surface.

To investigate the influence of this surface current on the pseudopotential distribution, we
modeled a blade trap and optical fiber cavity, simulating the pseudopotential distribution

within the trap using finite element software, as illustrated in Fig. 2(a). A blade trap is

4
selected because, in the case of a needle trap, it would be necessary to apply an Radio
Frequency (RF) signal to the metal shielding layer outside the optical fiber. However, in
subsequent simulations, the shape of the metal shielding layer at the end face of the optical
fiber varies, which would lead to differences in the distribution of the pseudopotential. To
investigate the effect of the charging current in the exposed region of the optical fiber on
the pseudopotential, it is required to vary the exposed area of the optical fiber under the
condition of a consistent pseudopotential distribution. Therefore, although we apply an RF
signal to the fiber electrode in subsequent experiments, in the simulation conducted here,
we choose to insert an optical fiber with a metal shield biased with a Direct Current (DC)
voltage into the blade trap.

The trapping potential ®gr generated by the RF electrodes is the time-averaged equiva-
lent pseudopotential produced by the alternating voltage U(7,t) = Ugr(7’) cos(Qret) applied

to the RF electrodes. Its expression is given by

e

®pr(7)

where e is the unit charge, m is the mass of !3°Ba* ion, and Ogp is the angular frequency of
the RF signals. To obtain the pseudopotential distribution generated by the RF electrodes,
we apply a voltage Upp to the electrodes in the finite element software and set the boundary
conditions, where other electrodes and infinite space are at zero potential. The resulting
potential distribution Ugr(7’) can then be used to calculate the corresponding equivalent
pseudopotential distribution ®gp(7) using the Eq. 1. For the DC electrodes, the potential
distribution must be computed separately. For the i-th DC electrode, we set the potential
of all other electrodes and infinite space to zero, resulting in the potential distribution
®pc,i(7) produced by the i-th electrode in space. The potential due to the surface current
on the fiber is calculated similarly to the DC electrode potential. Once the surface current
is set, we set the potentials of all other electrodes and infinite space to zero and solve for
the potential distribution ®current(7) due to the surface current on the fiber. The total

confinement potential experienced by the ion is then given by

(7) = ®per(7) + » ®pci(7) + Deurrent (7). (2)

The fiber is modeled as a cylinder with a diameter of125 zm and a length of 60mm, with
the metal tube in Fig. 1(b) having an inner diameter of 150 zm and an outer diameter of
190 pm. In Fig. 1(c), the thickness of the metal shielding layer is 10 zm, and the central
exposed area has a diameter of 60 zm. The four central blades, each 2.2 mm wide, are
loaded with an RF signal, with opposite pairs of blades applying the signal with a 180°
phase difference. In the simulation, Vo = 30 V, Orr = 27a x 20 MHz, and the voltage applied
to the eight Endcap electrodes is Vendcap = 100V. The resulting pseudopotential distribution
is shown in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2(a), a surface current density of 10? A-m7? is applied to the
fiber’s end face and the side surface within 200 zm from the fiber’s tip. In Fig. 2(c), the
surface current density is applied only to the central exposed region of the fiber’s end face.
Fig. 2(b, d) show the pseudopotential distribution through « = 0 for Fig. 2(a, c), respectively.
As seen in Fig. 2(b), without the metal shielding, the surface current on the fiber distorts
the pseudopotential into a double-well shape, with the lowest potential point deviating from
the center by nearly 400 um, and the potential barrier in the center reaching 1.4eV. When
the fiber is enclosed in a metal tube, as shown in Fig. 2(d), the pseudopotential distribution

can be well approximated by a quadratic function, with the fitting error within 1.5 meV for

the + 200 pm region.

In Fig. 2(e), the fiber is enclosed in a metal tube, and the surface current density is in-
creased by two orders of magnitude to 107! A-m7?. As seen in Fig. 2(f), the pseudopotential
distribution forms a double-well shape. In Fig. 2(g), the fiber is maximally shielded, expos-

ing only the central 60 jm area of the end face with a surface current density of 107!° A-m-?.

From Fig. 2(h), it can be seen that the fitting error in the + 200 ym range is only 4meV,

effectively shielding the effect of the surface current density of 107!° A-m-?.

B. heating rate

In ion trap systems, the primary source of ion heating is electric field noise [52, 53]. Ions
undergo secular motion within the potential well[54], causing changes in the electric field
distribution created by the ions. These variations in the electric field lead to modifications in
the surface charge distribution on both the electrodes and the dielectric. When a dielectric is
positioned near the ion, or when the ion-dielectric distance is comparable to the ion-electrode
distance, the energy required to alter the charge distribution on the dielectric surface is

significantly higher than that needed to modify the charge distribution on the electrode.

6
According to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) [55], the energy dissipated by the
ion into the surrounding environment is equal to the energy exerted by the environment’s
reaction on the ion. This implies that when a dielectric is present, the heating power
experienced by the ion is significantly greater than in the absence of the dielectric. This is
the primary source of ion heating in the IFIS.

We use the method proposed in [42] to simulate the heating rate of our system. d is the
distance between the ion and the fiber end face, which also corresponds to the cavity length
of 2d. The electric field noise power spectrum, S(w), which is due to the dissipation in the
dielectric at temperature T, can be written as [53]

where AE; denotes the vector difference in the electric field between the ion at the origin
and at a displacement of 6; = A in the ¢ direction, where i = x,y, z. w; is the ion’s secular
motion angular frequency, which is also the phonon frequency in different directions. kg is
the Boltzmann constant, €9 is the vacuum permittivity, V is the dielectric volume, ¢€, is the
relative permittivity, and tand is the loss tangent of the material. The ion heating rate is
given by [53]

4mhw;

In the simulations presented in this paper, the phonon frequency along the fiber axis is
2m x 2.85 MHz [56], and the phonon frequency perpendicular to the fiber axis is 27 x 1.3 MHz.
Throughout this work, the heating rate discussed refer to the ion’s heating rate along the
cavity axis. For the IFIS, the cavity mode forms a standing wave along the cavity axis with

a period corresponding to half the optical wavelength, typically on the order of hundreds of

n

nanometers—much smaller than the mode diameter, which is on the micrometer scale. The
heating rate directly determines the ion’s temperature and motional amplitude, which in
turn influence the ion-cavity coupling strength. Consequently, the ion’s heating rate along

the cavity axis has a significant impact on the coupling strength than those along the two

orthogonal directions. Therefore, in this work we focus exclusively on the heating rate along
the cavity axis.

It has been shown that when the ion is located at a distance d from an infinite dielectric

plane, 2 «x d~®, with a = 3 [53]. However, since the fiber end face is not an infinite dielectric
plane, the exponent a becomes 4.016(6) [42]. When the fiber is enclosed in a metal tube, the
exponent becomes a = 4.4 [50]. A larger value of a indicates that the heating rate decreases
more rapidly as the ion-dielectric distance increases.

We simulated the dependence of the heating rate on the cavity length for various optical
region diameters 2r, as illustrated in Fig. 3. A smaller r corresponds to a reduced exposed
area of the fiber cavity mirror, which leads to a substantial increase in the power-law expo-
nent a. Our fabrication process yields an exponent of a = 5.98 when r = 30 zm, compared
to a = 4.4 obtained in the metal-tube enclosure approach [50]. This steeper scaling behav-
ior indicates that the heating rate in our method decreases more rapidly with increasing
cavity length. Consequently, our process provides a significantly stronger suppression of

dielectric-induced heating effects, particularly as the cavity length L increases.

Ill. METHOD AND EXPERIMENT

The experiment utilized a LMA-8 photonic crystal fiber (PCF), characterized by a central
microstructure of air holes running along its length. Given that subsequent processing

involves various chemical liquids, the ingress of these liquids into the internal air channels

via the end-face poses a critical risk. Even if thermal treatment could be employed to clear
the bulk liquid from the fiber channels, the complete removal of crystallization residues or
other impurities remaining after chemical evaporation cannot be guaranteed. Such residual
contaminants would detrimentally impact light transmission through the fiber. To mitigate
this, we employed an arc discharge method. This technique serves a dual purpose: (i) it
effectively seals and protects the internal hole region of the fiber, and (ii) it enables the
formation of a concave surface suitable for the fiber cavity (as illustrated in Fig. 4(b) and
referenced in [57]).

The LMA-8 fiber possesses an initial head diameter of 240 wm. If the designed cavity
length is maintained at approximately 250 wm, the resulting geometry restricts the optical
access at the fiber side surface, limiting the light transmission angle to within approximately
45°. This severe angular constraint significantly complicates the arrangement of cooling light
delivery and other necessary optical paths. To enhance this optical access, the fiber head
must undergo hydrofluoric acid (HF) etching following the arc discharge treatment, thereby
reducing the diameter from 240 ym to approximately 120 jum, as illustrated in Fig. 4(c).

10
Following the etching process, a high-reflective (HR) coating is deposited onto the fiber
end face. Subsequently, the fiber end face is subjected to photolithography to pattern a
photoresist layer. This process leaves a photoresist mask with a 100 wm diameter. The
photoresist employed for this application is AZ5214E photoresist, which was utilized in an
image-reversal process to achieve negative-tone patterning. In the following part, we will
describe each fabrication step in detail.

First, a pre-bake step is performed by placing the sample fiber on a 80°C hotplate for 1
minute. This step helps evaporate the solvent from the photoresist, improving its adhesion
to the fiber end face. Next, an exposure step is conducted, as illustrated in Fig. 4(e). A
405m laser is coupled into a PM-S405-XP fiber, which serves as the exposure light source for
photolithography, referred to as the exposure fiber. The exposure fiber and the sample fiber
are placed in a fiber splicer to achieve precise alignment and control of the end-face distance
between the two fibers. The exposure fiber delivers 9 uW of 405 zm light power, producing a
15 yzm-diameter spot at the sample fiber end face, which is positioned approximately 100 um
away from the exposure fiber and the exposure time is 1.5s.

Following the exposure, a reversal bake is performed by placing the sample fiber on a
120°C hotplate for 1 minute. This process renders the photoresist in the initially exposed
region insoluble during development, while the unexposed outer ring remains photosensitive.
Subsequently, a flood exposure is carried out—this step resembles a standard photolithog-
raphy procedure and does not impose strict requirements on exposure intensity or duration,
provided that the total exposure dose is sufficient. The purpose of this step is to expose the
previously unexposed outer ring, enabling its removal during the subsequent development
process. Development is then performed for 2 minutes to dissolve and remove the outer an-
nular regions that have only undergone flood exposure, as illustrated in Fig. 4(f) and 5(c).
Finally, the fiber tip is briefly immersed in deionized water to eliminate any residual devel-
oper on the fiber surface, thereby preventing contamination that could affect the following

sputtering step.

Through these steps, we can leave a photoresist mask in the 100 “m central region of
the fiber end face, which will serve as the mask for subsequent processes. Following the
photolithography process, a 20 nm titanium adhesive layer is first deposited using magnetron
sputtering, followed by a 100 nm gold layer, as illustrated in Fig. 4(g) and 5(d).

Following magnetron sputtering, a thin gold film is deposited across the exposed fiber

11
surface. However, due to the inherently poor adhesion of sputtered metals to the photoresist,
the gold layer on the central 100jum region is only weakly bonded. During the lift-off process,
the fiber sample is immersed in an acetone bath and subjected to ultrasonic agitation. The
induced cavitation and fluid motion facilitate the removal of the weakly adhered gold film,
thereby exposing the underlying photoresist layer. The exposed photoresist is then rapidly
dissolved by acetone, leaving the 100jm central optical region of the fiber end face uncovered.
In contrast, the gold layer deposited directly onto the outer ring region—where no photoresist
mask was present—remains strongly adhered to the fiber surface and is unaffected by the
ultrasonic agitation, as illustrated in Fig. 4(h) and 5(e).

The gold film deposited by magnetron sputtering has a thickness on the order of 100 um,
which is insufficient for use as a dedicated radio-frequency (RF) electrode in the ion trap, as
it is far below the material’s skin depth. At the operating RF frequency of approximately
20 MHz, the skin depth of gold is about 15 zm. When the coating thickness is much smaller
than this value, the effective resistance to the RF current increases substantially, resulting
in pronounced Joule heating within the electrode and, consequently, an elevated ion heating
rate in the trap. To mitigate this effect, the sputtered gold layer is subsequently thickened
by electroplating until its thickness approaches the skin depth, as illustrated in Fig. 4(i) and

Under identical electroplating conditions, multiple samples were prepared. For each sam-
ple, the coating thickness was measured at the upper, middle, and lower sections within a
3cm-long plated region. The metal thickness was determined by subtracting the original
fiber diameter of 240 jum and dividing the difference by two, as summarized in Fig. 5(g). The
results show an average coating thickness of approximately 8 jm with variations below 1 um,
demonstrating excellent thickness uniformity along individual fibers and high reproducibility

across multiple electroplating runs.

of the fiber tips were identified, and four edge lines were fitted to determine the central axis
of each fiber. From the two fitted axes, the positional and angular deviations between the
two fibers were extracted, as illustrated in Fig. 6(b). The analysis shows that the achieved

alignment precision is on the order of 1-2 ym, with a negligible angular deviation.

B. Finesse

In our fabrication process, the fiber cavity mirrors are exposed to various chemical so-
lution, including photoresist, developer solution, acetone, and gold electroplating solution.
Although the outermost layer of the fiber cavity mirror is composed of SiO2, which should
theoretically remain chemically inert to these substances, it cannot be guaranteed that the
mirror finesse remains unaffected after undergoing these treatments. To evaluate this, a

finesse measurement was performed on the fiber sample following gold electroplating, as

14
illustrated in Fig. 6(c). The measurement setup consisted of a flat mirror with identical
coating parameters to the fiber cavity mirror and a one-dimensional piezoelectric transla-
tion stage (PI P-628) for scanning the cavity length [57]. As illustrated in Fig. 6(c), the
finesse remains nearly constant for short cavity lengths. However, when the cavity length
increases to approximately 150 4m, a noticeable degradation in finesse is observed. We
attribute this behavior to the expansion of the optical mode area on the cavity surface at
larger separations, which enhances wavefront distortion losses and consequently reduces the
cavity finesse.

Moreover, in cases where the electroplated fiber end face does not meet the experimental
requirements and re-electroplating is necessary, the previously deposited metal layers must
be completely removed. The gold layer is typically dissolved using aqua regia, while the
underlying titanium adhesion layer is stripped with hot, concentrated hydrochloric acid.
To evaluate the influence of this acid-cleaning process on the fiber cavity performance, we
measured the finesse before and after the procedure, as illustrated in Fig. 6(d). A decrease
in finesse was observed following the acid-cleaning procedure. Specifically, for cavity lengths
below 240m, the average finesse dropped from approximately 10800 to 10400, corresponding
to an increase in optical loss of about 20 ppm. We attribute this degradation primarily to

residual metallic particles on the fiber end face that are difficult to completely remove.

C. Heating Rate

Using the fiber electrodes fabricated through the aforementioned process, we constructed
a needle trap. Stable single-ion trapping was successfully achieved within a fiber cavity
with a cavity length of 230 ym as illustrated in Fig. 7(a), and a temperature measurement
technique based on this system was developed [56]. By measuring the ion temperature
after various delay times of the cooling light, we obtained the relationship between the

phonon number and the cooling-light pause duration, enabling us to quantify the heating

rate of the system. The measured heating rate was 57.62 + 2.09 phonons/ms, as illustrated
in Fig. 7(b). Using our experimental parameters in the previously described heating-rate

simulation yielded a simulated value of 20.65 phonons/ms, which is of the same order of

magnitude as the experimental result.

In the case of a bare fiber cavity with a cavity length of 500 wm, the simulated heating

reduces the heating rate by more than one order of magnitu

de compared to the bare fiber
case and achieves superior performance relative to the metal-tube enclosure method.

V. CONCLUSION

We have demonstrated a fiber-electrode fabrication technique that enables a novel ap-
proach for constructing IFISs. Simulation results demonstrate that this method provides
over two orders of magnitude improvement in suppressing surface currents on the fiber
compared to the conventional approach of enclosing the fiber in a metal tube. Using this
technique, we successfully built an ion trap system integrated with an FFPC and achieved
long-term stable trapping of a single ion. The ion heating rate was subsequently measured,
demonstrating effective shielding of the ion from dielectric-induced heating. Compared with
the unshielded case, our approach reduces the ion heating rate by more than two orders of
magnitude. Furthermore, it outperforms the metal-tube enclosure method. The finesse of
the fiber cavity was characterized before and after the fabrication and acid-cleaning pro-
cesses, confirming that the overall impact of these procedures remains acceptable within a

practical range of cavity lengths.
