Abstract

We review studies on the application of Lie group methods to delay ordinary
differential equations (DODEs). For first- and second-order DODEs with a single
delay parameter that depends on independent and dependent variables, the group
classifications are performed. Classes of invariant DODEs for each Lie subgroup are
written out. The symmetries allow us to construct invariant solutions to such equa-
tions. The application of variational methods to functionals with one delay yields
DODEs with two delays. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches are reviewed.
The delay analog of the Legendre transformation, which relates the Lagrangian and
Hamiltonian approaches, is also analysed. Noether-type operator identities relate
the invariance of delay functionals with the appropriate variational equations and
their conserved quantities. These identities are used to formulate Noether-type the-
orems that give first integrals of second-order DODEs with symmetries. Finally,
several open problems are formulated in the Conclusion.

Keywords: Lie point symmetries, invariance, delay ordinary differential equations, variational
equations, Noether’s theorem, first integrals

Dedication

The paper is dedicated to George Bluman, who made significant contributions to the application
of Lie groups to differential equations. The authors are grateful to him for introducing the use
of the Lagrange operator identity to find conservation laws (first integrals) for non-variational
equations that admit symmetries.
1 Introduction

Since its inception in the classical works of Sophus Lie [1, 2], Lie group analysis has proven to
be a powerful and effective tool for studying both ordinary and partial differential equations.
The Lie group symmetries of a differential equation map solutions to other solutions, enabling
the generation of new solutions from known ones and facilitating the classification of equations
into equivalence classes. Moreover, these symmetries can be used to derive exact analytical
solutions that remain invariant under specific subgroups of the symmetry group, commonly
referred to as group-invariant solutions. ,

The application of Lie group theory to differential equations has been extensively developed
in numerous books and research articles [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Following the seminal contribution of E.
Noether [9], symmetry groups have also served as a fundamental tool for deriving first integrals
and conservation laws in systems with Lagrangian or Hamiltonian formulations. Furthermore,
he connection between symmetry groups and conservation laws for differential equations that
ack a variational structure — hence without an associated Lagrangian or Hamiltonian — was
established in [10, 8].
The application of Lie group transformations has been successfully extended beyond con-
inuous systems to encompass finite-difference, discrete, and differential-difference equations
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] as well as integro-differential equations [23]. In
addition, exact solutions of delay partial differential equations (PDEs) have been investigated
in [24, 25, 26].
The present article reviews the extension of Lie group analysis methods to delay ordinary
differential equations (DODEs). In earlier studies, DODEs with one delay were considered.
A Lie group classification of first-order delay ordinary differential equations was presented
in [27], while linear first-order delay ordinary differential equations were examined in [28].
Furthermore, a Lie group classification of second-order delay ordinary differential equations
was developed in [29]. Results concerning the possible dimensionality of the admitted Lie
algebras were generalized to DODEs of arbitrary order in [30].

A Lagrangian approach to DODEs and a Noether-type theorem for invariant variational
problems were recently presented in [31]. Corresponding results for a Hamiltonian approach to
DODEs were suggested in [32, 33]. We remark that Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms
for difference equations were discussed in [34] (see also [35, 36]).

A variational approach to delay differential equations was introduced long ago in [37, 38,
39, 40, 41]; however, the symmetries of the corresponding variational equations were not inves-
tigated until recently. For simplicity, we restrict our attention to the scalar case, considering
functions involving a single delay, which correspond to two time points: the current time point
t and the delayed time point t— 7, where 7 denotes the delay parameter. Such functionals give
rise to variational delay ordinary differential equations of second order (in terms of the order
of differentiation) that involve two delays: for each time point t, two delayed arguments t — 7
and t — 27 appear. Consequently, the initial data must be specified over an interval of length
Tr

The Noether theorems for variational delay ordinary differential equations represent general-
izations of Noether’s classical theorems for both variational ordinary differential equations and
variational ordinary difference equations. The DODE analogues of Noether’s theorems provide
a systematic method for deriving first integrals directly from the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
functions. When a sufficient number of first integrals is obtained, they can be employed to
construct explicit solutions of the corresponding DODEs.

The structure of the paper is as follows. In the next section, we review results concerning

Q.

Lie group symmetries of DODEs with one delay. Section 3 introduces second-order delay
ordinary differential equations involving two delays. Section 4 presents the application of Lie
point symmetry generators to DODEs. Sections 5 and 6 provide Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
approaches for DODEs. They review the variational equations in the continuous case and their
generalizations for DODEs, invariance of delay functions, and Noether-type theorems. The
final section provides a concise summary of the main results and lists several directions for
future research.

2 Delay ordinary differential equations with one delay

2.1 First-order DODEs

The adaptation of Lie group and Lie algebra theory to the study of delay ordinary differential
equations started in [27, 28]. In these articles, we restricted ourselves to the case of first-
order DODEs, supplemented by a general delay equation. Thus, we consider a delay ordinary
differential system (DODS) of the from

w=f(tuu), tel, oF 29, (2.1a)
Ou_
t_ = g(t,u,u_), t.<4%; g(t, u, u_)Fconst. (2.1b)

Here, J is a finite or semi-finite interval and f and g are arbitrary smooth functions.
Sometimes it is convenient to rewrite (2.1b) in the equivalent form

At=t—t_=4@(t,u,u_), g(t, u, u_) =t— g(t,u,u_).
In most of the existing literature, the delay parameter At is considered to be constant
At=7T > 0, T = const. (2.2)

An alternative is to impose a specific form of the function (2.1b) to include some physical
features of the delay At.

We are interested in group transformations that leave the Eqs. (2.1) invariant (Generators
of Lie group transformations are described in section 4, where DODEs with two delays are
considered). That means that the transformation will transform solutions of the DODS into
other solutions. They leave the set of all solutions invariant. Let us stress that we need to
consider two equations (2.1) together. It makes our approach similar to one of the approaches
for considering symmetries of discrete equations (see, for example, [18]), where invariance is
required for both the discrete equation and the equation specifying the lattice on which it
is considered. Here, we have the DODE (2.1a) instead of a discrete equation and the delay
relation (2.1b) instead of a lattice equation.

The main results were the following:

1. We classified DODSs of the form (2.1) into conjugacy classes under arbitrary Lie point
transformations and found that their Lie point symmetry groups can have dimensions
n=0,1,2,3 or n= oo.

2. The symmetry algebras for genuinely nonlinear DODEs have dimensions n < 3.
3. If n = 00, the DODE is linear and we have a solution-independent delay equation given
by g = g(t), or it can be transformed into this linear form by a point transformation.

4. If the symmetry algebra of a DODS contains a 2-dimensional subalgebra realized by
linearly connected vector fields, then this DODS is linearizable (or already linear with

g = g(t).

5. We presented a method for obtaining particular solutions for DODSs with symmetries.
Exact analytical solutions of invariant DODSs can be obtained using symmetry reduction.

Example 2.1. Let us consider a DODE with a constant delay parameter

. UU
i=
t—t_

+Ciel, t—t.=Cy, Cy > 0. (2.3)

These equations admit symmetries

0 0 0 0

One can easily see that the corresponding Lie group transformations

xX, =

Xi t=") =—4, a=e*1(u) =ute,
Xo: t=e*(t) =t, a= e&*2(u) =utet,
X3: t=e3(t)=t+e, t= e%3(u) =e%u

do not change the form of the DODE, nor the delay relation.
We can find a particular solution of (2.3), which is an invariant solution for the symmetry
X3. It has the form
u= Ae’, t_=t—B, (2.5)
where A and B are constants. This solution form is invariant with respect to the group trans-
formation generated by the symmetry X3. Substituting the form (2.5) into the DODS (2.3),
we obtain the conditions on the constants

CC

~ Gy — 14 e-@’ = Op

Other examples of invariant solutions can be found in [27, 28, 30].

2.2 Second-order DODEs

Second-order delay ordinary differential equations with one delay were examined in [29]. These
DODSs have the form

-  g _ af\? (af?
i= f(t,u,u_,u,u_), tel, (52) + (50) #0, (2.6a)
t_ = g(t, u,u_,u, u_), t.<t; g(t, u, u_, u, u_)#const. (2.6b)

Here f and g are arbitrary smooth functions.

The following results were obtained:
1. A second-order genuinely nonlinear DODS of the type (2.6) can have a Lie point symmetry
algebra of dimension 0 < n < 6 or n = 00

2. Genuinely nonlinear DODEs have symmetry algebras with dimensions n < 6.

3. If we have n = oo, then the DODS is linearisable by an invertible transformation. The
delays of linear DODEs with n = oo are solution-independent, i.e., given by g = g(t).

4. To show that a DODS (2.6) is linearisable (and its delay equation can be brought to the
form g = g(t)), it is sufficient to show that it admits a four-dimensional symmetry algebra
realized by pairwise linearly connected vector fields.

5. Particular solutions of invariant DODSs can be obtained using symmetry reduction.

2.3. Higher order DODEs

In [30], some results obtained for the first- and second-order DODSs in [27, 28, 29] were gen-
eralized for DODEs of arbitrary order with one delay. Such systems of order N have the form

N-1 2
; N- 0
uO) = f(t,u,u_, t,t, ..., uX), uP), tel, : i 40, (2.7a)
ran \OuL
t_=4g(t,u,u_,t,_,...,u%, uh), t.<h, g#const. (2.7b)

The dimension of a symmetry algebra admitted by a DODS of order N can satisfy 0 <
n <2N +2 orn =o. Genuinely nonlinear DODS can admit symmetry algebras of dimension
O0<n<2N+42. Ifn =o, the DODS consists of a linear DODE and a solution-independent
delay relation, or it can be transformed into such a form by an invertible transformation.

For invariant DODSs, we obtained several theoretical results. Namely, if the symmetry
algebra has 2N pairwise linearly connected symmetries, it provides a delay differential system
which can be transformed into a linear DODE supplemented by a solution-independent delay
relation. Such linear DODSs admit infinite-dimensional symmetry groups since they allow
linear superposition of solutions.

3 Delay ordinary differential equations with two delays

In sections 5 and 6, we consider variations of delay functionals with one delay. Such variations
provide delay ordinary differential equations with two delays. In the Lagrangian framework,
we obtain second-order DODEs. For this reason, we describe the second-order DODEs with
two delays.

3.1 Second-order DODEs

Second-order DODEs with two delays have the form

a = F(t*,t,t,ut,uuw wt, , t,t), tel, (3.1a)

tt —t=7, t-t =7, T = const. (3.1b)

ou
where J C Ris some finite or semifinite interval. The independent variable t varies continuously
over the entire region, where Eq. (3.1) is defined!. We emphasize that the delay parameter takes
the same value 7 at all points. It is convenient to use the right and left shift operators, defined
for a function f = f(t,u) as

fF=S.(f)=fltt+rut+r7)), fo =S-(f)=f(t—7,u(t—7)). (3.2)

For example,

tt =S,(t) =t+r7, t =S_@=t-—7r

and
ut = S,(u) =u(t+7), u = S_(u) =u(t—7).

The shifts for first- and second-order derivatives are defined similarly:

at = S,(u) = a(t+7), au = S_(u) =u(t—7),

i* = S,() =i(t+7), 9 ti = S_(t) =ti(t— 7).

In order to provide a DODE with two delays, the function F is required to satisfy

(Ge) + Ge) + Ge) 3)

DODEs (3.1) have to be supplemented by initial conditions. In contrast to the case of
ordinary differential equations, which have initial conditions at a point, initial conditions for
DODE (3.1) are given on an initial interval of length 27, e.g.,

ut)=~t), wt)h=9%), wWth=(t),  té€ [to—7,% +7]. (3.4)

For simplicity, we assume that the function y(t) is twice differentiable on the interval [to —
7, to +7], although this requirement can be relaxed. One of the procedures for solving DODEs
either analytically or numerically is called the method of steps [39].

3.2 First integrals of DODEs

A DODE (3.1) may contain a dependent variable and its derivatives at three points ¢*, t,
and t-. Two types of conserved quantities can be introduced: differential first integrals and
difference first integrals.

Definition 3.1. A quantity
I(t*,t,t°,ut,u,u, a7, a, a) (3.5)
is called a differential first integral of DODE (8.1) if it holds constant on solutions of the DODE.
The differential first integral (3.5) satisfies the equation
DD =l++ht+h-+het* + hit h-w + lst? + Ini t+ [y-ti =0, (3.6)

which should hold for any solution of the considered DODE (3.1).
In addition to the differential first integral, one can define a difference integral.

ln the literature on DODEs with two delays, it is standard to consider three points t, t — 7, and t — 2r.
We prefer to use three points t* =t+7T, t, and t =t—T, as this choice is more suitable for variational delay
equations.
Definition 3.2. Quantity
Jit yu tye t,t) Gx)

is called a difference first integral of DODE (3.1) if satisfies the equation
(S,-1)J =0 (3.8)
on the solutions of the DODE.
We illustrate the definitions of the first integrals with a simple example.

Example 3.1. The DODE

has the differential first integral
T= -w

and the difference first integral
J=U-U.

©
The differential first integral is constant on DODE solutions. In contrast, the difference first

integral need not be constant on DODE solutions: it can be a periodic function with period 7,
where 7 is the delay parameter.

4 Lie point symmetries and invariant DODEs

4.1 Lie point symmetries

Consider an infinitesimal transformation group
tot =f(t,u,a) +t+ &(t,uja, uru =g(t,u,a) y ut nt, ua, (4.1)

where a is the group parameter. Such transformations are represented by a generator in the
standard form [3]:
&(t ae (t dan (4.2)
X = u)— + n(t, u fee .
’ 1 Ke,

U
For group analysis of second-order DODE with two delays (3.1), generators should be pro-
longed to all variables included in the DODE: derivatives uw and tu, and variables at shifted
points (t",u7,u~, tu) and (tt, u*, ut, ii”). This leads to

provides the total derivative.

4.2 The invariance of DODEs

To consider invariant DODEs (3.1a) with a constant delay (3.1b), we require both equations
(3.1a) and (3.1b) to be invariant together.

In the present paper, we restrict the function € to depend on t only: € = €(t). In this
case, one can single out the invariance condition for system (3.la) and (3.1b), and consider
the invariance of the equations separately. The infinitesimal criterion for the invariance of an
equation (3.1a) becomes

X(ii* — F)| =0, (4.5)

ut+=F, t+}—t=t—t—

for the prolonged generators (4.3).
For an arbitrary t, the delay parameter 7 is assumed to have the same value to the right
and left of t:
tt—-t=t—t =r. (4.6)

We need this relation to be preserved under group transformations, i-e.,
(tt)*}-t=t-(t)t=r7*.
This leads to the infinitesimal condition
E(t") — &(t) = €(t) — &(t).
The latter equation has the following solution:
E(t) = ft + gb), (4.7)

where f(¢) and g(t) are arbitrary periodic functions with the period 7. Notice that this solution
allows the delay parameter to be changed.

The next requirement for a transformation of a delay is that after the transformation, the
time scale should remain unchanged.
To keep time homogeneity of transformations, we have to preserve the following relation for
pairwise distinguished points ty, ta, ts, ta:

t, — te = (ts — ta), (4.8)
where ¥ is constant. Applying generator (4.2), one gets
(E(t1) — &(t2) — (E(ts) — €(t4))) [as = 9.
Satisfying this condition, one obtains the following result:
E(t) =at+ £B, (4.9)

where a and £ are arbitrary constants.
Notice that (4.9) is not required for all results obtained below: some of the requirements
can be relaxed.

5 Lagrangian approach for DODEs

This section describes the Lagrangian approach to delay ordinary differential equations and
provides the Noether theorem, established in [31].

5.1 ODE case: the Euler-Lagrange equation

It is well known [42, 43, 44, 45, 46] that variations of the action functional

b
L= / L(t,u, ts) dt, (5.1)
where L(t, u, t) is a Lagrangian function, lead to the Euler-Lagrange equation

oL OL OL
ju Ou B (5) = 9, (5.2)

where

p=" pg” free
a du Oa

is the total differentiation operator. We consider a one-dimensional case u € R for simplicity.
Remark 5.1. In the case of ODEs, the variational equations corresponding to variations of

the dependent and independent variables are equivalent. For the first-order Lagrangians L =
L(t,u,t), these equations are the Euler-Lagrange equation (5.2) and the Du Bois-Reymond

equation
oL OL OL
+ D {a L :

respectively. It is not difficult to check that these equations are proportional
OL oL
= yy 4
it Ou’ 4)

and, therefore, equivalent.
5.2 Variational equations for delay functionals

Consider a first-order functional with one constant delay

b
c= f L(t,t7,u,u-, t, uw )dt (5.5a)

t-t =7, T = const. (5.5b)
and the Lagrangian function L satisfying

Let the interval [t1,¢2] be such that a < ti < t2 < b—7. We apply slight perturbations of
the independent and dependent variables given by

t-=t+o(t)e, ue=utd(te, t<t<t, (5.7)
where y(t) and 2)(t) are differentiable functions satisfying
p(s) =0 and w(s)=0 for 8 € (—00, ty] U [t2, 00) (5.8)

and ¢ is a small parameter. Such perturbations produce variations of the derivative w and the
differential dt. The variational equations were derived in [31].
For y = 0 and w 4 0, we obtain the extremal delay equation

+ +
dL OL , aL p(% abt) <9

du Ou Ou Ou + Ou (5.9)

which represents the ‘vertical variation’, i.e., a variational equation for the variation of the

dependent variable u. This equation is known since Elsgolts [39] (see also (37, 38]). We call it
the Elsgolts equation.
For the case yp # 0 and 7 = 0, we define a ‘horizontal variation’
6L OL OLt OL .dLt
Dit + ub L}) =0. 5.
i Ob Ot (Wri ) 0 0)

For variations defined by the symmetry (4.2), we multiply the coefficients of the generator

X by a function y(t) satisfying (5.8)
te =t+ y(tE(t, ue, Ue = ut v(t)n(t, ue. 5.11)

In this case, the variation leads to the equation

aL aLt OL alt fab, abt aL att
aE oT D(age + Ou t)| aE Ou Dai al =9,

which depends explicitly on € and », i.e., on the considered given group. It can be rewritten in
the form
oL OL

We call this equation the local extremal equation. Notice that a local extremal equation is a
second-order DODE containing L and the shifted to the right Lagrangian L*, and by virtue
of the equation has two delays. The local extremal equation gives the necessary condition for
any Lagrangian to achieve an extremal value for variations along orbits of the considered Lie
group.

Remark 5.2. In contrast to the ODE case (see remark 5.1), the vertical variational equation
(5.9) and the horizontal variational equation (5.10) are not equivalent.

5.3 Invariance of delay functionals

Invariance of first-order functional with one delay for a one-parameter group of point transfor-
mations (4.1) was examined in [31]. It was shown that it is equivalent to the invariance of the
elementary action

L(t,t,uu,t,u )dt = Lf, f-,9.9°.9,.9 )D(f)dt. (5.14)

Thus, the functional is invariant if and only if the elementary action is invariant. It leads to
the criterion for invariance of the delay functional.

Theorem 5.3. (Invariance of Lagrangian) The functional (5.5) is invariant with respect to
the group of transformations with the generator (4.2) if and only if

XL+LD(€) =0. (5.15)

In detail, the invariance condition (5.15) states

dL dL aL _dL  .aL aL 7
So tS ae tag t aa tS GG tS age t LPO) = 0. (18)

5.4 Noether’s identity and Noether-type theorem

In this subsection, we introduce the Noether operator identity, which relates the invariance of
a Lagrangian (5.15), a local extremal equation (5.12), and conserved quantities.

Lemma 5.4. (Noether’s identity) The following identity holds

oL OL
XL+LD(é) =£— +n— + D(C’) + (1-$,)C7, 5.17)
ot ou
where ee
C=€L+(n-ué) (5 + Da ) 5.18)
and aL aL. aL
P Cae tn a4 G1 a 5.19)

Direct computations prove the identity. It yields various versions of the Noether theorem
for delay differential equations. We recall that invariance of the delay functional (5.15) does
not require invariance of the delay equation (3.1b).

Theorem 5.5. (Noether’s theorem) Let a delay functional (5.5) be invariant for the group
action corresponding to the generator (4.2) on solutions of the local extremal equation

oL oL .
—_ =0. 2
gts = 9 (5.20)
Then the differential-difference relation
D(C) = (Sy —1)P (5.21)

holds on solutions of this equation.

11
Proof. The result follows from identity (5.17).

Theorem 5.5 has an extension for the divergence invariant Lagrangians. Such an extension
for the Noether theorem was first proposed in [47].

Corollary 5.6. Let delay functional (5.5) satisfy the condition
XL+LD(é) = D(V)+ (1— 54)W (5.22)

with some functions V (tt,t,t~,u*,u,u-,u*, uu) andW(t,t-,u,u-, t, a, ti, WU) on solutions
of the local extremal equation (5.20). Then the differential-difference relation

D(C -V) = (S,-1D(P-W) (5.23)
holds on solutions of this equation.

Condition (5.22) means the divergent invariance of the Lagrangian. We call the terms on
the right side, namely D(V) and (1—S)W, as differential divergence and difference divergence,
respectively.

For some DODE, the differential-difference relation (5.21) can be converted into a differential
first integral or a difference first integral.

Corollary 5.7. If there holds
(S,-—1)P = D(V) 5.24)
with some function V (t*,t,t-,u*,u,u-,u*,u,u), then the differential-difference relation (5.21)
provides the differential first integral
[=C-V. 5.25)
Corollary 5.8. If there holds
D(C) = (S$, -1)W, 5.26)

with some function W(t,t-,u,u-,t,u, t,t), then the differential-difference relation (5.21)
provides the difference first integral

J=P-W. 5.27)

5.5 Example: delay oscillator

In this example, we illustrate the basic version of Noether’s Theorem 5.5, its corollary, and how
to transform differential-difference relations into differential first integrals.
Consider the Lagrangian function

L= tt — uu (5.28)
and the symmetries
(a) _,¢ (a) 0
Ky = costa, X2 sinta X3 ve Xy = uae (5.29)

The symmetries X, and X2 are linearly connected. For them, the local extremal equation
(5.20) is the Elsgolts equation

bL
ou

i —i* =0. (5.30)
The symmetry Xj satisfies the divergence invariance condition (5.22)

X,L+LD(é,;) = D(—sint-u-—sint uw").

Therefore, the differential-difference relation (5.23) with

C, =cost(i* + a7) +sint-ut+sintu, Pi =—cost-u—sint wu
holds on solutions of equation (5.30). Using Corollary 5.7 and
(S, —1)P, = D(-sint ut +sint~u),

we find the differential first integral

I, =cost(u* +a) +sint(u* +u7). (5.31)
For the symmetry X2, the divergence invariance condition is
XL + LD(&) = D(cost-u + cost uw).

The components of the differential-difference relation are

Cy = sint(u* + a7) — cost-u—cost w, P,=-—sint-u+cost wu.

Using
($4 — 1) Py = D(cost u* — cost~u),

we transform the differential-difference relation into the differential first integral
In =sint(u* +t) —cost(u* +u7). (5.32)

For the symmetry X3, we get the horizontal variational equation

oL
== Dit + wu7) = tet + wit + tu + ut = 0. (5.33)

Notice that equation (5.30) is linear, while equation (5.33) is nonlinear.
The symmetry X3 is variational, i.e., it satisfies

X3L + LD(&) = 0.
It leads to the differential-difference relation (5.21) with
C3 = —Wu* — uw, P3=0.
This relation is actually the differential first integral
T3 = C3 = —tit — uu, (5.34)

which holds on solutions of the horizontal variational equation (5.33).

We note that the symmetries X, and X2 give the first integrals I; and Jy for the Elsholtz
equation. In contrast, the symmetry X3 gives the first integral J3 for the horizontal variational
equation (5.33): the first integral J; does not hold on solutions of the Elsgolts equation (5.30).

13
Variational equations can admit symmetries that are neither variational nor divergence
symmetries of the Lagrangians. For example, both equations (5.30) and (5.33) are invariant
with respect to the scaling of the dependent variable, which is represented by the generator X4,
while this symmetry is not admitted by the Lagrangian (5.28):

XiL + LD(&s) = 20,

where the right-hand side 2L can not be presented as a divergence.

The differential first integrals J; and Iz can be used to provide solutions of equation (5.30).
Setting them equal to constants

we get
ut +u- = Asint — Beost.
The above general solution can be used to obtain a solution of an initial-value problem by
means of just algebraic manipulation. For convenience, we rewrite this relation in the shifted
form

u(t) + u(t — 27) = Asin(t — r) — Bcos(t —T). (5.35)
We start with the initial values
u(t) = y(t), t € [—2r, 0].

For simplicity, we assume that the function y(t) has a continuous first derivative on this interval.
The initial conditions give

A= (0)+9(-27),  B=—y(0)— ¢(-2r).
Using (5.35), we obtain

u(t) = Asin(t — rT) — Bcos(t — Tr) — y(t — 2r), t € [0, 27];

u(t) = Asin(t — 7) — Bcos(t — rT) — u(t — 27)
= Asin(t — rT) — Bcos(t — r) — Asin(t — 37) + Bcos(t — 37) + y(t — 47), t € [2r, 47];

and so on. By virtue of these relations, one can find the solution u(t), t € [7, oo) recursively,
starting from the initial data. In contrast to the method of steps [39], this recursive procedure
does not require any integration.

6 Hamiltonian approach for DODEs

The Hamiltonian approach to delay ordinary differential equations was developed in [33]. It is
related to the Lagrangian approach via a delay analog of the Legendre transformation.

14
6.1 ODE case: the canonical Hamiltonian equations

We shortly overview the variational approach for canonical Hamiltonian ODEs in the case of
scalar dependent functions g(t) and p(t). Similarly, we will construct a Hamiltonian approach
for DODEs.

We consider the canonical Hamiltonian equations [44, 45]

(6.1)

for some Hamiltonian function H = H(t,q,p). These equations can be obtained by the varia-
tional principle in the phase space (q, p) from the action functional

t= / (pj — H(t,q,p)) at (6.2)

(see, for example, [42]).
Let us note that the canonical Hamiltonian equations (6.1) can be obtained by the action
of the variational operators

on the integrand of the functional (6.2), namely on the function

H = pq — H(t,4,p). (6.3)
In detail, we obtain . _

Remark 6.1. We can also consider the variation with respect to the independent variable t

This equation holds on the solutions of the canonical Hamiltonian equations (6.1):
OH OH OH OH

G=Hp, p=-Hg

The relationship of the Hamiltonian function H(t, q, p) with the Lagrangian function L(t, q, g)
is given by the Legendre transformation

where we should substitute ¢ expressed from

a) (6.7)

15
in the right-hand side [42]. Equation (6.7) can be resolved for g if es #0.

The Legendre relation (6.6) makes it possible to establish equivalence of Euler-Lagrange
equation (5.2) and canonical Hamiltonian equations (6.1) (see, for example, [45]). In addition
to the relation (6.7), there hold

. OH OH OL OH OL
d= a = (6.8)

Lie point symmetries of canonical Hamiltonian equations (6.1) are given by the generators

of the form

(a) (a) (a)
X= S(t GP) a, + n(t, @P)a, + uta Paes (6.9)

which are prolonged to the derivatives according to the standard prolongation formulas [3, 4, 5).

Remark 6.2. Jt should be noticed that the Legendre transformation (6.6) is not a point trans-
formation. Hence, there is no one-to-one correspondence between Lie point symmetries of the
Euler-Lagrange equation (5.2), which are given by the generators of the form (4.2), and Lie
point symmetries of the canonical Hamiltonian equations, which are presented by the generators
of the form (6.9).

6.2 Variational equations for delay functionals

Similarly to the continuous case, one can consider a delay analog of the functional (6.2). We
introduce the Hamiltonian functional with one delay

b
H -{ Pp (ardg + agdg”) + p(asdg + agdg”) — H(t,t”, 4,0 ,p,p ) dt, (6.10a)
t-t =7, T = const. (6.10b)

where a;, 7 = 1,2,3,4 are some constants. One can consider more complicated cases of the
coefficients a;. Nonconstant a; are treated in [32].

For the variations of the dependent variables p and q and the independent variable t taken
on the interval [a.b — rT], we obtain equations

oH . . _ oO
tp =aig* + (a2 +a3)¢ + aug” — apt +) =0, (6.11a)

where .

is the function corresponding to the integrand of functional (6.10a). Here, the operator of total
differentiation D is
(a) 0 (a) 0 0 0 (a) 0 0

D + G=- + p> +4 fe aes yt Lit

The first and second operators perform the ‘vertical variations’ (i-e., the variations with respect
to the dependent variables p and q), the last one takes the ’horizontal variation’ (the variation
with respect to the independent variable t).

16
Remark 6.3. In contrast to the canonical Hamiltonian ODEs (see Remark 6.1), the equa-
tion (6.11c) does not hold on the solutions of the equations (6.11a) and (6.11b), supplemented
by the delay equation (3.1b).

For the variations along group orbits corresponding to the generator (6.9), we obtain the
variational equation
sa bt ott
E yt i v ip 0. (6.13)
This local extremal equation is the Hamiltonian analog of (5.13).
We consider the system of equations

given by (6.11a) and (6.11b) as the delay canonical Hamiltonian equations, i.e., the delay analog
of the canonical Hamiltonian equations (6.1). Shortly, they can be presented as

oH oH
=0

ipo qn (6.15)

These equations are first-order DODEs with two delays. They are supplemented by the delay
equation (3.1b). Note that all three variational equations (6.11) supplemented by the delay
equation (3.1b) form an overdetermined system.

6.3 Compatibility of Hamiltonian approach with Lagrangian ap-
proach

In the classical Hamiltonian theory (see, for example, [42]), the variables q and p are named
canonical if the system of equations for them is equivalent to the Euler-Lagrange variational
equation. We are following the same strategy for the delay Hamiltonian equations and consid-
ering the transition from the Lagrangian to the Hamiltonian approach via a delay version of
the Legendre transformation.

6.3.1 Delay Legendre transformation

We consider the delay analog of the Legendre transformation
A(t,t-.¢,0 .p.p) =p (org + a2g7) + plasg + aug”) — L7G); (6.16)

where g and q- in the right-hand side are to be substituted as found from

We also obtain relations

17
and dH aL OH ALS OH—SOAL.~—sOH sO 619
Og Oq’ Oqr Oq-’ ot ot’ Ot Ot (6.19)

We are interested in delay canonical Hamiltonian equations (6.14), which correspond to
Elsgolts equation (5.9). Starting with a delay Lagrangian L, we obtain the corresponding delay
Hamiltonian H. The delay Legendre transformation (6.16) gives the correspondence between
the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian. We impose a compatibility condition’, which requires
that the variables p and p~ expressed from the Legendre transformation via the variables g and

q” satisfy

p=S,(p). (6.20)

6.3.2 Delay Legendre transformation with compatibility condition
We consider Lagrangians to be quadratic in the derivatives. Namely, the Lagrangians of the
form © ¥

L=5¢+64¢ +357) - 64.7), (6.21)
where a, 6 # 0, and y are some constants (a more general form of Lagrangians is examined
in [32]). The Elsgolts variational equation for this Lagrangian takes the form

OL

0
%q 77 Ga + (a+ G+ bE + aq? + *) =0. (6.22)

It was shown in [33] that the compatibility condition (6.20) holds for coefficient

Og = a a3 = an, a4 =a, #0. (6.23)
b

For these coefficients, we obtain
p= a p=—q. (6.24)

The Hamiltonian given by (6.16) takes the form

2
= 1 (2 Bay 4 Ul y-)2 -
H= BR (Sp + Bop” + 5(p ) +ola.4 ). (6.25)

For this Hamiltonian, the delay Hamiltonian equations (6.14) with the coefficients (6.23) can
be presented as

. aty. ae a+ _
ay (a+ G44 ) =— (w+ 5 tp +p ). (6.26a)
a Ot. O
an Gi B TH+p ) = aq et #)- (6.26b)

They provide a decomposition of the second-order Elsgolts equation (6.22) into two first-order
DODEs with two delays. A convenient choice a; = { simplifies the relations (6.24), the
Hamiltonian (6.25), and the delay canonical Hamiltonian equations (6.26).

?Imposing this condition, we avoid contradiction with the Legendre relations in a given point with that in a
shifted point, and avoid introducing a double set of variables p as it was done in [48].

18
6.4 Invariance of delay functionals

In section 4, we introduced Lie point symmetries for the Lagrangian approach. Here, we modify
them to the Hamiltonian case. Let group transformations in the space (t,¢q,p) be provided by
generators of the form (6.9). To apply the generator (6.9) to delay Hamiltonian equations, we
prolong it to all variables involved, namely derivatives q and p, and variables at the shifted
points (t",q-,p-,q-,p_) and (t*,q*, pt, q@*, pt). We obtain the prolonged operator

where
€=€(t,4,D), n= 7(t,4,P) v= v(t, 4q,p).
The coefficients

on = Sot, 4.2; B) = D(n)-GD(E), GW = Gta, 2, Bb) = Dv) — pD(E),

are found according to the standard prolongation formulas [3, 4, 5]. The other coefficients are
obtained by the left and right shift operators S_ and S_:

6 =S(8, 7 =S(n), =S), G=S-G) G = SAG),

f=S(8), nt =Si(m), vr =S,(v), Ge =S(G), OF = S4(G)-
The left and right shift operators S_ and $4 are defined in (3.2).
As in the Lagrangian approach, the invariance of a delay functional is equivalent to the
invariance of the corresponding elementary action. We go directly to the result.

Theorem 6.4. (Invariance of delay Hamiltonian) The functional (6.2) is invariant with
respect to the group transformations with the generator (6.9) if and only if

X(H) + HD(€)

6.5 First integrals of delay Hamiltonian equations

We adopt the form of first integrals, introduced in subsection 3.2, to delay canonical Hamilto-
nian equations. The delay Hamiltonian equations can contain the dependent variables at three
points: ¢*, t, and t~. There can be two types of conserved quantities: differential first integrals
and difference first integrals.

Definition 6.5. Quantity

T(t*,t.0°,0°.4,0 PPP ) (6.29)
is called a differential first integral of the delay Hamiltonian equations if it is constant on the
solutions of the delay Hamiltonian equations.

19
We require that the differential first integrals (6.29) satisfy the equation
DD =let+tht+h-+leG@ +hat+h-¥ +1+p + hp+h-p =0, (6.30)

which should hold on the solutions of the considered delay Hamiltonian equations.
In addition to differential first integrals, we can define difference first integrals.

Definition 6.6. Quantity
J(tt.7 PP 47 Pd ) (6.31)
is called a difference first integral of the delay Hamiltonian equations if it satisfies the equation

(5, —1)J =0 (6.32)

on the solutions of the delay Hamiltonian equations.

6.6 Hamiltonian identity and Noether-type theorem

Noether-type theorems are formulated based on Hamiltonian identity, which is a Hamiltonian
version of the Noether operator identity used in the Lagrangian approach.

Lemma 6.7. (Hamiltonian identity) The following identity holds
ma oH . oH . 6H
X(H)+ HD(é) = + 1 D + (1 PB. .
(H) (Sey +n ig +’ ap t (C) + (1 — Sy)P, (6.33)

where the variations >, ay and = are given in (6.11),

C = nlaap* + (a2 + a3)p + arp) — €(a2(pg — pg) + aa(p'¢ — pg) + A),
and

OH OH _OH

pe Tae” ap

P= (agp +aup)D(y") + (arg + a2g7) — (aap™ + aup)g” D(E~) — €

Based on the Hamiltonian identity, the most general Noether-type theorem is formulated
as follows.

Theorem 6.8. (Noether’s theorem) Let a Hamiltonian with some given constants a1, Q2,
ag and ag be invariant with respect to a one-parameter group of transformations with a gener-
ator (6.9), i.e. condition (6.28) hold. Then, on the solutions of the local extremal equation
6H 6H 6H
0 6.34
oR ty tap (6.34)

there holds the differential-difference relation

D(C) = (8, —1)P. (6.35)

Proof. The proof follows from the Hamiltonian identity (6.33).

For Noether’s theorem, it is convenient to generalize the invariance of a delay Hamilto-
nian (6.28) and consider divergence invariance [47].

20
Definition 6.9. The delay Hamiltonian H(t,t~,q,q-,p,p_) is called divergence invariant for
a generator (6.9) if instead of the condition (6.28) it satisfies the condition

X (A) + HD(€) = D(V) + (1— S4)W (6.36)

with some functions V(t*,t,t-,q*,4,¢°.p*.p,p_) and W(t,t-,4,.0° PP 54,4 +B. P ) on so-
lutions of local extremal equation (6.34).

Corollary 6.10. Let delay Hamiltonian functional (6.10a) satisfy divergence invariance (6.36).
Then, on solutions of the local extremal equation (6.34) there holds the differential-difference
relation

D(C -—V) = (S;—1)(P-W). (6.37)
Based on the Noether Theorem 6.8, it is possible to provide specified results.

Corollary 6.11. If the difference in the differential-difference relation (6.35) can be presented
as a total derivative, 1.e.
(S,-—1)P = D(V) 6.38)

with some function V(t*,t,t~,q*,¢,¢°,P',P,p_), then there holds the differential first integral
I=C-YV. 6.39)

Corollary 6.12. If the total derivative in the differential-difference relation (6.35) can be pre-
sented as a difference, i.e.
D(C) = (S, -— IW, 6.40)

with some function W(t,t-,¢,¢°.D,.P .44>4 7), then, there is the difference first integral
J=P-W. 6.41)

6.6.1 Delay canonical Hamiltonian equations

The system of local extremal equation (6.13) and delay parameter equation (3.1b) is underde-
termined. There are several ways to choose a determined system. The most important choice
is to consider the delay canonical Hamiltonian equations.

Proposition 6.13. The results of the Theorem 6.8 hold for symmetries (6.9) with € = 0 and
the delay canonical Hamiltonian equations (6.14) with constant delay (3.1b).

6.7 Example: delay oscillator

We consider the Lagrangian

Ltt .40°47 )=@ -W- 6.42)
It yields the Elsgolts equation
Fa +e tat ee) = 0. 6.43)
Following (6.23), we take
a =1, a2 = 0, a3 = 0, 4 = 1. 6.44)

21
For these coefficients, the relations (6.24) take the form
P=4 Pp =q.

We obtain the Hamiltonian function

H=pqtpg -L=p4qt+pd -—4¢ +99 =pp +a (6.45)
and the delay canonical Hamiltonian equations

g+q =ptt+p, (6.46a)

p+p =-¢ -¢. (6.46b)

We consider these equations with the delay equation (3.1b). One can easily verify that these
Hamiltonian equations are equivalent to the Elsgolts equation (6.43).

For Hamiltonian (6.45) and coefficients (6.44), we obtain

H=pqt+p¢ —H=p-q+py — pp -— 4"

Delay equations (6.46) admit symmetry operators

te) (a) a)
X, =sint + cost —, X» = cost sint

aq ap dq Op’
to) (a) (a) (a) (a)
at’ X4 14 y Pap’ X5 Pag tap"

X3

(6.47)

We note that symmetry X; has no corresponding Lie point symmetry in the Lagrangian ap-
proach.
For symmetry X,, the Hamiltonian is divergence invariant

X,(A) + HD(,) = D(cost-q + cost q7).
The symmetry gives the differential-difference relation
D(sint (pt + p_) — cost’ q — cost q_) = (S; — 1)(cost-q — sint”q).
Since the right-hand side of the differential-difference relation can be rewritten as a total deriva-

tive
(9, — 1)(cost7q — sint~q) = D(cost g* — cost” q),

we obtain the differential integral

I, =sint (pt +p-)—cost (q7 +). (6.48)

Symmetry Xp» also satisfies divergence invariance of the Hamiltonian
X,(H) + HD(é:) = D(—sint-q-—sint -).

We obtain the differential-difference relation

D(cost (pt +p~) +sint-q+sint q-) = ($4 —1)(—sintq — cost7q).

22
Rewriting the right-hand side of the differential-difference relation as the total derivative

(S, —1)(—sint~q —cost~q) = D(—sint qt +sint~q),
we obtain the differential integral
In = cost (p* +p-)+sint (q7 +). (6.49)
Thought symmetry X3 is a variational symmetry of the Hamiltonian, i.e.,
X3(H) + HD(&) = 0,

It needs other equations than the canonical Hamiltonian equation (6.46) ,(3.1b) for deriving the
differential-difference relation.
For symmetry X4, we find

Xa(H) + HD(&s) = 2(p-¢ + pd — pp — 47°).

The symmetry is neither variational symmetry nor divergence symmetry of the Hamiltonian.
Thus, there is no differential-difference relation.
Symmetry X; is a divergence symmetry of the Hamiltonian

X5(H) + HD(és) = D(pp- — aq).

It provides the differential-difference relation

D(pp* + 49°) = (Si - 1) (pp — 4 - +P).
Converting this relation to a differential or difference first integral is not possible.

The differential first integrals J; and Jy can be used to find solutions to the delay Hamiltonian
equations (6.46). In fact, setting the values of these first integrals as

IL=A, In = B,
where A and B are constant, we obtain the following solution

gq’ +q =—Acost + Bsint, (6.50a)
p’ +p. = Asint + Bost. (6.50b)

Using this representation, one can construct a solution to a Cauchy problem with the initial
values

at) =9(t), = pt)=%@), = t€ [27,0],
where the functions y(t) and 7(¢) are assumed to be continuous. By rewriting relations (6.50)
in shifted form

q(t) + q(t — 27) Acos(t — 7) + Bsin(t — 1), (6.51a)
p(t) + p(t — 27) = Asin(t — r) + Bcos(t — 7), (6.51b)

we find the constants A and B as
A= —cosr (p(0) + y(—2r)) — sin t (b(0) + (-27)),

23
B= -—sinr (y(0) + y(—2r)) + cost ((0) + (—27)).
Applying relations (6.51), we derive the solution of the Cauchy problem for ¢ € [0, 27]

q(t) p(t — 27) — Acos(t — rT) + Bsin(t — 7),

p(t) w(t — 27) + Asin(t — 7) + Bcos(t — Tr).
Then, for t € [27, 47]

q(t) = p(t — 47) + Acos(t — 3r) — Bsin(t — 37) — Acos(t — r) + Bsin(t — 7),

p(t) = W(t — 4r) — Asin(t — 37) — Bcos(t — 3r) + Asin(t — rT) + Bcos(t — Tr).

This process can be continued recursively. Using these relations, one can find the solution
(q(t), p(t)) for t € [0,00). Unlike the standard method of solving DODEs, namely the method
of steps [39], which requires integration, the recursive procedure outlined above does not involve
any integration.

7 Concluding remarks

This paper provides a review of research on the application of Lie group transformations to
delay ordinary differential equations.

First, DODEs of first- and second-order DODEs with a single delay were classified into
conjugacy classes, under arbitrary Lie point transformations. Here, we examine the invariance
of a system of two equations: the DODE itself and the equation specifying a delay. The method
for obtaining particular solutions of DODEs by symmetry reduction was presented.

Then, the Lagrangian approach for variational delay ordinary differential equations is pre-
sented for first-order delay Lagrangians. The variational approach to constructing DODEs
necessarily leads to equations with two delays. Noether-type operator identity relates the in-
variance of a delay functional with the appropriate variational equations and their conserved
quantities. This identity is used to state a Noether-type theorem that gives first integrals of
variational second-order DODEs with symmetries.

Finally, the Hamiltonian approach to delay differential equations is described. The de-
lay analog of the Legendre transformation, which relates the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
approaches, is discussed. This transformation possesses several coefficients that should be ap-
propriately related to the form of the Lagrangian. The transition from a Lagrangian function
to the corresponding Hamiltonian function has been demonstrated for Lagrangians that are
quadratic in the derivatives. The delay analog of the Hamiltonian operator identity, which
relates the invariance of a delay functional with the appropriate variational equations and their
conserved quantities, is established. The Noether-type theorem was derived from this identity.
In particular, it holds for delay canonical Hamiltonian equations with constant delay, with
symmetries acting in the space of the dependent variables.

For both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches, first integrals can be used to express
solutions. In cases of sufficiently many first integrals, the solutions of the DODEs can be
presented recursively.

In the paper, we did not explain how the invariance of variational equations relates to the
invariance of delay functionals. This topic was considered for the Lagrangian approach in [31]
and for the Hamiltonian approach in [33].

In conclusion, we formulate a range of problems that still await solution.

S. Lee formulated an algorithm for the complete integration of second-order ODEs with
two or more symmetries [49]. It would be tempting to develop a similar method for
second-order DODEs with the required number of symmetries.

. The so-called direct method, which allows finding conservation laws (first integrals) of

differential equations without using symmetries, has been significantly developed in works
[10, 50, 8]. It would be tempting to generalize this method to differential equations with
retarded arguments.

. The adjoint equation method, based on the Lagrange operator identity, allows one to

find conservation laws (first integrals) of differential equations, regardless of whether a
variational formulation exists for these equations. The works of G. Bluman and S. Anko
[51, 52, 8] made significant contributions to this method. This method has been success-
fully generalized to ordinary difference equations [21]. Hopefully, it can be generalized to
DODEs.

. The variational approach to constructing equations with delay inevitably leads to equa-

tions with two (or more) delay parameters. However, a group classification of differential
equations with two delay parameters has not yet been completed. This task is difficult
even for DODEs with constant delay parameters, as many variables appear in the equa-
tion’s description. This problem becomes even more complicated if the classification is
carried out under the assumption that the delay parameter may depend on the solution.

. In practical problems involving mathematical models with a delay argument (e.g., chem-

istry, biology, etc.), equations with a single constant delay parameter are most often used.
However, these models are not derived from the assumption of any conserved quantities
or integrals. Meanwhile, modeling processes based on delay conservation laws may yield
equations with two delay parameters and the possibility of variational formulations.
