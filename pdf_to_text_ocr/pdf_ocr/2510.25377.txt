We show that weakly nonreciprocal alignment leads to large-scale structure formation in flocking
mixtures. By combining numerical simulations of a binary Vicsek model and the analysis of coarse-
grained continuum equations, we demonstrate that nonreciprocity destabilizes the ordered phase
formed by mutually aligning or anti-aligning species in a large part of the phase diagram. For

that it is generic to nonreciprocal flocks.

In recent years, nonreciprocal interactions have been
recognized as an essential feature of systems that evolve
far from equilibrium, such as active matter [1-3]. Non-
reciprocity is particularly relevant to describe biologi-
cal populations competing for resources through complex
social interactions [2, 4, 5], while it arises naturally in
simpler contexts, including chemotactic mixtures [6-12]
and heterogeneous populations of robots [13] or colloidal
rollers [14]. One of the most spectacular consequences
of nonreciprocity is the emergence of collectively induced
dynamical states [15-17].

Since the seminal works of Vicsek et al. [18], Toner
and Tu [19, 20], the study of flocking agents has become
a paradigmatic example of active matter [21, 22]. Nonre-
ciprocity can be introduced into flocking models by lim-
iting the particles’ range of perception, so that they in-
teract, e.g., mainly with neighbors in front of them. This
geometric nonreciprocity significantly affects the collec-
tive behavior of flocks, leading to the formation of struc-
tures such as condensates [23], lanes, or vortex states [24—
26]. Another natural way in which nonreciprocity arises
is when heterogeneous populations interact asymmetri-
cally [13, 17, 27-35]. In this case, nonreciprocity can
induce dynamical chiral states through the crossing of
exceptional points [17, 31, 36]. Importantly, such col-
lective behaviors require strongly nonreciprocal interac-
tions, resulting in antisymmetric couplings between the
two populations.

In this Letter, we focus on a comparatively less ex-
plored regime, and investigate the fate of flocks sub-
jected to weak population nonreciprocity. Considering
a Vicsek model (VM) of two populations that mutu-
ally align or anti-align their velocities, we demonstrate
that nonreciprocal interactions generally induce large-
scale structure formation associated with the demixing

aligning populations, this instability results in one species condensing in a single band that travels
within a homogeneous liquid of the other species. When interactions are anti-aligning, both species
self-assemble into polar clusters with large-scale chaotic dynamics. In both cases, the emergence
of structures is accompanied by the demixing of the two species, despite the absence of repulsive
interactions. Our theoretical analysis allows us to elucidate the origin of the instability, and show

of the two species. Unlike in previous studies, the mech-
anism underlying demixing solely relies on nonreciprocal
alignment and self-propulsion, and does not require ad-
ditional features such as population heterogeneity [14] or
pairwise repulsion [29, 37]. We further show, using a
coarse-grained continuous model, that this phenomenol-
ogy originates from a generic long-wave instability, which
we trace back to the coupling between density and ori-
entational order inherent to the physics of flocks [21].
Microscopic model——The binary VM consists of point-
like self-propelled particles in two dimensions, aligning
their direction of motion with neighbors within unit dis-
tance. The position rj, and orientation 6} of particle k

noise uniformly drawn from [—7,7], while g(t) is the
total number of interacting neighbours of particle k (in-
cluding itself) at time t.

The sum in Eq. (1b) runs over U = A,B and particles j
satisfying |r, —r}| < 1, while the coupling —1 < y°° <1
defines how particles from species S$ align (°° > 0) or
anti-align (y°" < 0) their velocities with particles from
species U. The average coupling ¥ = a(x + x°*) then
describes the tendency of the two species to mutually
align (X > 0) or anti-align (¥ < 0) their velocities. In
turn, enforcing reciprocal interspecies alignment imposes
that Ay = d(x — x°) = 0, while interactions are non-
reciprocal otherwise.

When x*" = 1 for all s,u € {A,B}, the model re-
duces to the classical VM, while other limiting cases
such as fully anti-aligning mixtures [38], reciprocally anti-
aligning populations (x““"8 > 0, x < 0, Ax = 0) [39-41]
and self-anti-aligning species (x“*"* < 0) with aligning

interspecies interactions (y > 0) [42, 43] have been ad-
dressed in the literature. Here, we let particles of the
same species align (x“*8" = 1) while varying the inter-
species coulings x*" and y®*. In the regime of strong
nonreciprocity, where |Ax| > |X|, we observe oscillatory
behavior consistently with results reported in the liter-
ature [17, 31, 34]. Hereafter, however, we focus on the
weakly nonreciprocal regime, where |Ax| < |x|.

As we focus on the effects induced by nonreciprocity
alone, we discard the possible influence of population het-
erogeneity [44] by setting n*® = 7 and vj” = vp [45]. We
also consider equal densities p*"® = po = N/L?, where N
denotes the size of each population and L is the linear
size of the square domain. Unless specified otherwise, we
use po = 3 uw =1,x= +3, and vary the angular noise
7 and the nonreciprocity parameter Ay. Noting that
the problem is symmetric under the exchange A © B,
we further restrict the analysis to Ay > 0. To con-
struct the phase diagrams of Fig. 1(a,b), we numerically
integrated Eqs. (1) in periodic square domains of size
L = 512. Regardless of the sign of x, the system is disor-
dered at high noise and transitions to a symmetry broken
phase with nonzero global polar orders TI’ = (u(62))x
when 7 decreases. For all values of Ay, this transition
is mediated by a phase-coexistence region, reminiscent of
the microphase separation scenario in the single-species
VM [46, 47].

Mutually aligning populations.— For x > 0 at the on-
set of order, both species self-organize into dense bands
propagating through a dilute, gaseous background. As
shown in Fig. l(c) and in the Supplementary Mate-
rial [48], bands are mostly composed of a single species
and are systematically arranged in pairs, with particles
with the lower interspecies coupling (here B, in blue)
at the rear. Such pattern synchronization by nonre-
ciprocal alignment—also at play in discrete symmetry
flocks [34]—can be understood by considering a pair of
A and B bands traveling with the same velocity uj = up,
as shown in Fig. 1(c). Increasing the inter-band separa-
ion, particles interact with fewer neighbors of the other

species, causing the local polarization in the A band to
decay faster than that of the B band (since x48 > y®4).
As the velocity of a band is proportional to the local po-
ar order (from Eq. (1a)), this leads to uf < vj, causing
he B band to catch up. With a similar reasoning, we find
hat reducing the inter-band separation yields uv > vj,
such that the initial configuration is stabilized by nonre-
ciprocity. The reversed configuration with the B band in
ront is, in turn, always unstable.

Deeper in the ordered phase and for sufficiently low
Ax, the species form a homogeneous flock, characterized
y aligned mean polarities (II**),;. However, this phase
ecomes unstable for sufficiently high Ay, where nonre-
ciprocal alignment gives rise to traveling bands primar-
ily made of A particles, which here align more strongly.
After a coarsening process, the steady-state eventually
consists of a single band [Fig. 1(d)]. To characterize this

structure, we use density profiles averaged along the band
and over time, as depicted in Figs. 2(a,b). Contrary to
the microphase coexistence region at higher noise, the
density profiles reveal that the A-species band coincides
with a local depletion of B particles, and moves within a
homogenous polar liquid of the B species.

To determine the characteristic densities p? and p?
within the band, we use the position of the right and
left peak of the A and B density histograms, respectively,
as illustrated in Fig. 2(c). The band width W is then de-
fined from the half maximum of time-averaged A density
profiles. Performing simulations in systems of increasing
size, we show in Fig. 2(d) that W grows linearly with
L. Moreover, p? exhibits a finite-size behaviour which
we best fit as an algebraic convergence to an asymp-
totic value: p ~ p§, — AL~” with v ~ 4 [Fig. 2(e)].
These measures indicate that, up to strong finite size
effects, the single-band phase displays characteristics of
a phase-separated state in which both species sponta-
neously demix, despite the absence of repulsive interac-
tions. Figures 2(f,g) illustrate how the properties of this

resulting thin and dense band exists even for values o
x® = y — Ay as low as 1077, while it naturally disap-
ears when Ay = x.

Mutually anti-aligning populations.— For x < 0 anc
low nonreciprocity, the coexistence phase at the onset o:
order may consist of trains of bands moving in opposite
directions [Fig. 1(e)]. These apolar bands appear in equa
number and are regularly spaced for Ay = 0 [48], while
heir structure becomes irregular at higher nonreciproc-
ity. Consistently with results reported for Ay = 0 [41],
hese configurations coexist in a large part of the coexis-
ence phase with polar arrangements of bands of alternat-
ing species that travel in the same direction [Fig. 1(f)].
We do not observe dynamical transitions between po-
ar and apolar patterns, which are selected by the ini-

tial condition. Apolar bands occur more frequently at
low nonreciprocity and noise, while increasing Ay, polar
bands arise more often [48]. In fact, the latter become
the only observed configuration for sufficiently large 7
and Ax [purple region in Fig. 1(b)].

Similarly to aligning populations, the homogeneous liq-
uid with anti-aligned mean polar orders (II**), found at
Ax = 0 is only stable up to a finite amount of nonre-
ciprocity. Beyond a Ay threshold, the two species self-
organize in a laning pattern consisting of alternating do-
mains with opposite polarities [Fig. 1(h) and Supplemen-
tary movie (SMov) 1]. This pattern is highly dynamic, as
the lanes persistently rotate and drift over long timescales
(SMov 2), while they also intermittently break and re-
form. Increasing Ay, breaking events become more fre-
quent, eventually preventing the pattern from repairing
itself. At sufficiently high Ay, the populations demix
by arranging into polar clusters mainly made of a single

species that move in a chaotic manner and lack macro-
scopic spatial order [Fig. 1(g) and SMov 3]. The lane
breaking events, which are associated with a sharp de-
cay of polar order for both species [see Fig. Al(a) in
Appendix A], also happen more often in larger systems
(SMov 4). As a result, the system becomes progressively
disordered as revealed by the distributions of |II*| shown
in Fig. Al(b). We therefore expect the laning pattern to
eventually disappear in the thermodynamic limit, result-
ing in a disordered polar cluster phase.

Hydrodynamic theory—To gain a theoretical under-
standing of the above findings, we coarse-grained the mi-
croscopic model (1) into a continuous theory. Because of
its success at qualitatively capturing the physics of the
single-species VM, we followed the Boltzmann-Ginzburg-
Landau approach [49-51]. As detailed in Appendix B, we
first write the Boltzmann equation governing the evolu-
tion of the single-body distribution function f*(r,6,t)
associated with species Ss. By expanding f* in angular
Fourier modes, we then obtain infinite coupled hierar-
chies of nonlinear equations. The zeroth and first modes
correspond to the local particle densities (p*) and po-
larities (p*"), respectively, which are the physical fields
of interest. Using a standard scaling ansatz describing
the relative amplitude of the modes and their spatio-
temporal variations at the onset of order, we truncate
and close the hierarchies at the first nontrivial order. The
resulting hydrodynamic equations for p* and p* read

Except for aj which varies linearly with the densities, all
coefficients in Eqs. (2) are constant. In [48], we provide
their formal expressions in terms of integrals involving
the microscopic model parameters, as well as a Mathe-
matica notebook for computing them numerically.

Expressing the polarities as p* = s*a(6°), we rewrite
Eq. (2b) in terms of their magnitudes s* and orientations
6°. The homogeneous, Stanoneny solutions of Eqs. (2)
correspond to uniform p* = p) and s* = sj, which solve

where Fi = ai,(09, 95) — Lv, {WwW Styw5y 89 COs(APw) and
Ads; = 6° — 0°. When |Ay| < |X|, Eqs. (3) admit three
types of solutions. For sufficiently high noise, sj” =
0 indicating a disordered state. Decreasing 7 below a
threshold value marked by the cyan lines in Figs. 3, the
solutions bifurcate to an ordered state with sj’ > 0,
corresponding to a flocking (A@,, = 0, ¥ > 0) or anti-
flocking (A@,, = 7, ¥ < 0) configuration [52]. Since
Eqs. (3) are nonlinear, we determine sj”” numerically.
To analyse the stability of these solutions, we linearise
Eqs. (2) for small perturbations, which we express in
Fourier space: (6p°, 505, 5s°)(1r,t) > (5/°*, 66°, 68°)(q, t).
We obtain a six-dimensional linear system 0,X =
M(q)X, where X = (5p* 5p" 56° 56° 53% 538)" and
the matrix M(q) is given in [48] for completeness. We con-
struct the linear stability diagrams for both y > 0 [Fig.
3(a)] and x < 0 [Fig. 3(b)] by numerically evaluating
the eigenvalues of M(q) for various values of 7 and Ay,
and wave vectors q. In qualitative agreement with the
VM phenomenology [21] and our microscopic model sim-
ulations, both the flocking and anti-flocking solutions are
unstable at the onset of order. Similarly to single species
flocks, the resulting long-wavelength instability is charac-
terized by a growth rate Re(A)~I|q|? for |g| > 0 [49, 53].
We uncover an additional long-wavelength instability, lo-
cated deeper in the ordered phase, and which typically
requires sufficiently high nonreciprocity. For both the
flocking and anti-flocking cases this instability exhibits a
distinct scaling: Re(A)~|q| as |q| > 0 [inset of Fig. 3(b)],
indicating that it originates from a new mechanism [54].
To elucidate its origin, we consider the limit |q| + 0
where non-hydrodynamic modes can be enslaved. The
hydrodynamic modes —for which 0;(-) = O(|q|)— cor-
respond to the left eigenvectors of M(0) with zero eigen-
value. In the (anti-)flocking region, we find three of them:
the two density fields 6A, and @ = s8 F®60° + s8 F366".
Enslaving the fast modes and keeping only leading or-
der terms in |q| (details in Appendix C), the dynam-

ics reduces to a three-dimensional linear system OX =

Stable disordered, flocking and anti-flocking regions appear in

an instability, and are colored according to the orientation of
the most unstable wave vector with respect to the direction of
order. The solid cyan lines mark the onset of order, while the

lepend on the coefficients of Eq. (2) in a complex
way [48]. To further simplify the analysis, we note from
Fig. 3(a) that upon decreasing 7 the homogeneous flock-
ing solution is firstly unstable to longitudinal perturba-
tions, such that we set gq; = 0. The matrix M, then
has a purely imaginary eigenvalue Ag = iVgoq, while the
remaining two are given by

Ay = “al aL (Van + Vin + VR), (5)

where R = 4VVea + (Vax — Von)? When R > 0, the
eigenvalues in Eq. (5) are purely imaginary, and the sta-
bility of the solution to long-wavelength perturbations is
determined at O(|q|?). On the other hand, for R < 0 —
ie., when VapVea < —F(Vay —Van)?— the eigenvalue A_
acquires a positive real part, indicating the emergence
of an instability. In particular, for reciprocally align-
ing populations Va; and Vg, share the same sign and
R > 0, while the condition VasVg, < 0 requires a suf-
ficient amount of nonreciprocity. Anti-flocking mixtures
are more difficult to analyze, as in this case the insta-
bility is not purely longitudinal or transverse [Fig. 3(b)].
Nevertheless, the solid pink lines in Figs. 3 enclosing re-
gions for which Mj, has an eigenvalue with positive real
part show excellent agreement with the direct numerical
estimate based on the six-dimensional system. In partic-
ular, for ¥ > 0 the pink line corresponds to R = 0 when
the instability is longitudinal.

It is clear from Eqs. (4,5) that the new instability relies
on the coupling between the two density fields. There-
fore, it cannot arise in the single-species Vicsek model,
or when nonreciprocally aligning spins are fixed on a lat-
tice [55-57]. This also explains why it was missed in

Ref. [17], where fluctuations of the densities are discarded
in the analysis of the continuum model. Although R can-
not be compactly expressed in terms of the microscopic
model parameters, the density couplings in Eq. (4) can
e written as Vey = uj0p,£°, where L* is a linear combi-
nation of the a¥(p*, p®) coefficients in Eq. (2b) (details
in Appendix C). This formulation notably highlights that
he instability is driven by a combination of two ingre-
dients: the particles’ self-propulsion encoded by vp, and
he local (anti)-alignment of velocities, which is reflected
in the density dependencies of the a} coefficients.

We have shown that even weakly nonreciprocal inter-
actions significantly impact the collective dynamics of
ocking active matter. Combining agent-based simula-
ions and the analysis of a coarse-grained theory, our
results demonstrate that nonreciprocal alignment alone
constitutes a generic route to demixing, without resort-
ing to other mechanisms such as population heterogene-
ity [14] or pairwise repulsion [29, 37]. Our theoretical
study further emphasises that this phenomenology is in-
duced by the coupling between density and orientational
order, which shapes most of the characteristics of flocks.
Our findings echo recent works highlighting the fragility
of flocks [58] and their sensitivity to the presence of spa-
tial anisotropy [59], inclusions and boundaries [60, 61],
and quench disorder [62-64]. Since they rely solely on
weakly nonreciprocal alignment, we believe that our re-
sults will have implications for the modeling of a variety
of systems, including mixtures of Quincke rollers [14] or
Janus colloids [30], and migrating heterogeneous cellular
tissues [35].

52] In fact, both solution generally exist for small ¥ (more
details in [48]). However, the flocking and anti-flocking
solutions are only stable to homogeneous perturbations
for X > 0 and x < 0, respectively. For the linear stabil-
ity analysis with spatially-dependent perturbations, we
considered only these solutions.

Appendix A: Stability of the laning pattern.— As dis-
cussed in the main text, when increasing the system size
the laning pattern reported in Figs. 1(b,h) for mutually
anti-aligning species becomes more vulnerable to break-
ing events (see also SMov 4). Each of these events ap-
pears as a sharp decay of the global polar order |II*| for
both species, as shown in Fig. Al(a) for $ = A. Hence, the
corresponding polarity distributions develop a fat tail at
low order [Fig. Al(b)] which is more prominent in larger
systems, indicating that the latter become progressively
disordered.

Appendix B: Derivation of the continuum model.— We
coarse-grained a multi-population VM analogous to that
defined in Eqs. (1) via the Boltzmann-Ginzburg-Landau
(BGL) approach [49-51]. To keep the derivation general,
we consider here ng populations. Particles of species s
self-propel at constant speed v§ while we model the influ-
ence of angular noise via stochastic tumbling events hap-
pening at a frequency \* and with a distribution P,s(0)
with zero mean and standard deviation 7°.

As indicated in the main text, the BGL method con-
sists in first writing a Boltzmann equation governing the
evolution of the single-body distribution f*(r,6,t) asso-

(54) For y > 0, Fig. 3(a) displays a third unstable region at
low noises. As Eqs. (2) are derived perturbatively at the
onset of order (see Appendix B), this instability arises far
rom the formal range of validity of the continuum model
and, like for single species flocks, we believe that it is an
artifact resulting from approximations made during the
coarse-graining [51].

Equation (B3) is written under the standard assump-
tions behind the formulation of the Boltzmann equation.
Namely, we assume that collisions involving more than
two particles can be neglected, while they are sufficiently
local such that all distributions in (B3) depend on r only.
In addition, we used the molecular chaos hypothesis to
factorize the two-body particle distribution.

The kernel K*"(¢2 — 1) is proportional to the rate of
collisions between particles from species S$ and U with pre-
collisional orientations @; and ¢2, respectively. Following
a similar approach as for single-species flocks [53] yields

where rj is the radius of interaction associated with

while Aj = \8(Pg — 1) with P§ the k*" Fourier mode of

The zeroth and first modes fj and f} are of particular in-
terest, as they correspond to the complex representations
of the local particle densities p* and polarities p*, respec-
tively. Equation (B4) defines an infinite hierarchy, which
we close by assuming a standard scaling ansatz [49, 51]
describing the relative amplitudes of the Fourier modes
and their space and time derivatives at the onset of global
order. Namely,

lfelze’(k>0), |fe-pilee, OaxV~e,

where € is a small parameter. Formally, this scal-
ing ansatz supposes that all species exhibit comparable
global polarities. This should remain true in the presence
of weak population heterogeneity, which is the regime of
interest here.

We truncate the hierarchy at the first nontrivial order
e%. At this order, the equations for the particle densities
f§ = p® are exact, while f? obeys

We close the hierarchy by solving Eq. (B7) for f§ and
inserting the solution into Eq. (B6). Considering two
species with identical speed vp, interaction radius ro and
noise strength 7, we then recover Eqs. (2) of the main
text after adopting the vector representation ff — p*.
In all numerical calculations, we used a Gaussian noise
distribution such that P§ = exp[—k?7?/2].

For arbitrary alignment couplings x, the integrals (B5)
do not admit simple analytical expressions, such that
the coefficients in Eqs. (2) cannot be simply expressed
in terms of the parameters of the microscopic model.
For convenience, we thus provide in [48] a Mathemat-
ica notebook which can be used to evaluate numerically
the coefficients of the continuum model.

Appendiz C: Enslaving of the non-hydrodynamic
modes. — Here, we detail the enslaving procedure leading
to Eq. (4). We consider a m-dimensional linear system
of the form 0,X = M(q)-X, where M(q) is a wave-vector
dependent m x m matrix. As we are interested in the
q = |q| — 0 limit, we expand M as

M(q) = Mo + ight — q?Mp + O(@"), (Cl)
where the M; matrices are independent of g but may de-
pend on the direction of q.

We denote {Yj} as the left eigenbasis of Mo, such that
for allj =1,..., m, Yj ‘Mo = Aj¥;", where {Aj} are the
corresponding eigenvalues. Assuming that the initial lin-
ear system describes fluctuations around a solution which
is stable under g = 0 perturbations, all A; < 0. We now
suppose that the problem has n, hydrodynamic modes,
and we reorder the eigenvalues such that Ay,...,An, =0
and An,+1,--.,Am <0. Defining

x=(Y%-- Yin) -X=P-X, (C2)
the first ny elements of X are the hydrodynamic modes,
while the other m— ny are fast. This can be straightfor-
wardly shown from

P-My-X =diag(Ay...Am)-P-X

OX = P-O,X
q=0

= diag(Ay...Am) -X;

where we have used that P-Myg-P7! = diag(A1... Am).
While the slow modes are uniquely defined, the fast
modes may be expressed differently so long as they are
associated with a nonzero damping rate. The formula-
tion (C2) nevertheless provides a compact change of basis
formula between the slow and fast modes and the origi-
nal variables. Going back to q > 0, the dynamics of X
then follows 0:X =M(q)-X, where M=P-M-P-!. In
the regime of interest, P is always invertible. For conve-
nience, we write separately the dynamics of the hydro-
dynamic (Xj) and fast (X;) modes (dropping the tildes
to lighten notations):

Xp — Mp Xn = Mp - Xe,
O.X¢— ME. X; = ME. Xp,
in terms of the block matrices Mj. By construction, all

elements of MP and MP are zero for q = 0, while Mi(q =0)
is diagonal with negative entries representing the finite

damping rates of the fast modes. Expanding all block
matrices similarly to (C1), we then enslave the fast modes
by solving Eq. (C4) in the limit g > 0. Here, we focus
on the leading order solution, while a derivation including
O(q’) corrections is presented in [48]. Therefore,

i)
X;=— (Mio) -Mio- Xn + O(Q).

Replacing this solution in Eq. (C3), we then find that the
hydrodynamic modes obey 0:Xp = Mn(q) : Xn with

Hn(g) = ig (Oty — MP « (Meo) <M) +O(G?)- (C5)

Performing this analysis for the linear stability de-
scribed in the main text, we find three slow modes: 56?
and 6 = si F®664 + st F460". The expressions of the var-
ious matrices involved in the derivation are quite lengthy
and not very informative. We can nevertheless express
the coefficients that couple the density fluctuations in
