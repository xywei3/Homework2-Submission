"1. Introduction

“= Extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) are characterized by

intense emission lines that stand out prominently against their
stellar continuum, resulting in large rest-frame equivalent widths
(EWs). Some examples of these lines include rest-frame optical
Ww [0 ma5007A (hereafter [O III]) and Ha. The strong nebular
CN emission lines are typically powered by ionizing photons emit-
; ted from massive, short-lived O and B stars (or active galactic
— nuclei, AGN), while the surrounding rest-frame optical contin-
Ww) uum arises mainly from longer-lived, lower-mass stars (e.g., El-
CN\\ dridge & Stanway 2022). Therefore, EW provides insight into
<° the ratio of very young to older stellar populations, serving as an
‘ 7 indicator of variations in star formation history (SFH) over time.
Identifying EELGs within a galaxy population can reveal galax-
s4 ies experiencing a burst in star formation (e.g., Endsley et al.
SS 2024), often characterized by high specific star formation rates
(sSFR) and compact morphologies (e.g., Tang et al. 2022).
Based on the recent Attenuation-Free Model (AFM, Ferrara
2024), elevated sSFR > 25 Gyr™! might be linked to galax-
ies that become super-Eddington and trigger a radiation-driven
outflow that clears the dust, making the galaxy UV brighter
and bluer. The presence of such outflows is crucial for under-
standing the escape of ionizing Lyman continuum (LyC, Arest <
912 A) photons, as they can create ionized, dust-free channels
that enable the leakage of LyC photons (e.g., Hogarth et al.
2020; Amorin et al. 2024; Carr et al. 2025; Komarova et al.

2025). Outflows can significantly increase the visibility of the
Lya line even at z > 5.5 — 6 when the intergalactic medium
(IGM) is not fully ionized (e.g., Fan et al. 2006; Mason &
Gronke 2020). In samples of z > 7 galaxies, where in princi-
ple Lya should be strongly attenuated by the neutral IGM, high
EW(Lya) are associated with high sSFRs and ionized bubbles
large enough to produce frequency shifting that reduces the ef-
fects of resonant scattering for Lya (e.g., Endsley et al. 2022;
Bunker et al. 2023; Tang et al. 2023; Witstok et al. 2025). Evi-
dence of outflows has been observed in samples of [O III] emit-
ters in a wide range of redshifts (e.g., Llerena et al. 2023;
Saldana-Lopez et al. 2025; Cooper et al. 2025) with a fraction
of ~ 20% of galaxies at z < 6 showing signatures of outflows
(e.g., Calabro et al. 2024b; Carniani et al. 2024). Furthermore,
strong [O 111]424959, 5007A+HB (hereafter [O III]+Hf) emis-
sion and high 032=log([{O II]/[O 11]AA3727,3729A) have been
suggested as a necessary requirement for high escape fractions of
LyC photons (fescyyc) given that these conditions are observed
in a high proportion of confirmed LyC leaking galaxies (e.g.,
Vanzella et al. 2016; Izotov et al. 2021). Additionally, galax-
ies exhibiting high EW([O III) tend to show enhanced ionizing
photon production efficiencies (&,,) at different redshifts (e.g.,
Chevallard et al. 2018; Tang et al. 2019; Llerena et al. 2025).
However, very high fescyyc or very low metallicities could af-
fect the strength of [O III] emission, so the connection is still not
fully understood (e.g., Endsley et al. 2023; Laseter et al. 2025).
Due to their extreme emission properties and intense star for-
mation activity, EELGs serve as valuable laboratories for study-
ing the physical conditions and mechanisms that enable the es-

cape of both LyC and Lya photons, offering key insights into
their role in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). EELGs are ob-
served at different redshifts, from the local universe (e.g., Car-
damone et al. 2009; Amorin et al. 2010; Izotov et al. 2011), in-
termediate redshifts z ~ 1 — 3 (e.g., van der Wel et al. 2011;
Amorin et al. 2015; Maseda et al. 2018; Tang et al. 2019; Du
et al. 2020; Llerena et al. 2023), and during the EoR (e.g., Smit
et al. 2015; De Barros et al. 2019; Boyett et al. 2024; Llerena
et al. 2024; Davis et al. 2024; Begley et al. 2025a; Daikuhara
et al. 2025). These high-EW systems can be identified through
either direct spectroscopy or indirect photometric flux excesses,
where strong line emission significantly enhances the flux in
determined filters. JWST (Gardner et al. 2006, 2023) has en-
abled highly sensitive near-infrared spectroscopy with NIRSpec
(Jakobsen et al. 2022), covering wavelengths up to 5.3 zm. This
makes it possible to directly measure rest-frame optical emission
lines at high-z, such as Ha up to z < 7 and [O III] up toz < 9.5.
These capabilities allow for robust identification of EELGs and
a detailed characterization of their physical properties as spec-
troscopic samples continue to grow.

In Llerena et al. (2024), a sample of EELG candidates at
z = 4-9 in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS, 14h19m00s
+52°48’00", Davis et al. 2007) field was identified based on
their JWST/NIRCam (Rieke et al. 2023) photometry, specifically
using the F277W, F356W, F444W, and F410M filters. The selec-
tion was restricted to galaxies with rest-frame EW([O III]+H£) >
680A, motivated by the average spectra of rare, metal-poor star-
bursts in the local universe (Sanchez Almeida et al. 2012; Pérez-
Montero et al. 2021). Based on their photometry, these candi-
dates exhibit low stellar masses, high sSFRs, and compact mor-
phologies—characteristics associated with young, rapidly evolv-
ing galaxies. In this paper, we analyze the JWST/NIRSpec spec-
tra of a subsample of these candidates to confirm the presence
of such extreme emission lines. With this spectroscopic confir-
mation, we investigate their physical properties, including their
ionization conditions and star formation activity, and explore the
mechanisms driving the elevated EWs. We further investigate the
potential link between strong optical line emission and the pro-
duction and escape of LyC photons, thereby assessing the role of
EELGs in cosmic reionization. Since our analysis is restricted to
the EGS field, we note that cosmic variance must be taken into
account, as this region has been suggested to be already nearly
fully ionized by z ~ 7 (e.g., Napolitano et al. 2024; Chen et al.
2025; Napolitano et al. 2025b)

This paper is organized as follows: in Sec. 2, we describe
the sample selection. In Sec. 3, we outline the procedures for
measuring emission lines and performing spectral energy distri-
bution (SED) fitting. We also derive star formation rates from
Balmer lines, the rest-frame UV continuum slopes (8), abso-
lute UV magnitudes, and the gas-phase metallicity. In Sec. 4,
we present the physical properties of the samples, including
the confirmation of the extreme EWs, the dust reddening, and
the B slopes. In Sec. 5, we analyze the source of ionization of
the EELGs based on emission line diagnostics. In Sec. 6.1, we
present the results of the estimated éjo, in this sample. In Sec.
6.2 and Sec. 6.3, we present the results regarding the escape of
Lya and LyC photons. In Sec. 7, we discuss the potential drivers
of the elevated EWs, which include high sSFRs, compactness,
and burstiness. Finally, we present our summary and conclusions
in Sec. 8.

Throughout this paper, we adopt a A-dominated flat universe
with Qy = 0.7, Qy = 0.3, and Ho = 70 km s“! Mpc™!. All

lines. We adopt log(O/H)o = 8.69 (Asplund et al. 2009). We
assumed the Kroupa (2001) initial mass function (IMF) for the
SED fitting. We report Spearman’s correlation coefficients (p)
with their p-values (p), to assess the strength and significance of
correlations.

2. Data and sample selection

In this study, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the selec-
tion method proposed in Llerena et al. (2024) for identifying
EELGs at z = 4 — 9 based on their photometry and then to
study their properties to understand the origin of the extreme
emission lines. To this end, we construct a subsample of galax-
ies from the parent sample with available JWST/NIRSpec ob-
servations. This includes spectra from the following JWST sur-
veys: the CANDELS-Area Prism Epoch of Reionization Survey
(CAPERS, GO-6368; PI Mark Dickinson), the Cosmic Evolu-
tion Early Release Science survey (CEERS, Finkelstein et al.
2023, 2024, 2025), and the Red Unknowns: Bright Infrared Ex-
tragalactic Survey (RUBIES, de Graaff et al. 2025).

2.1. CAPERS sample

CAPERS is an ongoing JWST Cycle 3 Treasury program of
moderately deep NIRSpec multiobject spectroscopy in three
fields from CANDELS (Grogin et al. 2011; Koekemoer et al.
2011), which includes the EGS field. CAPERS is obtaining
low-resolution NIRSpec/PRISM spectra for thousands of distant
galaxies, including objects at z > 10 (e.g., Kokorev et al. 2025).
We cross-matched the list of EELG candidates in Llerena et al.
(2024) with the available NIRSpec/PRISM spectra from the CA-
PERS survey in the EGS field, and we considered the spectra
from the data release of the collaboration for the analysis. The
data reduction is described in Taylor et al. (2025b). We identi-
fied 62 candidates in the survey, but excluded 7 from the sample
because their bright emission lines, based on the photometric
redshift, coincided with a detector gap. We discarded an addi-
tional galaxy because its reduced spectrum was contaminated by
a secondary source in the slit.

2.2. CEERS and RUBIES samples

We also cross-matched the list of EELG candidates in Llerena
et al. (2024) with the available spectra in the Public NIRSpec
datasets (v3) published on the DAWN JWST Archive (DJA!',
Heintz et al. 2024; de Graaff et al. 2025) and we used the NIR-
Spec data reduced by the Cosmic Dawn Center. In particular,
we selected galaxies from the CEERS and RUBIES surveys
with NIRSpec/PRISM and NIRSpec/G395M (medium resolu-
tion, MR) spectra. Regarding the CEERS subsample, we found
32 galaxies with PRISM spectra in the DJA database. We ex-
cluded 3 galaxies because their bright emission lines coincide
with a detector gap, as determined by the photometric redshift.
We also found 10 galaxies with MR spectra. Regarding the RU-
BIES subsample, we identified 48 galaxies with PRISM spectra
in the DJA database, excluding 4 because of the detector gaps,
as in the CEERS subsample. In addition, we found 76 galaxies
with MR spectra and excluded 5 of them for the same reason.

In summary, our final sample consists of 208 spectra: 127
EELG candidates observed with the PRISM configuration and
81 with the MR configuration. A subsample of 42 galaxies was

observed in both PRISM and MR within CEERS and RUBIES,
for which we analyze both spectra. Additionally, two galaxies
are included in both CAPERS and RUBIES, and four more are
observed in both CEERS and RUBIES. Given the small overlap
among surveys, we retain all spectra in our analysis. Therefore,
the final sample comprises 160 unique galaxies. The coordinates
of the galaxies, the corresponding survey and disperser, are listed
in Table A.1. Throughout this paper, individual galaxies are iden-
tified using their IDs from the CEERS photometric catalog.

2.3. Spectroscopic redshifts

As a first step, we assessed the accuracy of the photometric red-
shifts (Zpnor). To this aim, we used LiMe? (Fernandez et al. 2024),
a library that provides a set of tools to fit lines in astronomical
spectra, to estimate the spectroscopic redshifts (Zsp¢-) in both the
PRISM and MR spectra. We assumed a single Gaussian for each
line, with [O III]+Hf modeled together as three blended Gaus-
sians, while Ha was modeled with a Gaussian profile, merged
(blended) with [N 11]AA6548,6583A for PRISM (MR) spectra.
We adopted Zpno; as an initial estimate of the redshift. We de-
termined the observed central wavelength of the Gaussian fits of
[O IIT] to calculate zspec. When [O III] is not covered by the spec-
tral range, the observed central peak of Ha is used to determine
Zspec: The distribution of Zspec of the sample is displayed in Fig.
1 and reported in Table A.1. The sample covers redshifts from
z = 3.86 to z = 9.00 with a median z = 5.22 (0 = 1.17). In
Fig. 1 we show a comparison between Zpjo; and Zspec, including
the lo uncertainty of the z,n., based on their probability distri-
bution functions (Finkelstein et al. 2023). We find a good agree-
ment (9 = 0.97, p ~ 0) between both quantities with a mean
AZ = Zphot — Zspec = 0.13 (& = 0.23) after removing overlapping
sources. The galaxies at z ~ 4 with large z,j,; uncertainties often
have low-z solutions with high probability, which are ruled out
by the spectroscopic data. We highlight that no catastrophic out-
liers with Az > 3 are found. We note that larger Az are observed
at z ~ 6—7. In this range, [O III]+Hf falls within the F356W
filter, while Ha lies in the broader F444W filter. Although the

? https: //lime-stable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

F410M filter sits between them, it primarily samples the contin-
uum rather than overlapping a strong spectral feature, and thus
provides limited improvement in redshift precision. The combi-
nation of these two broad filters appears to result in less accurate
Zphor eStimates compared to the z ~ 4 — 6 range, where Ha may
be captured by the narrower F410M filter, or where strong emis-
sion lines fall into the F277W and F356W filters, both of which
are narrower than F444W.

3. Data analysis

Before proceeding with the spectral analysis, and given the dif-
ferent data reduction applied to the sample, we evaluate poten-
tial slit losses by comparing NIRCam photometry with synthetic
photometry derived from the spectra. This consistency check en-
sures that the extracted spectra are properly calibrated and that
any significant discrepancies, potentially arising from slit losses
or extraction artifacts, are identified and corrected. We used the
same photometry described in Sec. 3.2. We find that, on av-
erage, the correction factor—defined as the ratio between ob-
served and synthetic photometry—does not show a significant
wavelength dependence, which is consistent with previous works
(e.g., Roberts-Borsani et al. 2024; Napolitano et al. 2025a), and
yields a median value of 1.21. Therefore, to account for slit
losses, we scale each spectrum by a constant correction factor,
which is unique to each galaxy and calculated as the uncertainty-
weighted median of the correction factors across all observed
filters for that galaxy.

3.1. Emission line measurements

We performed a second set of measurements using LiMe to esti-
mate the fluxes and EWs of emission lines. In Fig. B.1 and B.2,
we display the median spectra of galaxies observed with PRISM
and MR, respectively, highlighting key spectral features. We
modeled [O 11]AA3727,3729 (hereafter [O II]), [Ne 11]43868A
(hereafter [Ne III]), [O HI]+H, and Ha in all galaxies using a
single Gaussian profile for each line and a local linear contin-
uum, estimated from 100 A (50 A)-wide windows on either side
of each line for the PRISM (MR) data. For lines with a signal-
to-noise ratio (S/N) below 3, we adopt a 3a upper limit. To es-
timate the rest-frame EWs, we use the continuum measured di-
rectly from the spectra when it is detected with S/N > 2 (48% of
the sample for [O II]+Hf and 32% of the sample for Ha with
PRISM), and propagate both the line flux and continuum uncer-
tainties to derive the uncertainty of EWs. When the continuum
is undetected, we adopt the continuum estimated from the SED
model (see Sec.3.2), and derive its uncertainty by propagating
the uncertainties of the photometry from the two closest filters
in wavelength to each line. On average, the ratio between the
continuum measured from the spectra and from the SED model
is 0.9—1.1. The EWs and uncertainties are reported in Table A.1.

Given the complexity of Lya, we performed a separate set
of measurements using the PRISM spectra, which provide suit-
able wavelength coverage. Owing to the low spectral resolution
of the PRISM, Lya is modeled within a 2-pixel window centered
on the observed emission peak. As a first step, we compute the
line flux via direct integration over this window. The continuum
is estimated by a linear fit to the red side of Lya, from 1900 A to
3 pixels redward of the emission peak. We adopt a 3a" upper limit
for Ly@ emission if the S/N < 3 or if the measured flux is neg-
ative. In our sample, we find 21 galaxies with Lya@ in emission
(above 37), i.e., Lya emitters (LAE). We note that, in contrast to

ground-based observations with larger slit widths, and given the
resonant nature of Lya emission—where Lya photons can scat-
ter to spatial scales exceeding the stellar continuum—JWST slit
losses of 35% have been reported for Lya samples at z = 6 — 7
(Napolitano et al. 2025b, and references therein). We adopt this
average value to correct for possible Lya slit losses.

3.2. Spectral Energy Distribution fitting

To estimate the physical properties of the galaxies in our sample,
namely stellar mass, star-formation rate (SFR), and dust attenu-
ation E(B—V), we update the SED fitting performed in Llerena
et al. (2024). First, we used BAGPIPES version 1.2.0 (Carnall
et al. 2018) with the Bruzual & Charlot (2003) stellar popula-
tion models and photometry from the CEERS Photometric Cat-
alogs v0.51.2 (Finkelstein et al. 2025). The photometry was per-
formed with SExtractor (v2.25.0; Bertin & Arnouts 1996) with
F277W and F356W as the detection bands. The fiducial fluxes
were measured in small Kron apertures corrected by large-scale
flux, following the methodology in Finkelstein et al. (2023). The
catalog includes photometric measurements in seven NIRCam
filters: F11SW, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, and
F444W. In addition, it incorporates archival HST imaging of the
EGS field from programs such as CANDELS (Koekemoer et al.
2011; Grogin et al. 2011), covering the filters F606W, F814W,
F105W, F125W, F140W, and F160W.

We fixed the redshift to zspec. We adopt a non-parametric
SFH from Leja et al. (2019), using eight time bins where SFR
is fit with a constant value in each bin. The first four bins are set
to lookback times of 0-3, 3-10, 10-30, and 30-100 Myr, while
the last four bins are logarithmically spaced between 100 Myr
and tax = tuniverse( = Zspec) ~ tuniverse(Z = 20). We allow the
metallicity to freely vary up to 0.5 Zo. The upper limit in metal-
licity is based on the stellar mass-metallicity relation observed at
z = 3.5 for a stellar mass of 10!'Mo (Llerena et al. 2022; Stan-
ton et al. 2024), which is in agreement with the range of stellar
masses of the sample (Llerena et al. 2024). For the dust compo-
nent, we consider the Calzetti et al. (2000) attenuation curve and
let Ay vary between 0 — 2 mag. We also include a nebular com-
ponent in the model, and we let the ionization parameter log U
freely vary between —4 and 0.

Given that incorporating JWST/MIRI (Wright et al. 2015)
detections into SED modeling of galaxies may lower their stel-
lar mass by 0.25 dex at z = 4—- 6 and 0.38 dex atz = 6-9
(Papovich et al. 2023), we checked the MIRI imaging provided
by CEERS which includes eight pointings, four of which pro-
vide deep imaging with the bluer bands (F560W and F770W)
and four of which provide contiguous wavelength coverage in
F1000W, F1280W, F1500W, and F1800W, where two of these
also include coverage in F770W and F2100W (Yang et al. 2023).
Only six galaxies in our sample (at z ~ 4.5 — 8.7) are in the MIRI
footprint with F560W and F770W imaging, and they have de-
tections in both bands. Although MIRI bands are not included in
the SED fitting, we find good agreement, within the uncertain-
ties, between the synthetic photometry from the SED model and
the observed F560W and F770W photometry in this subsample,
except for one galaxy (ID: 47521) whose observed photometry
is larger by a factor of 2.5 compared to the model. This suggests
that the SED modeling reliably reproduces the reddest part of the
SED, not covered by NIRCam, across the sample of EELGs.

LyC leakers at z ~ 0.3 (Flury et al. 2022a; Jaskot et al. 2024a,b). The
dashed-dotted lines represent constant sSFR lines.

3.3. Star-formation rates from Balmer lines

We corrected the line fluxes for dust reddening, adopting the
Calzetti et al. (2000) attenuation law, which is consistent with
the SED fitting. We considered the stellar E(B-V) value from
the SED fitting. A comparison with the nebular E(B-V) obtained
by Balmer lines is presented in Sec. 4.2. In particular, we con-
verted the dust-corrected Ha luminosity L(Ha) to SFR assum-
ing the calibration from Shapley et al. (2023) as SFR(Balmer) =
L(Ha) x 10-4137, Some systematics of these calibrations include
the IMF and extinction (e.g., Kennicutt & Evans 2012). This is
the most suited calibration according to subsolar metallicities ex-
pected for our galaxies at z > 4. We rescaled these values by
a factor of 0.94 (Madau & Dickinson 2014), accounting for the
IMF mismatch in the calibration (Chabrier 2003) and in the SED
fitting (Kroupa 2001). When Ha is not covered, we used Hf lu-
minosity assuming Ha/HB= 2.79 under case B approximation
for T. = 15 000 K and n, = 100 cm~3 (Pérez-Montero 2017). In
Appendix C, we checked that the estimated SFRs trace the aver-
age SFR in the last 10 Myr. We use these Balmer-based SFRs to
estimate the sSFRs which are reported in Table A.1.

The distribution of SFR vs M, for the sample is shown in
Fig. 2. As a reference, we show the main sequence of star-
forming (SF) galaxies from Calabro et al. (2024b) derived from
a spectroscopic sample of galaxies in a wide range of redshifts
z = 4-10. Our sample is scattered above the main sequence
(e.g., Speagle et al. 2014; lyer et al. 2018; Cole et al. 2025), and
the galaxies cover ~ 2 dex in stellar mass and SFR. The sample
is composed of low-mass galaxies from log(M,/Mo)=7.18 up
to log(M,/M.,)=9.42, with a median of log(M,/M,)=8.26. This
offset above the main-sequence is also observed in samples of
low-z EELGs (e.g., Calabro et al. 2017). For comparison, we also
plot galaxies at z = 0.2 — 0.4 with LyC detections from the Low-
redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS; Flury et al. 2022a)
and archival programs (Jaskot et al. 2024a,b). Throughout the
paper and in subsequent plots, this reference sample is divided
into strong (fesctyc > 10%) and weak (fesciyc < 10%) leakers.

From Fig. 2, we note that for a similar range in stellar mass, the
galaxies in our sample show SFRs consistent with those of the
LzLCS galaxy sample, even though the latter extends to galaxies
with higher stellar masses.

3.4. UV B slope and Myy magnitude

The rest-frame UV continuum slope can be represented by a
power-law f;, o A%, as modeled by Calzetti et al. (1994). For
the calculation of B, we considered galaxies with PRISM spectra
and the fitting windows in the original definition of Calzetti et al.
(1994) that exclude contamination by UV lines. We considered
the rest-frame range 1309 A < A < 2580 A. We excluded shorter
wavelengths due to the impact of Lya damping wing, resulting
in redder £ (see Dottorini et al. 2025). We fit the windows with
a linear relation log f,; = Blog A+ q. The fit is performed using
EMCEE (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013) with 50 walkers and 5000
steps. We adopt a flat prior on 8 between -4 and 0. The best-
fit value is taken as the posterior median, and the uncertainty is
defined by the 16th—84th percentile interval. Additionally, we es-
timated the absolute UV magnitudes (Muy) of the galaxies from
the best-fit of the UV continuum of the spectra. At each step of
the fitting, we computed the flux density at 1500 A and we deter-
mined the median of the posterior distribution, while the uncer-
tainty is given by the 16th-84th percentiles. We obtained Muy
values from —22.12 to -17.71, with a mean value of —19.27.

To account for possible residual slit losses that are not cor-
rected by the assumption of a no wavelength-dependent correc-
tion factor, we estimated the 8 slope using only the photometry
and checked consistency with the value estimated directly from
spectra. To this aim, we considered NIRCam filters with pivot
rest-frame wavelength between 1309 and 3645A (Balmer break).
Depending on the redshift, it implies fitting between 2 and 4 fil-
ters. In Fig. D.1 we show the difference between the # calculated
from the spectrum and from the photometry. We find a median
difference AB = |Bspec — Bpnotol = 0.36 (0 = 0.32). This signif-
icant discrepancy arises from the limited number of filters em-
ployed in the photometric estimation. In the following analysis
regarding B slope, we consider the estimation based on the spec-
tra only in the galaxies where AB < 0.68 (dashed lines in Fig.
D.1), which is 75% of the sample, excluding galaxies where £ is
more different than lo the median AZ. For this subsample, we
obtained values between —2.91 and —1.14 for the B slope, with
a mean value of —2.00. The mean uncertainty in the B slopes is
0.25. The estimated spectroscopic 8 slopes are reported in Table
Al.

3.5. Gas-phase metallicity

We estimate the gas-phase metallicity using the
R23=([ON1]A14959,5007+[O IL])/H8 calibration presented
in Sanders et al. (2024) for galaxies at z = 2.1 — 8.7. Given that
this relation is bivalued, we also used the O32 calibration in
Sanders et al. (2024). We consider the metallicity estimation to
be the value from the R23 calibration that is closer to the value
from the O32 calibration. We found a mean log(O/H)+12=7.71,
equivalent to 0.10 Zo, but the values range from 0.03 to 0.8 Zo.
The same results are obtained in this approach if we use the
Ne302=log([Ne III]/[O I1]) calibration instead of O32.

In the sample of galaxies with MR spectra, we find 8
galaxies where [O 11]24363A is detected with S/N > 3. The
(O II}/[O 1]a4363A ratios (Pérez-Montero 2017) indicate
T, > 1.46 x 10*K in this subsample. For one galaxy (ID: 81061)

we also detect [O II] and Hf, and can estimate the gas-phase
metallicity with the direct method following Pérez-Montero
(2017). We found a gas-phase metallicity 0.11 — 0.19 Zo, in
agreement with the mean value obtained with the calibrations.

4. Characterisation of the sample of EELGs

In this section, we focus on validating the selection method used
to identify EELG candidates based on photometric criteria. Ad-
ditionally, we investigate their physical properties, with partic-
ular emphasis on dust reddening as inferred from Balmer ratios
and UV spectral slopes, characterized by the 8 parameter.

4.1. Confirmation of extreme EWs

Fig. 3 shows a comparison between the EWs measured from the
spectra and those estimated from the photometry in Llerena et al.
(2024). In the top panel, we display the EW([O II]+H£), and we
show that there is a moderate correlation (9 = 0.50, p ~ 0) be-
tween the estimation and the spectroscopic confirmation with a
median underestimation of 0.11 dex (a = 0.22) in the photo-
metric values. This indicates that most of the candidates selected
in the sample are EELGs with high EWs. We note that in 154

spectra (74%) both [O III] and Hf are detected, with 93% of
them showing EW({O III]+H@)>680 A, which corresponds to
the selection threshold adopted in Llerena et al. (2024). In 21
spectra (10%), [O III] is detected while only an upper limit is
available for HB; among these, 62% present an upper limit in
EW((O I1]+H) higher than the selection threshold. In 8 spec-
tra (4%), only [O III] is detected while Hf is not covered by
the spectral range, and 75% of these already exhibit lower lim-
its for EW([O II]+H) above the selection threshold. Finally,
in 25 spectra (12%), neither [O III] nor Hf are covered by the
analyzed spectra. In summary, excluding the spectra where nei-
ther [O III] nor Hf are covered, the success rate of spectra with
EW((O III]+H) above the selection threshold (or consistent up-
per/lower limits) reaches 89%. For subsequent analysis, we re-
moved galaxies that, based on either measured or limit values,
do not fulfill the selection criterion of EW([O II]+H)> 680 A,
since these sources were not targeted in photometric selection
and would otherwise introduce incompleteness into the sample.
In this analyzed sample, we found a_ median
log(EW({O III]+HB)[A])=3.20 (1616 A) and a 16-84th
percentile range of 2.99 to 3.44 (997 to 2785 A). Such high
EWs have been observed in galaxies in the EoR in photometric-
selected samples (e.g., De Barros et al. 2019; Daikuhara
et al. 2025) and with slitless spectroscopy (e.g., Matthee
et al. 2023). Regarding only EW([O III]), we found a median
log(EW({O II])[A])=3.04 (1095 A) and a 16-84th percentile
range of 2.80 to 3.28 (635 to 1946 A). In Fig. E.1, we show that
EW(([O IlI]) and EW(H8) are strongly correlated, suggesting
a common source of ionization. On the other hand, in the
bottom panel of Fig. 3, we instead display the comparison
with EW(Ha), and we find a weaker correlation (9 = 0.21,
p ~ 8x 107), but confirm the high EWs estimated from
the photometry with a median underestimation of 0.08 dex
(o = 0.44). We found a median log(EW(Ha)[A])=2.88 (763 A)
and a 16-84th percentile range of 2.71 to 3.11 (518 to 1307 A).
In Appendix F, we compared the fluxes and EWs of bright
emission lines obtained with each disperser in the subsample
with both PRISM and MR spectra. We show that they correlate
strongly, with higher PRISM fluxes by ~ 0.06 dex on average.

4.2. Dust reddening

The results obtained from the SED fitting indicate a wide diver-
sity in global dust attenuation among the galaxies in our sam-
ple. The derived stellar E(B—V) values span a broad range, from
0.009 to 0.46, highlighting significant variations in the amount
of dust present within these systems. As an alternative approach
to estimating dust attenuation, we use the Balmer emission lines
in the subset of galaxies where both Ha and Hf are detected.
By comparing the observed Balmer decrement (Ha/H£) to the
theoretical ratio expected for case B recombination, we derive
independent estimates of dust reddening for this subsample.

To estimate the nebular E(B — V)nep, we considered the the-
oretical ratio Ha/HB=2.79 under case B approximation for T,
= 15 000 K and n, = 100 cm~? (Pérez-Montero 2017), and
the Calzetti et al. (2000) extinction law. In Fig. 4 we show the
Balmer ratios as a function of EW([O III]). As can be seen, most
of the galaxies in the sample show Ha/Hf ratios higher than the
theoretical value, indicating they are affected by dust reddening.
In these cases, we find a mean Ha/HB=3.64 (0 = 0.96), which
implies a mean E(B — V)neh = 0.20 (0 = 0.17). This value is
slightly higher than the mean stellar E(B — V) = 0.10 (ao = 0.07)
obtained from the SED fitting for the same subsample, but the

difference is not statistically significant at the lo level. Previ-
ous studies have reported that the offset between nebular and
stellar E(B—V) decreases with increasing sSFR (Koyama et al.
2019). Interestingly, there is a subsample of galaxies that shows
Ha/Hf ratios lower than the theoretical value, taking into ac-
count the typical uncertainty of the Ha/Hf ratios in the sample.
They represent 11% of the sample where Ha and Hf were de-
tected. These cases can be explained by a scenario in which case
B of recombination is not satisfied, and ionizing photons can
escape into the IGM. Nevertheless, wavelength-dependent slit
losses cannot be excluded for these galaxies.

Overall, we do not find a clear trend of dust attenuation with
EW((O III)), and for a given EW([O III]), the Ha/Hf ratios and
the equivalent E(B — V)nep are diverse. We will discuss this in
Sec. 7.1 in the context of the AFM model.

4.3. How blue are EELGs?

In Fig. 5, we show the relation between Myy and £ slope for our
sample. The median distribution of our sample (red line in Fig.
5) tends to follow the decreasing relation reported in Dottorini
et al. (2025), which includes a spectroscopic sample of galaxies
at similar redshifts. This decreasing trend is also predicted by
semi-analytic models (SAMs) at z = 4— 10 (Yung et al. 2019), in
agreement with our results. For galaxies with Myy < —21.06, the
galaxies tend to be bluer than the general population with values
lower than the best-fit in Dottorini et al. (2025) for a given Muy.
However, in this Myy range, the comparison sample contains
relatively few galaxies, limiting the statistical significance of this
trend. For galaxies with Myy 2 —21.06, we find a wide range of
B slopes, bluer and redder than the general population of galax-
ies at similar redshifts for a given Myy. Compared to the LzLCS
sample, the values of 8 are consistent in the range of Myy that
both samples cover, except for galaxies Myy < —21.06 where
we do not find extremely red galaxies in our sample and they are
likely to be weak LyC leakers at z ~ 0.3. We find that most of the
galaxies have 8 > —2.6, which indicates they are not super-blue
and they are above the theoretical lower limit produced by dust-
free pure stellar and nebular continuum emission (e.g., Cullen
et al. 2024). Only 7% of the sample exhibits 6B < —2.6; how-
ever, none of these measurements are below this value at a level
greater than lo.

5. Are EELGs primarily AGN or SF galaxies?

Understanding whether the ionizing radiation in galaxies arises
from massive stars or AGN is fundamental for interpreting the
physical conditions within EELGs. This distinction is particu-
larly relevant in the context of the early universe, where EELGs
are considered potential analogs of the galaxies that contributed
to cosmic reionization. In this section, we investigate the nature
of the ionizing sources in our sample to determine whether stel-
lar populations alone can account for the observed emission or if
additional sources, such as AGN, are required.

5.1. Emission line diagnostic diagrams

For the subsample of galaxies where [Ne III] is detected or
with upper limits, we analyze the OHNO diagram (Backhaus
et al. 2022), which is used at high-z to disentangle the domi-
nant source of ionization. We detect [Ne III] and [O II] in only
39 galaxies across the entire sample. For 9 additional galaxies,
the detection of [O II] allows us to place an upper limit on the
[Ne III]/[O IL] ratio. We used this subsample, representing 25%
of the total sample, for the OHNO analysis. For an additional 45
galaxies, both [Ne II] and [O II] fall within the spectral cover-
age, yet only upper limits are obtained for both lines. We ana-
lyze the stacked PRISM spectra of these galaxies following the
methodology described in Section B to construct the compos-
ite spectrum. In Fig. 6, we show the distribution of our sample in
the OHNO diagram. Based on the demarcation line from Feuillet
et al. (2024) calibrated for galaxies z < 1.06, only 2 galaxies are
in the SF region at 3 level, which represents 2.2% of the sam-
ple where [Ne III] and [O II] fall within the spectral coverage. 13
(18) galaxies are in the AGN region at the 3a (2c) level, which
represents 14% (19.4%) of the same sample. 33 (28) galaxies
overlap with the demarcation at the 3a (2c) level, suggesting
that the dominant ionization source cannot be clearly identified,
which represents 35.5% (30.1%) of the same sample. However,
we note that this region of the diagram close to the demarcation
line is also populated by the sample of low-z LyC leakers with
elevated [O III]/H ratios. In addition, photoionization model

predictions for SF and AGN often overlap in this region (Cal-
abro et al. 2023, 2024a), with the ionization parameter emerging
as the main driver independently of the ionizing source (Cleri
et al. 2025). We also note that the mean log({O III]/H8)= 0.85
for the subsample included in the OHNO diagram is higher than
the mean log({O II]/HB)= 0.72 measured for the remainder
48.3% of the sample where neither [Ne III] nor [O II] is de-
tected with S/N> 3. The stacked spectrum of this latter subsam-
ple falls within the SF region. This suggests that the galaxies
in the OHNO diagram represent the most extreme in terms of
[O I1]/Hf ratios, potentially indicating harder ionizing spectra
and distinct gas-phase metallicities compared to the rest of the
sample (e.g., Kewley & Dopita 2002; Bian et al. 2018).

To further investigate this conclusion, we employ an alter-
native diagnostic. We use the Mass-Excitation (MEx, Juneau
et al. 2011) diagram to study the ionization source in the sample
of confirmed EELGs. Although the MEx diagnostic is generally
less favored compared to other line-ratio methods—since it has
not been thoroughly tested at high-z and is affected by system-
atics in stellar mass estimates (e.g., Coil et al. 2015; Cleri et al.
2023)—we retain it in our analysis because it can be applied to a
large fraction of galaxies in our sample. In Fig. 7, we present the
location of our EELG sample on the MEx diagram, where they
predominantly occupy the SF region, largely avoiding the AGN
regime. We find that their position is consistent with the location
of metal-poor starbursts with high log({O II1]/Hf)z 0.33 — 1.06
(mean value of 0.78). This region is populated by EELGs at z ~ 1
(Amorin et al. 2015) that occupy the same locus with slightly
lower [O III]/H ratios for galaxies with M,2 10°Mo. Similarly,
our sample shows similar [O III]/Hf ratios as the ones of LyC
leakers at low-z at the same stellar mass range. However, we note
that our sample typically spans lower stellar masses compared
to the reference samples. Based on the MEx diagram, we con-
clude that the galaxies in our sample are predominantly powered
by massive stars rather than by AGN. Additionally, no galax-
ies in the sample show an X-ray counterpart within 2arcsec in
the 800-ks Chandra imaging in EGS (Nandra et al. 2015). We
note that, within the redshift range of our sample, the luminos-
ity limit corresponds to Lz-10.k6ev = 10° erg s~!, implying that

fainter AGN may still be present but remain undetected. Overall,
the excitation properties of low-mass EELGs are predominantly
consistent with ionization driven by young starbursts, although
in about 14% of the galaxies an AGN may also contribute to the
ionization.

5.2. Identification of broad-line AGN and stellar outflows

We compared our sample with the literature-based classifica-
tions of broad-line AGN (BLAGN) in the same field (Harikane
et al. 2023; Roberts-Borsani et al. 2024; Brooks et al. 2025; Tay-
lor et al. 2025a; Hviding et al. 2025; Kocevski et al. 2025).
We found that only five galaxies (IDs: 25074, 71325, 81061,
70867, 3391) in our sample are classified as BLAGN. To fur-
ther evaluate whether there are BLAGN in the sample, we mod-
eled the Ha and [O III]+H lines assuming two Gaussians using
LiMe. For the fit, we assume that the second (broad) compo-
nent has a larger velocity width than the first (narrow) compo-
nent, while allowing both components to have independent sys-
temic velocities. Given the spectral resolution of the instrument,
Ha is unresolved for FWHM < 940 — 2600 km s~! (PRISM) and
< 240 — 371 km s~! (MR), depending on redshift. For [O II],
the corresponding FWHM ranges are < 1045 — 4360km s"!
(PRISM) and < 236—410km s~! (MR). We assumed these limits
for the broad component. To evaluate the necessity of the broad
component, we use the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC),
which incorporates both the goodness-of-fit (y?) and the num-
ber of free parameters. To accept the broad emission line in the
model, we require a ABIC > 6 (Fabozzi et al. 2014) and with
S/N > 3.

In the subsample with PRISM spectra, we found that in six
cases the broad component in Ha is accepted, but after a visual
inspection, we found that only in two cases (IDs: 25074, 3391)
is there evidence of a BLAGN in which both components have
similar peak velocities (A ~ 100 — 360km s~'). Regarding the
MR spectra, we found that in nine cases Ha is better modeled
with a broad component, and similarly, after a visual inspection,
in only four cases (IDs: 71325, 75857, 15050, 25074) is there ev-
idence of BLAGN (A ~ 4—70km s~). Importantly, our method-

Article number, page 8 of 21

ology enables us to recover the galaxies previously classified as
BLAGN. We note that source 81061 is not recovered, as it is
classified by Harikane et al. (2023) as a faint AGN with S/N < 3
in the broad component. Source 70867 is also not recovered be-
cause Hf is not covered within the spectral range analyzed in
this paper. The EELGs identified as BLAGN in our sample are
located in the AGN region of the OHNO diagram (Fig. 6) and
in the high-mass regime of the MEx diagram (Fig. 7), consis-
tent with an additional ionization contribution from an AGN in
these galaxies. Moreover, in four galaxies with accepted broad
component—two observed with PRISM (ID: 45212, 47379) and
two with MR (IDs: 75511, 28312)—the broad component is ve-
locity-shifted (A > 360km s~! for PRISM and A > 90km
s-! for MR) relative to the narrow component, which may in-
dicate an outflow rather than a BLAGN. In all the above cases,
[O III] modeling reveals the absence of a broad component.

We identify a subsample of five galaxies (IDs: 66855, 75478,
78647, 47504, 59920) with MR spectra where Ha is not cov-
ered (partially in ID: 75478) and where a broad [O III] compo-
nent is accepted, which may indicate the presence of outflows.
However, no unambiguous outflow signatures are detected in the
EELG sample. Outflows may not be ongoing at the time of ob-
servation but could have previously cleared dust, as suggested by
the AFM. Alternatively, the lack of detection of outflows could
be due to the limited spectral resolution of the PRISM and MR
data; confirming their presence would require follow-up with
higher-resolution spectroscopy and improved sensitivity.

Based on this Gaussian modeling, the lines are well de-
scribed by a single Gaussian, indicating that while BLAGN may
be present, they do not dominate the Balmer line emission. Given
the small fraction of BLAGN in our sample, we do not remove
them from the analysis. Their minimal contribution (< 4%) is
unlikely to significantly impact the statistical properties or over-
all trends of the EELG population. We conclude that massive
stars are the dominant source of ionization in EELGs with-
out significant fractions of BLAGN, although about 14% of the
galaxies are still consistent with an AGN contribution based on
diagnostic diagrams.

6. The contribution of EELGs to cosmic reionization

Several studies indicate that SF galaxies may be the primary
drivers of cosmic reionization (e.g., Finkelstein et al. 2019; Yung
et al. 2020a; Robertson 2022). However, the efficiency with
which these galaxies produced and leaked LyC photons into
the IGM is still poorly constrained. Due to their low metallici-
ties, compact morphologies, and intense radiation fields, EELGs
emerged as promising key players in cosmic reionization (e.g.,
Begley et al. 2025a), given that they could have large &jo, and po-
tentially elevated fescyyc, both of which are crucial parameters
in determining their contribution to reionization. In this section,
we study these two parameters in EELGs to understand their role
during the EoR.

6.1. lonizing photon production efficiency

Ionizing photon production efficiency is a key parameter that
quantifies the number of hydrogen-ionizing photons produced
per unit of UV luminosity. SAMs predict that, due to a
strong metallicity dependency, UV-faint, low-mass galaxies have
€on Values that are up to a factor of 2 higher than those of
more massive galaxies, with the efficiency further enhanced at
higher sSFRs (Yung et al. 2020b). We estimated €ion follow-

We estimate N(H°) using the dust-corrected Ha luminosity as
L(Ha)fergs“!] = 1.36 x 10-!N(H®°)[s~'], which was derived
from Leitherer & Heckman (1995) assuming no ionizing pho-
tons escape from the galaxy and case B recombination. For
fescyc > 0, &on scales by a factor 1/(1-fescyyc).

In Fig. 8, we show the relation between EW([O III])
and €ion. This relation arises because large EWs are typically
linked to young, metal-poor stellar populations, which are ex-
pected to produce copious amounts of hydrogen-ionizing pho-
tons (e.g., Chevallard et al. 2018). We found a mean log(éio,[Hz
erg~!]) = 25.34 for the sample, which is higher than the mean
log(€ion[Hz erg~']) = 25.22 found for the general population of
star-forming galaxies at similar redshift (Llerena et al. 2025)
and also predicted from SAMs at z = 6 — 8 in the same stellar
mass range of the sample with Bruzual & Charlot (2003) models
(Yung et al. 2020b). Our sample follows the relations found in
a wide range of redshifts (e.g., Llerena et al. 2025; Begley et al.
2025b; Pahl et al. 2025) with an increasing éjo9, with increasing
EW((O III]). We note that even in the most extreme EW((O III]),
the &on values do not reach the theoretical limits of log(&ion[Hz
erg~']) = 26 expected for young metal-poor stellar populations
(Raiter et al. 2010; Maseda et al. 2020) and from simulations of
PopllI populations (Lecroq et al. 2025). Therefore, EELGs are
efficient producers of ionizing photons, although they are not the
most efficient ones, as they do not reach the maximum theoreti-
cal values of Eon.

6.2. The escape of Lya photons

Lya@ emission is considered one of the key proxy for LyC es-
cape. At low and intermediate-z, several Lya@ properties (like its
EW or the separation between blue and red peaks) correlate with
LyC leakage, albeit with significant scatter (Marchi et al. 2017;
Izotov et al. 2020; Flury et al. 2022b). In Fig. 9 we show the
relation between EW([O III]+H) and EW(Lya). For this fig-
ure, we considered the subsample of LAEs (circle symbols) and

the non-LAEs subsample with upper limits (triangle symbols).
In the subsample of LAEs, EW(Lya) ranges from 21 to 300 A,
with a median value of 50 A. A subsample of EELGs show high
EW(Lya) 2 100A (24% of the subsample of LAEs).

We compared our results with previous works at z =
2.1 — 3.4 (Tang et al. 2024), and we find that our sample of
LAEs follows the trend of increasing EW(Lya) with increasing
EW([O III]+H£), showing a moderate correlation (p = 0.62, p =
7x 10-8) when including the sample at intermediate-z. Our sam-
ple covers the region of more extreme EW([O III]+H) and con-
sequently higher EW(Lya) compared to LAEs at intermediate-z
(Tang et al. 2024). This increasing trend is also observed in low-z
LyC leakers. We note, however, that Lya emission is not detected
in all EELGs of the sample, with only 18% classified as LAEs.

To quantify the escape fraction of Lya photons (fesc.yq),
we use the flux ratio between Lya and dust-corrected Ha. To
this aim, we considered the theoretical ratio Lya/Ha=8.7 (Hayes
2015). We restrict our analysis to galaxies with z < 7, where the
EGS field has recently been reported to be largely ionized (e.g.,

on Lya@ emission. In our LAE sample, fesciy spans 2% to 55%,
with a median of 14.7%, consistent with the median fescyyq of
18% in the low-z LyC leakers. In Fig. 10 we show the relation of
fesciyg with EW([O III]). A weak correlation is found between
the quantities when including the LzLCS and our LAE samples
(9 = 0.31, p = 1073). Notably, the most extreme EWs in our
LAE sample do not always correspond to elevated fescyyq. Con-
sidering also the upper limits, which in most cases are below
10%, we conclude that the average escape of Lya in EELG is
modest.

6.3. The escape of LyC photons

Given that at the redshift of our EELGs the fescyyc cannot be
measured directly due to the IGM opacity, we estimate it us-
ing models based on multivariate indirect diagnostics (Jaskot
et al. 2024a). In particular we apply the Cox models from Mas-
cia et al. (2025) which are calibrated with galaxies from the
LzLCS survey (Flury et al. 2022a) that exhibit similar properties
to high-z sources and estimate the probability of the detection
of fescyyc as a function of multiple galaxy properties. We con-
sider the revised ELG-O32 Model which estimates fesc_yc from
Mouy, stellar mass, E(B-V), and 032 ratio. In the cases where
032 is not determined in our sources due to low S/N of [O I] or
the wavelength coverage, we consider the revised ELG-EW
Model, which depends on the same indirect parameters but uses
EW([O III]+H) instead of 032. In our sample, O32 values
range from 0.44 to 1.35, with an average of 0.89—exceeding
the 032 = 0.69 threshold commonly observed in strong leak-
ers at low-z (Flury et al. 2022b). Notably, among the 46 galax-
ies with detected [O II] emission, 34 (74%) exhibit 032 ratios
above 0.69. We employed a Monte Carlo approach, perturbing
the model parameters according to their uncertainties to gener-
ate 1000 random realizations. From the resulting distributions of
fesc.yc, we report the median as the best estimate (reported in
Table A.1) and the 16th—84th percentiles as their uncertainties.
In Fig. 11, we show the distribution of fescyyc in the z < 7
subsample. We find a median (mean) value of fesctyc = 4.4%
(11.4%) with values ranging from 0.25% to 89%. In 29% of
the sample, we find fesctyc > 10%. The median value is con-

sistent with the fesc.yc predicted by the AFM at z ~ 5 — 6 (Fer-
rara et al. 2025) and with the median value of 4% from inferred
fesc.yc found in a sample of 436 galaxies at z = 5 — 7 witha
wide range of EW([O III]+H) and using the same methodology
(Mascia et al. 2025). This suggests that, although some EELGs
exhibit elevated fescyyc, most are unlikely to be strong LyC leak-
ers. Moreover, the fesc.yc distribution in EELGs closely follows
that of the general galaxy population at similar redshifts (Mascia
et al. 2025) — not necessarily selected as EELGs — indicating
that EELGs are not particularly more efficient LyC producers
than other galaxies at comparable epochs.

Overall, although some EELGs appear to exhibit high
fescyyq and fesczyc, not all are likely to be strong leakers. Only
9% of the sample shows fescyyq and fescyyc >10%. This is sup-
ported by the absence of Lya emission in several cases and the
fact that the median inferred fescyyc is not particularly elevated.
Coupled with the fact that the EELGs show moderately elevated
€on Values, this highlights the need for a proper estimation of
their contribution to the UV luminosity function to assess their
role in cosmic reionization.

7. The drivers of the high EWs

In this section, we explore the potential physical properties re-
sponsible for the elevated EW([{O III]) observed in our sam-
ple. We examine various properties that could contribute to this
enhancement. Furthermore, we place our findings within the
broader context of galaxies with super-Eddington star-formation.

7.1. Elevated and compact star-formation

In Fig. 12, we show a strong correlation (9 = 0.64, p ~ 0)
between EW((O III]) and sSFR, where the most extreme emit-
ters show elevated sSFR. A similar trend is found with EW(H).
While our sample is limited to high-EW galaxies, this increas-
ing trend has also been reported for lower-EW galaxies at 0.1 <
z < 0.94 (Amorin et al. 2015). Our sample shows more extreme
EWs and sSFRs than low-z LyC leakers, more consistent with
the subsample of strong leakers. The elevated sSFRs seem to be
a potential driver of the high EWs observed in the sample. In

particular, the median sSFR in the sample is 43 Gyr™!, with 16-
84th percentile interval from 24 to 103 Gyr™!, and most of the
galaxies (80%) show sSFR > 25 Gyr~! with high EWs. This is
the threshold for a galaxy to develop a radiation-driven outflow,
ejecting both dust and gas from the system, assuming a compact
effective radius < 200 pc (Ferrara 2024). Our results imply a
fraction of 19% super-Eddington galaxies, based on the parent
sample defined for the photometric selection of EELGs, which
contains 738 galaxies within 5.5 < Zpho < 6.5.

We also analyze a possible relation between EW and galaxy
compactness. To measure the rest-frame UV (ruy) and optical
(Topt) effective radii of the galaxies in our sample, we use the
Galfit catalog v2.0 from the CEERS collaboration (McGrath et
al. in prep.). Galfit (Peng et al. 2002, 2010) was run for sources
with F356W<28.5 mag using background-subtracted mosaics.
To determine ry,,, we considered the effective radius in the filter
F277W, F356W, and F444W for galaxies at z < 6,6 < z < 8,
and z > 8, respectively. For Galfit modeling, we restricted our
analysis to galaxies with a good quality flag (so-called Flag =
0) in the corresponding filter, representing 66% of the total sam-
ple. The ro, are reported in Table A.1. For this subsample, we
also determined ryy considering the effective radius in the filter
F115W and F150W for galaxies at z < 6 and z > 6, respectively.
We found a median ryv/top=0.96.

In Fig. 13 we show the relation between roy, and EW([O III),
which are moderately anti-correlated (90 = —0.37, p = 1.2 x
10-4), with galaxies with the most extreme EWs showing the
most compact sizes. The median roy; is 0.49 kpc with values from
104 pe to 3.70 kpc. Compared to extreme emitters at z = 1.3—3.7
(Tang et al. 2022), our galaxies are more extreme in terms of
EWSs and ro, but they follow the trend observed at lower red-
shifts. We verified that the median ro, of all sources in the Gal-
fit catalog within the same redshift range and quality flag is
0.69 kpc, indicating that EELGs are, on average, more compact
than galaxies at similar redshifts.

Given that these systems show compact effective radii, we

sistent with those estimated using similar methods for EELGs
at z = 0.1 — 0.9 (Calabro et al. 2017). In Fig. 14, we show
that Uspr and EW([O III]) are moderately correlated (9 = 0.50,
p = 4x 10~°), which appears slightly stronger than the corre-
lation with the effective radius. This suggests that the strength
of the [O III] emission is more closely linked to the intensity of
compact star formation than to the overall size of the galaxy.

respond to high gas fractions Seas =

We discuss our results in the context of the AFM model: the
fraction of super-Eddington galaxies in the parent sample (19%)
agrees very well with the expected fraction of 22% predicted by
AFM at z ~ 6 (Ferrara et al. 2025). The small difference may
result from the approximate comparison between spectroscopic
and photometric samples, or from some super-Eddington galax-
ies missed due to extremely low metallicities, which prevent
them from being classified as EELGs (e.g., Laseter et al. 2025).
Galaxies in our sample also show relatively low and moderate
E(B-V) (Fig. 12) as expected by AFM, with the level of dust
clearing depending on the evolutionary phase of the outflow. In-
terestingly, the median fescyc of galaxies with sSFRs>25Gyr"!
is 9%, while for galaxies below is 1.3%, which suggests that
elevated sSFRs enhance fescyyc, in agreement with the AFM
models. Additionally, an enhancement in fescyyc is observed in
galaxies with sSFR > 25 Gyr~! which also have Tor < 200 pe,
with a median fesc,yc=14.7%, while galaxies with sSFR > 25
Gyr"! and ropt > 200 pc, show a median fesctyc=7%.

Overall, elevated sSFRs and compact star-formation activity
appear to drive high EWs. The high sSFRs and small effective
radii, which place them in the super-Eddington regime, lead to an
enhancement of fescyyc with moderate and low E(B-V) values.

the average SFR in the last 3Myr. The red line traces the median values
of burstiness computed in bins of EW, while the shaded region is the
16th-and 84th percentiles.

7.2. Burstiness in EELGs

In this section, we analyze the SFH of EELGs based on the
SED model. Given that SFHs indicate EELGs are experienc-
ing a burst over the last 3 Myr, we investigate their burstiness
by comparing this timescale with a longer period of 100 Myr.
For this analysis, we consider the SFRs obtained from the non-
parametric SED modeling. We estimated the average SFR in
the last 3 Myr and in the last 100 Myr, and the uncertainties
are estimated from the average of the 16th and 84th percentiles
of the SFR distribution. We calculated the burstiness by the
ratio SFR3my:/SFRioomyr Which is shown in Fig. 15. We note
that all EELGs have SFR3myr >SFRioomyr and exhibit a median
log(SFR3myr)-log(SFR joomyr)=1.16 (7 = 0.31), which is an in-
crease in SFR by a factor of 14.6 over the last 3 Myr, indicating
that they are young starbursts. This level of burstiness implies
that, on average, 36% of the stellar mass in EELGs is assembled
within the last 3 Myr. Compared to EW({O III]), we find a mod-
erate correlation (9 = 0.46, p ~ 0) such that galaxies with high
EWs tend to show high SFR3myr/SFR joomyr- Additionally, galax-
ies with high burstiness tend to show high SFR3myr (e = 0.42,
p = 2.6 x 10-). This suggests that EW is regulated not only
by the burstiness of the system but also by the most recent SFR.
An enhancement in the burstiness of a system in galaxies with
elevated EW(Ha) has been found in samples of Ha emitters at
z~ 2 and z ~ 4-6 (Navarro-Carrera et al. 2024), and in low-
mass galaxies 0.7 < z < 1.5 (Atek et al. 2022).

7.3. What are the primary drivers?

To isolate the intrinsic correlation between EW([O III]) and each
parameter explored in Sec. 7.1 and in Sec. 7.2, we performed a
partial Spearman correlation analysis by regressing each vari-
able against the others and correlating the resulting residuals.
This eliminates the influence of the other parameters, enabling
us to evaluate the direct correlations between each variable and
EW((O III]). To this analysis, we use the statsmodels package.
We find that EW([O III]) shows a moderate positive correlation
with both sSFR (o = 0.42, p = 1.3 x 107+) and User (p = 0.41,

Article number, page 12 of 21

p = 2.2 x 10°) even after controlling for the other parameters,
indicating that the EW([O III]) is primarily driven by star forma-
tion activity. In contrast, no significant correlation is found with
effective radius (90 = —0.09, p = 0.43) or burstiness (9 ~ 0,
p = 0.93), suggesting that structural parameters and specific
degree of burstiness have little direct impact on EW({O III]) in
this sample. However, we note that our sample is biased toward
extreme EWs, and the strength of the correlations may change
when including galaxies with lower EWs.

Overall, EELGs exhibit elevated sSFRs and Xspr. These
properties suggest that intense star formation activity occurring
within small spatial scales may be a key factor driving their ex-
treme EWs. Additionally, high levels of burstiness, indicated by
elevated SFR3myr/SFRioomyr ratios, might further enhance the
EWs, although our partial correlation analysis shows that sSFR
and Usrp are the primary drivers, while burstiness has no signif-
icant independent effect.

8. Summary and conclusions

We analyzed a sample of 160 EELGs at z ~ 4—9, including 127
observed with NIRSpec/PRISM and 81 with NIRSpec/G395M,
drawn from the CAPERS, CEERS, and RUBIES surveys. These
galaxies were initially identified as EELG candidates from NIR-
Cam photometry (Llerena et al. 2024). Our results can be sum-
marized as follows:

i) We found a high success rate of 89% for the selection criteria
proposed in Llerena et al. (2024) to identify EELGs at z ~
4-9 with EW((O III]+H)> 680A. In the confirmed extreme
EELGs, the median EW({OIII]+H@)=1616A and the median
EW(Ha)=763A. Photometric redshifts are confirmed with a
mean difference Zpnor — Zspec = 0.13.

ii) EELGs show a median log(M,/M.)=8.26 and are scattered
above the main-sequence of SF galaxies at z ~ 6 based
on the Balmer-derived SFRs. They show a wide range of

E(B — V) ~ 0 — 0.46 with no correlation with EW([O III).

They also show a wide range of 6 slopes with a mean B =

—2.0. Only 7% of EELGs have super-blue 6 slopes < —2.6

that are bluer than the limit set by SF + nebular continuum,

however, this fraction is not significant at the 1c level.

Emission-line diagnostics (OHNO, MEx diagrams) sug-

gest that massive stars are the dominant ionizing source in

EELGs. An AGN contribution cannot be fully excluded in

14% of the sample, and evidence for BLAGN is found in a

small fraction (4%) of the sample.

EELGs are efficient producers of ionizing photons with a

mean log(€ionf{Hz erg-']) =25.34, which is slightly higher

than the mean value found for SF galaxies at similar
redshift. However, the escape of LyC photons, indirectly
inferred from Cox models, is not particularly efficient.

Only 9% of EELGs show high escape fractions of both

Lya and LyC photons, while most (71%) are likely not

strong leakers (fesctyc<10%). This is supported by the lack

of Lya emission in 82% of the sample and the fact that
the median inferred fesctyc=4.4% is not particularly ele-
vated. However, the escape of LyC photons is enhanced in

EELGs with sSFR>25Gyr7! and Topt<200 pe with a median

v) EELGs exhibit very high sSFRs, with a median value of
43Gyr"!, along with very high Uspr, with a median value
of 10.7 Mo yr! kpc~ and compact rop, with a median of
0.49 kpc. These properties suggest that intense star formation
activity occurring within small spatial scales may be a key

factor driving their extreme EWs. Additionally, high bursti-
ness, traced by the ratio SFR3y,/SFRioomyr, might enhance
the observed EWs. However, sSFR and Xsrr are likely to be
the primary drivers.

Overall, EELGs are low-mass systems characterized by el-
evated and compact star formation with a recent burst. They
are efficient producers of ionizing photons; however, while
a subset of the population exhibits high escape fractions of
Lya and LyC photons, they are not uniformly strong leakers with
fesc.yc > 10%. This may be attributed to the presence of dust
within the ISM, as suggested by the relatively moderate (i.e., not
extremely blue) UV continuum slopes observed in the sample
since 8 seems to be an important indicator of fesctyc (Chisholm
et al. 2022; Giovinazzo et al. 2025). Notably, in compact super-
Eddington galaxies, the escape of LyC photons is enhanced.

Appendix A: Summary of properties in the sample

In Table A.1, we provide information about the galaxies in the
sample. We report their identification ID from the CEERS pho-
tometric catalog and their spectroscopic ID (Spec ID) in each
survey. We report their coordinates, the corresponding spectro-
scopic survey and disperser, spectroscopic redshifts, rest-frame
EWSs of bright emission lines (Hf, [O III], and Ha), E(B—V) from
SED modeling, sSFRs, 8 slopes, Muy, rest-frame optical effec-
tive radius, and the inferred fescyyc from the Cox models. The
AGN candidates based on the OHNO diagram shown in Sec.
5.1 are marked with a *. The EELGs in the sample classified as
BLAGN in Sec. 5.2 are marked with a *.

Appendix B: Median spectrum of EELGs

To show the typical spectral features of EELGs, we constructed
a median stacked spectrum of all 127 galaxies in our sample with
PRISM observations. The stacking was performed using a non-
weighted approach. Each individual spectrum was first shifted to
the rest-frame using its spectroscopic redshift and then interpo-
lated onto a common wavelength grid between 1000 and 7000 A
and considering the median redshift of the sample, z = 5.2. The
spectra were subsequently normalized to the median flux within
the 2700-2800 A range. At each wavelength, the final stacked
flux density was computed as the median of the individual flux
densities, applying a 3-0 clipping to exclude outliers.

The 1-o uncertainty on the stacked spectrum was estimated
via bootstrap resampling: for each wavelength, the median flux
was recalculated for 1000 random resamplings of the individ-
ual spectra, and the standard deviation of these medians was
taken as the error. The resulting stacked spectrum is presented
in Fig. B.1, where we indicate the positions of prominent emis-
sion lines, many of which are analyzed in detail in this paper.
This approach allows us to highlight the typical spectral features
of the EELG population.

We perform a similar approach with the 81 galaxies in the
sample with MR spectra. In this case, we considered a common
wavelength grid between 3600 and 7000 A and considering the
median redshift of the sample, z = 5.2. The individual spec-
tra were normalized to the median flux within the 5100-6400 A
range. The resulting spectrum is shown in Fig. B.2.

Appendix C: SFRs from Balmer lines

In Fig. C.1, we show the comparison between the SFR ob-
tained from SED fitting (average in the last 10 Myr) and
from Balmer lines. We find a good agreement (9 = 0.84,
p ~ 0) between both parameters with a median log(SFR \omyr)-
log(SFRgaimer)=—0.15 dex(a = 0.25 dex). This indicates that
Balmer lines are tracers of the average SFR in the last 1OMyr in
our sample.

Appendix D: £ from photometry vs spectra

In Fig. D.1, we show the difference in the UV £ slopes using
the methods described in Sec. 3.4 where we estimate 6 using the
spectra or the photometry. These differences have been found in
other works (e.g., Morales et al. 2025) when using only spec-
tra or photometry to estimate the 8 slopes. We note that no
wavelength-dependent correction was applied to the spectral flux
calibration in this study. This choice is motivated by our finding
that, on average, the correction factor remains consistent across
all available filters, indicating that a single scaling provides a
satisfactory match between photometric and spectroscopic mea-
surements. Nevertheless, we cannot fully rule out a subtle wave-
length dependence of the correction, which could contribute to
some of the observed discrepancies between f estimated using
spectra or photometry.

Appendix E: EW of bright emission lines

In Fig. E.1 we show the comparison between EW([O III]) and
EW(H§). We find that galaxies exhibiting high EW([O III]) also
tend to show correspondingly high EWs in the Balmer lines. This
strong correlation (0 = 0.78, p ~ 0) suggests a common source
of ionization for both [O III] and the Balmer emission, most

likely originating from intense star-forming activity. Our find-
ings are consistent with recent results from the JADES survey,
which examined EELGs over 3 < z < 9.5 and reported similar
EW behavior (Boyett et al. 2024). Furthermore, we note that a
similar EW([{O III])—EW(Hf) relationship has been observed in
LyC leakers at z ~ 0.3, where the emission line strengths are
comparable to those in our EELG sample.

Appendix F: Comparison between PRISM and MR
measurements

In Fig. F.1 we show a comparison between the observed fluxes
(top panel) and EWs (bottom panel) in the subsample of galax-
ies that have PRISM and MR spectra. Regarding the observed
fluxes, we find a very strong correlation (9 = 0.95, p ~ 0) be-
tween the fluxes measured in the PRISM and the MR spectra for
[O III], Ha and H£. We notice, however, that the fluxes measured
in the PRISM spectra tend to be slightly higher than those mea-
sured in the MR spectra, with a median difference of 0.06 dex
(o = 0.14). Comparing the EWs of the same lines, we also find
a very strong correlation (9 = 0.95, p ~ 0) with a median dif-
ference of 0.06 dex (a = 0.17) between the EWs measured from
the PRISM and the MR spectra. This larger offset and scatter re-
flect the limitations in determining the faint continuum level in
these galaxies.
