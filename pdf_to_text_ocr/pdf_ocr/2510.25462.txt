Action-minimizing periodic orbits of the Lorentz force equation
with dominant vector potential

Abstract

We establish the existence of non-constant periodic solutions to the Lorentz force equation, where
no scalar potential is needed to induce the electromagnetic field. Our results extend to cases where a
possibly singular scalar potential is present, although the vector potential assumes a leading role. The
approach is based on minimizing the action functional associated with the relativistic Lagrangian. The
compactness of the minimizing sequences requires the existence of negative values for the functional,
which is proven using novel ideas that exploit the sign-indefinite nature of the term involving the vector
potential.

Keywords: Lorentz force equation; non-constant periodic solutions; Maxwell’s equations; relativistic La-
grangian; action minimization; dominant vector potential.

1 Introduction

The Lorentz force equation models the relativistic dynamics of a slowly accelerated charged particle in an
electromagnetic field. In this context, let q(t) : [0,T] + R° denote the position of the particle at time t,
and let q(t) denote its velocity. The electric and magnetic fields are represented by E : [0,T] x U > R?
and B : [0,T] x U > R’, respectively, with U C R® an open set. For simplicity, and without loss of
generality, we normalize both the speed of light in vacuum and the charge-to-mass ratio to one. Under
these assumptions, the system under consideration takes the form

existence of non-constant periodic solutions for the Lorentz force equation only has been established in [2,
Theorem 10}, [4, Theorem 3.7] and [11, Theorem 1].

The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the hypotheses on the potentials
and state the main results. Section 3 is devoted to establishing a minimization result, conditional on the
existence of negative values of the action functional. Section 4 includes the proof of Theorem 2.1, which
focuses on the minimization of the action functional in the absence of a scalar potential. In Section 5, we
prove Theorem 2.2 and Theorem 2.3, which extend Theorem 2.1 to more general settings where a scalar
potential is present but controlled by a vector potential. In Section 6, we discuss about the necessity of the
assumptions made throughout the paper. Finally, the Appendix provides an uniform a priori bound for
|q| in Equation (1) in the non-singular regime, which shows that there cannot exist a sequence of periodic
solutions whose velocity approaches the speed of light in vacuum.

2 Hypotheses and main results

As previously mentioned, our interest lies in the role of the vector potential in the existence of periodic
trajectories of charged particles. To this end, we begin by considering electromagnetic fields in (3) with
® = 0, which reduces Equation (1) to

dt \ /1=14P

After fixing T > 0, we begin by stating our first main result, which establishes the existence of periodic
solutions of (4) for a large class of electromagnetic fields uniquely determined by a vector potential A €

C1(R*; RS).

Theorem 2.1. Let A € C! (R*; R’) be non-autonomous, T-periodic in its first variable, and with uniformly

and

Then the Lorentz force equation (4) possesses at least one non-constant periodic solution q. Moreover,

for some p € (0,1) independent of q.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on the existence of closed trajectories of a charged
particle in the relativistic regime of the Lorentz force equation (1), where the dynamics is completely
independent of the scalar potential, since ® is identically zero. We also emphasize that the solutions are
non-constant, as noted previously in the Introduction.

To simplify notation, we define the family A of vector potentials satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem 2.1,

A:= {A€C!(R*;R’) : A satisfies (5) and (6)}.

Since our analysis also covers the general case ® ¥ 0, including non-smooth regimes, in what follows we
fix a compact set S C R* representing the set of singularities of ®, which may be empty. Moreover, we
define its complement by S° := R°\ S.
Definition 2.1. We define the family of scalar potentials P as the set of functions

such that
for all (t,x) € R x S® with |a — xo], |t — to| <e. (8)

Observe that the case S = () includes the setting of Theorem 2.1. In this situation, the electromagnetic
field in (4) is assumed to be continuous in R*, periodic in time, and with uniformly in time decay at infinity.
In the general case, the set S may consist of a finite union of points or, more generally, compact subsets of
R®, where the singularities of the field are governed by Coulomb’s law. Furthermore, the decay conditions
(6) and (7) are necessary to ensure uniqueness of solution to Maxwell’s equations in the distributional
sense [10, 12], thereby omitting the appearance of electromagnetic radiation phenomena [16, 15]. Hence,
the electromagnetic fields described through A x P have a natural sense from both mathematical and
physical points of view.

Nevertheless, a direct computation shows that any two pairs of potentials related by the transformation
(1, Ai) = (2 + :f, 42 - Vf), for some f € C1(R4;R), (9)

generate the same field through (3), thereby describing the same dynamics in Equation (1). This is the
well-known Lorenz gauge condition of the potentials, adapted to our framework, which naturally induces
the identification of a pair (®, A) with its equivalence class in the quotient space induced by (9).

Definition 2.2. We define the set (A x P) / ~ of the equivalence classes of the pairs (A,®) € Ax P
through the relation ~, that is

(®,, A) ~ (®2, Az) & (8, — Ba, Ar — Av) = (Of,-Vf), for some f € C'(R*;R).

We clarify that, whenever we take an element in A x P/ ~, we implicitly choose a representative within
its equivalence class. Thus, we will abuse of the notation and simply write (A,®) € (A x P)/~.

Since our analysis focuses on the purely relativistic dynamics of (1), it is necessary to exclude magne-
tostatic configurations. More concretely, by Maxwell’s equations, the absence of electric field yields the
magnetic field to be time-independent necessarily. In particular, it is straightforward to prove that the mod-
ulus |q(t)| is conserved in Equation (1) when E = 0 and B(t,q) = B(q). As a consequence, the Lorentz force
equation (1) reduces to a second-order Newton—Lorentz equation, thereby losing its relativistic character.

Given these clarifications, we establish the family of potential (A, @) under consideration.
Definition 2.3. The set AP of admissible potentials is defined as follows
AP := {(A,®) € (Ax P)/-~, such that 0A+V® FO}.

Recall from (3) that the elements in AP generate a non-zero electric field. Moreover, since every element
in (Ax P)/ ~ gives rise to the same electric field, the set AP is well-defined. In addition, observe that the
condition 0,A + V® # 0 is automatically satisfied whenever S 4 (), since A is smooth on S.

Finally, we stress that the elements of P can be considered to have non-positive mean value. Specifically,
for each ® € P, let us define the function y : S© + R as follows:

4
Since ® is bounded from above, it follows that the function y has finite supremum. Then, the potential 6

and (A, 6) ~ (A, ®), for all A € A. Therefore, from now on we shall assume without loss of generality that

sup y(a) = 0. (11)
aEeS©

We emphasize on the dichotomy regarding whether the mean value function y(«), defined in (10), attains
its supremum (11) or not. In fact, when y does not attain a maximum, it must necessarily decay to zero
at infinity, i.e.

We then state our second result, which generalizes Theorem 2.1.

Theorem 2.2. Let (A,®) € AP be such that, for some sequence {b,} C R° with |b, | + 00 as n - 00, the
function

and
lim max{|V@(t,y)| +t € [0,7], |yl > [bn] — THAC, bn)lla* = 0. (15)

Then, the Lorentz force equation (1) possesses at least one non-constant periodic solution q. Moreover,
when S = 0),
Wldllo <p,
for some p € (0,1) independent of q.
Intuitively, conditions (14) and (15) require, at least in one direction, the decay of both the mean value
and the gradient of ®(t,7) to be faster than the decay of the oscillations of A(t,x). These hypotheses

represent the first instance in the literature, to our knowledge, where the scalar potential ® is effectively
controlled by the vector field A, revealing the novelty of our approach.

On the other hand, note that if the decay condition (12) does not hold, then the function y attains its
maximum. In this setting, let @ € P and b € S° be such that

and let Ma C S° be the set of points satisfying (16), ie.

The following result addresses a complementary regime to that considered in Theorem 2.2. While the

Then, the Lorentz force equation (1) possesses at least one non-constant periodic solution q. Moreover,

for some p € (0,1) independent of q.

We conclude the section with some remarks analyzing notable cases where Theorems 2.2 and 2.3 are
applicable.

Remark 2.1. Suppose that A has compact support in x, independent of t, say K C R®. Also assume that
there exists another compact set Ko CC K such that

p(x) =0, and max{|V&(t,y)|:t € [0,7], |y| > |a]|—T}=0, for all a € R?\ Ko. (18)

This situation can be interpreted as a limiting case of Theorem 2.2, where A still governs the behavior of
®, since, roughly speaking, © must vanish at infinity before A does. However, Theorem 2.2 is not directly
applicable, because the zero sets of yp and A intersect at infinity, so conditions (14) and (15) are ill-defined.
Nevertheless, from the condition on V@ in (18), it follows that V®(t,x) = 0 for all x € R® \ Ko. On the
other hand, by the definition of support, we have 0,A(-,2) # 0 for all x € K. This implies that

VO&(.,2) =OF GA(-,z), for alla e K \ Ko.

At the same time, y(x) = 0 for all  € K \ Ko. Therefore, Theorem 2.3 applies in this case.

Remark 2.2. A neat particular case that combines both Theorem 2.2 and Theorem 2.3 is the case of ®
being autonomous. Indeed, let (A, ®) € AP be such that ® does not depend on ¢, so that y(x) = T®(x) < 0.
Thus, if there exists b € S© such that

®(b)=0, OA(-,b) #0,
then V®(b) = 0 ¥ 0,A(-,x), and Theorem 2.3 yields the existence of a non-constant periodic solution to

we deduce from Theorem 2.2 that, again, a non-constant periodic solution to (1) exists.

3 Minimization of the action functional

The purpose of this section is to prove, under natural conditions, the existence of a non-constant minimizer
of the action functional associated to the relativistic Lagrangian (2). In the language of Classical Mechanics,
this amounts to proving a principle of least action. The results discussed in the first two subsections are
essentially established in [2, 4], we include them here to keep the exposition self-contained. In contrast, the
third subsection constitutes the novelty of our approach, see Remark 3.2.

3.1 Functional framework
Let W be the following Banach space

W={q:R> R®, Lipschitz and T-periodic}
endowed with the norm
llallw := llalla.co = Ilalloo + [ldlloc; for all ge W.
Consider also the subset
K={qeW: |ldllo <1},

which is convex and closed in W [2, Lemma 3.1].

Throughout the paper, we will frequently make use of the standard decomposition W = We R?, where

rT
W={qeWw: G=0}, with i-z/ q(t)dt,
0

so that every q € W can be uniquely written as

q= +4. (19)
This framework allows to use both the classical Poincaré-Wirtinger inequality:
me 2 +12
qalldll < lldll2, for every qe W, (20)
and the estimate
lll <T, forallqeK, (21)

which follows directly from the (integral version of) the mean value theorem.

For any © € P, let us define the non-singular set
A={qeEWw: (gq) > -oco}, and Kya=KNA, (22)

where we have considered the obvious extension of the non-positive function y, defined in (10), to the whole
space W. In particular, A = W when S = (). Moreover, if S 4 0, we note that every g € W for which there
exists to € R such that q(to) € S satisfies, by condition (8), that

la) — aloo”

for some 6 > 0 small enough. This inequality, together with the fact that q is Lipschitz, lead to the
conclusion that the non-singular set (22) can equivalently be written as

—@(t, q(t) > for all t € [to — 6,to + 4],

A={qeEw: q(t) ZS, for all t € R},

as defined in [4] for S = {0}. This shows that A does not depend on ®. In any case, it is simple to check
that A is an open subset of W.

In this setting, the action functional Z : A — (—oo, co] associated to (1) is defined by

T T
[ (-viste)as [ @-Ata-eeaa, itgeks,
x(a) =4 Jo 0 (23)

It is standard to decompose the functional as J = UV + F, where

0
and
7
Fa) = f° G-Alta)~ (9) dt, for all ge A. (25)
Jo

It is straightforward to verify that the functional F is of class C!. Moreover, it is well-known that U : W >
(—o0, oo] is a convex, proper functional with closed domain K C W. In particular, Y is continuous on K
and lower semi-continuous on the whole space W.
Remark 3.1. As commented in the Introduction, the structure of Z is a particular instance of Szulkin’s
functionals [19]. The situation S = 9 was rigorously established in [2], corresponding to the setting of
continuous electromagnetic fields. Furthermore, the case S = {0} is analyzed in [4, 5], which describes
an electric field with an isolated Coulomb-type singularity and a continuous magnetic field. This case was
later generalized in [8] for singularities depending on the time variable, aiming to model the dynamics
induced by moving particles through the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. In our work, we choose not to
extend the analysis to traveling point singularities, for the sake of simplicity. However, we believe that
our results should remain valid in that framework, provided the moving singularities are controlled by a
time-dependent version of Coulomb’s law analogous to (8).

In this non-smooth setting, critical points are defined as follows.

Definition 3.1. A point qg € Ky is said to be critical for TZ if it satisfies the following inequality:
Up) — Vi) + F'(O[p—q 20, for allp € Ka.

An argument analogous to that of [2, Theorem 6] shows that a function q € W solves (1) if and only if q
is a critical point for the functional (23). Moreover, it follows directly from the convexity of U that every
local minimizer of T is necessarily a critical point of the functional, see [19, Proposition 1.1].

Critical points that are not minimizers are typically obtained via min-max variational methods. In
the literature of min-max theory, establishing the compactness of Palais-Smale sequences is usually a
challenging task. In fact, proving a suitable compactness of Palais-Smale sequences (in the Szulkin’s sense)
for min-max results applied to the Lorentz force equation was one of the main contributions of [2]. In
the present paper, however, our approach is based on direct minimization, and thus we avoid dealing with
Palais-Smale sequences or min-max methods. Nonetheless, compactness issues still arise in our framework.

To illustrate this, consider the case where S = §), and take the functional (23) with A = 0, that is,

L(q) = Y(q) — (4).

Since y < 0, it follows that Z(q) > 0 for all ¢ € W. Now, suppose further that limj,|.0 (2) = 0. Then,
for any sequence {z,,} C R® with |z,,| + oo, we have Z(x,) — 0. Hence, there exist minimizing sequences
that do not converge. We will show that introducing a non-autonomous vector potential A provides the
desired compactness.

3.2 Semicontinuity property of the action functional
The following result establishes an intrinsic compactness property of the set K.
Lemma 3.1. Let {q,} CK be bounded in L®. Then, there exists q € K such that, up to a subsequence,

Gn 24; strongly in L®, (26)
Gn > Gin the weak-* topology o(L®, L'). (27)

Proof. First, the sequence {q,} is bounded in W1, and hence also bounded in the Sobolev space H?.
Consequently, there exists ¢ € H! such that, up to a not relabeled subsequence,

Mr 4, weakly in Ht. (28)
Moreover, by the compact embedding W1:° <> C, there exists p € C such that, up to a further subsequence,
\lGn — Plloo — 0.

In particular, this implies pointwise convergence, and hence p is T-periodic. Furthermore, ||gn — p||2 + 0,
so that q, — p weakly in L?. In view of (28), we deduce that p = q, which establishes (26).
Now we apply the Banach—Alaoglu-Bourbaki theorem. Since ||g@n||.. < 1 for all n, there exists p € L©
such that, up to a further subsequence,

Gn ~ p, in the weak-* topology o(L®, L').
This trivially implies that ¢,, + p weakly in L?. Recalling (28), we conclude that p = q, which proves (27).

Finally, since the L°°-norm is lower semicontinuous with respect to the convergence (27), it follows that
\ldlloo < 1, and thus q € K.

Let us recall that the functional UV : W —- R defined in (24) is lower semicontinuous with respect to
the L° norm [7, Proposition 1], and consequently also with respect to the Wh° norm. Moreover, the
functional F, defined in (25), is of class C! with respect to the W'° norm. The following result provides
a kind of lower semicontinuity property of Z with respect to the convergences (26) and (27).

Lemma 3.2. Let {qn} C Ka be a sequence bounded in L™, and let q € Kx. Assume that (26) and (27)
hold. Then, for any compact set S C R® and any pair (A,®) € AP, the following holds:

F(q) = Jim F(an), Z(a) < limin Z(4n)- (29)

noo

Proof. First, using regularity of A together with the convergences (26) and (27), we obtain

T T
i Gn A(t, qn)dt > i q: A(t, q)dt. (30)
0 0

Moreover, since &(t,-) € C1(S°;R), (26) implies

i T
[ B(t,qn)dt > | H(t, q)dt,
0 0

which establishes
jim, F(dn) = F(9)-

Finally, the lower semicontinuity of UV with respect to the L°-norm yields

T(q) < liminf Z(q,),
noo

thus proving (29).

Motivated by the previous lemma, one may ask whether every sequence in K, that converges in the sense
of (26)-(27) has its limit also lying in Ky. This is indeed the case, provided the action functional remains
bounded along the sequence. This idea originates from [4, Lemma 3.2], even though our result is valid for
slightly more general singular sets. The precise statement is the following.

Lemma 3.3. Let {qn} C Ka be a sequence satisfying (26)-(27) for some q EK. Let S C R® be a compact
set, and let (A,®) € AP. Assume that {Z(qn)} is bounded. Then, q € Ka.

Proof. Recall that (26)-(27) are enough to assure (30). Then, given that {Z(qn)} is bounded, we deduce

T

a”
—elan) == f ®(tan(t))at = (an) ~ Was) — fda Altran(t))at < ©.

for some constant C' > 0. Thus, since —® > 0, we may apply Fatou lemma, leading to

4 3 i i
-y(q) =- [ ®(t,q(t))dt <liminf | (—®(t,¢qn(t)))dt < C,

noo Jo

where —®(t,q(t)) = liminf,,..(—®(t, qn(t))). Therefore, y(q) > —oo, and thus, g € Ky, as defined in
(22).

3.3. Compactness of minimizing sequences

It is remarkable that the decay condition (6) ensures that the term involving the vector potential in Z
vanishes at infinity, even if A itself does not (actually, A could be growing at logarithmic rate). This
statement is made rigorous in the following lemma.

Lemma 3.4. Let A € A, and let {qn} CK be a sequence with lim |G| = co. Then,

| Gn: A(t, dn)dt = [ Gn (Al, dn) — A(t Gn) at +f Gn A(t, Gn)dt. (32)
0 0 0

We start by estimating the first term on the right-hand side of (32). To do so, note that for every t € [0,T]
and every n, there exists s;,(t) € [0,1] such that

|A(t, an(t)) — A(t, In)| S [VA(E, Sn (t)an(t) + (1 = Sn(t))an)|lQn (4) — In
Then,

T T
[ din (A(t, dn) — Alt, dn))at] < [ [VA(E, sn (t)an(t) + (1 — Sn(t))dn) Ilan lat (33)

Hence, bearing (21) in mind, and observing that
[Sn (t)dn(t) + (1 — Sn(#))Gn)| 2 ldn| — nl 2 lanl — T,

we conclude from (33) and (6) that

lim =0.

Concerning the second term in (32), integrating by parts yields

Therefore, again (21) and (6) lead to

The proof is complete.

In the line of Lemma 3.4, next result shows a vanishing property of the difference (gn) — (Gn) at
infinity.

Lemma 3.5. Let ® € P, and let {qn} C Ka be a sequence with lim |G,| = 00. Then,

Proof. For any t € [0,T] and any n, consider a point in the segment joining g,(t) with Gn, ie. sqn(t) +
(1 —s)@n for some s € [0,1]. Then, as in the proof of Lemma 3.4, we have

|sqn(t) + (1 — 8)Gn| 2 |Gnl - T. (34)

This means that, for n large enough independent of t, any point in the segment belongs to S°, since S is
bounded. Therefore, the mean value theorem can be applied to obtain some s,,(t) € [0,1] such that

B(t, gn(t)) — O(t, Gn) = VO(t, $n (t)dn(t) + (1 — Sn(t))Gn) » Gn(t).
Hence,

oe TT
[ (®(¢, dn) — ®(t,@)) dt| <T i [VO(E, sn (t)qn(t) + (1 — Sn(t))an)ldt.

Finally, (34) and condition (7) yield the result.

A direct consequence of Lemma 3.4 and Lemma 3.5 is that Z is bounded from below, as stated by the
following result.

Lemma 3.6. For any (A,®) € AP, the action functional I : A + R is bounded from below.

Proof. Given e > 0, Lemma 3.4 and Lemma 3.5, together with the fact that y is non-positive at the
constants, yield the existence of R > 0 such that

i T
Ha) = va) + fd Altayat - i (®(¢,q) — 8.) dt — og) > -<,

for all q € Ky with |q| > R. On the other hand, if g € Ky satisfies |g] < R, then (21) implies that
lldlloo < T+ R, and therefore,

Z(q) > —T max{|A(¢,x)|: t € [0,T], |z| <T + R},

for all g € Ka such that |g| < R. In any case, ZT is bounded from below.

The previous lemma yields the existence of minimizing sequences in K,. In view of the semi-continuity
property of the action proved in Lemma 3.2, it only remains to prove a suitable compactness result for the
minimizing sequences in order to apply the direct method of the calculus of variations.

We finish the section by stating and proving a principle of least action which ensures the compactness
of the minimizing sequences provided that the action attains negative values.

Theorem 3.1. Let (A,®) € AP satisfy that inf Z(q) <0. Then, there exists a non-constant q € Ka such
qe!
that I = minZ(q).
at T(q) = min Z(q)

Remark 3.2. Let us highlight that [2, Theorem 7] establishes a similar principle of least action for the
action functional in the setting of continuous electromagnetic fields. Nevertheless, our approach extends
this principle by allowing the presence of singularities in the scalar potential (hence in the electromagnetic
field) and by identifying the key condition of a negative infimum of the action. We also stress that the
negativity of the infimum not only ensures the compactness of the minimizing sequences, but also guarantees
that all critical points are non-constant, since Z(q) > 0 for every q € R®.

As discussed in the Introduction, proving the existence of non-constant periodic solutions to the Lorentz
force equation has been a challenging task in previous works, with only a few results available on the
subject.

11
Proof of Theorem 3.1. By Lemma 3.6, we can consider a minimizing sequence {qn} CK, such that

L(an) + c= inf Z(q) < 0.
qed

Moreover, the non-negativity of — y|zs and V, together with Lemma 3.4 and Lemma 3.5, trivially lead to

lim Z(pp) = lim (V(pn) — Y(Pn)) >0>c, for all {pn} CK with lim ||pp||oo = 00.
noo noo noo

Therefore, the sequence ||qp||o0 is uniformly bounded, and thus satisfies the convergences from (26) and

(27) to some q € K. In fact, by Lemma 3.3, we have that q € Ka. Finally, by Lemma 3.2, the lower

semi-continuity of Z under these convergences gives that

noo

Z(q) < lim T(qn) = inf Z(9) <T(q).

This concludes the proof.

4 Existence of minimizer when ® = 0

In this section we prove Theorem 2.1, which corresponds with the particular case of continuous electro-
magnetic fields in the absence of scalar potential in (3).

As previously commented, the set A defined in (22) trivially coincides with the whole space W when
® = 0. Therefore, the action functional Zp : W — (—co, ov] associated with Equation (4) is defined as

follows:
T fa
[ (1 _/1- ia?) a+ [ q-Alt,qdt, if eK,
0 0

00, ifgeW\K,

where the smooth part (25) of Zp becomes now

Zo(q) =

Tr
Fo(q) = [ q: A(t,q)dt, for allg eW.

In this setting, we show that the functional Zp attains negative values whenever the vector potential A(t, x)
belongs to the class A. By Theorem 3.1, this guarantees the existence of a non-constant q € K that is
a global minimize of Zp, and therefore a critical point. As a result, since q € K is a periodic solution
of (4), the uniform bound ||q|lo. < p < 1 is a direct consequence of Lemma A.1 in the Appendix. After
this argument, Theorem 2.1 becomes an immediate consequence of the next key lemma on the existence of
negative values.

Lemma 4.1. For any A € A there exists a point p € K such that Io(p) < 0.

Proof. We begin by recalling that A is globally Lipschitz continuous in x, uniformly in t. Specifically, given
A € A there exists a finite number M > 0 such that

|A(t, x) — A(t,y)| < M|x—y|, for every t € [0,T], 2,y € R’, (35)

where

M =||VAG,2)|| be). (36)

Next, since 0,A # 0, there exists b € R® such that the function A(-,b) : [0,7] > R is non-constant.
Recalling the notation (19), let us take the primitive

t
g(t) = [ A(s, b)ds, for every tE R. (37)
0

12
Obviously we have that g € W with non-trivial derivative g # 0. In particular,
A(t, b) = g(t), for all t € [0,7].

On the other hand, we also define
p=-eg+b, foralle >0, (38)
where € can be chosen sufficiently small to ensure that p € K. Then,

tS ie ft .
[ v-atenyar= f° p-(aten) - At8) + a)ae= [ p-(Aley) - ACG) dt el:

Moreover, using the Lipschitz condition (35)-(36), we proceed as follows:

c a T
| i p: (A(t, p) — A(t, b))dt| = € | 9: (A(t,p) — A(t, b)) dt} < eu | lgilp — blade

where the last step follows directly from the Poincaré-Wirtinger inequality (20).

Finally, since

we deduce that

Hence, we obtain that Zo(p) < 0 for all sufficiently small e > 0.

5 Extensions to ® #0 with dominant vector potential

Similarly to Theorem 2.1, in this section we prove both Theorem 2.2 and Theorem 2.3 as consequences of
minimizing the associated action functional Z from (23) via the application of Theorem 3.1 at each case.
Moreover, as commented in Section 4, the existence of an uniform bound p € (0,1) for the derivative of
the minimizer when S = 0) follows directly from the Lemma A.1 in the Appendix.

In what follows we fix a compact subset S C R%. Let us also recall the function y : S° + R defined in
(10), ice.

a
y(z) = [ O(t,x)dt, with ®eEP,
0

which is non-positive.
After these remarks, Theorem 2.2 follows directly from the next result.

Proposition 5.1. Let (A,®) € AP satisfy conditions (13), (14) and (15), for some sequence {bn} C R®
with lim |bn| = 00. Then there exists q € Ka such that I(q) <0.
n-¥00

Proof. Let {b,} C S° be the sequence with lim,_,, |b,| = co given by the statement. Similarly to (37),
let us define the periodic function gn € W as follows

t
Galt) = | A(s, bn)ds, for alln EN.
0

Recall that A(t, bn) is non-constant for all n € N, and so

gn(t) = A(t, bn) #0, for alln EN.

13
Additionally, for ¢ > 0, let py be defined analogous to (38):
Pn =—€Gntbn, for allneN.
Since A(t, bn) € W, for all n €N, it follows that

max |A(t,bn)| < T||A(t, ©)\|b~(r4) < TM, for alln EN,
te[0,T]

where M is given in (36). Therefore, the sequence of norms ||g,,||. is uniformly bounded, and ¢ > 0 can
be chosen sufficiently small so that pn € K for all n € N. Consequently, proceeding as in the proof of
Lemma 4.1, we obtain the inequality

MT rt
L(pn) < —ellgnll3 (1 “ aN) a [ O(t,pr)dt, for alln € N, (40)
0

which trivially reduces to (39) when ® = 0. Hence, we now focus on estimating the term involving ®.
First, notice that, for any s € [0,1], we have

|spp(t) + (1 8)Bn| > [onl —eldnl, for all n EN.
Then, recalling that
lGnlloo S T||Gnlloo, and €|\Gniloo <1, for alln EN,

it follows that
|spn(€) + (L—8)bn| > |bn| — T. (41)

In particular, for all n large enough, independent of t, every point in the segment joining p,,(t) to b, belongs
to S°. Thus, by the mean value theorem there exists s,,(t) € [0,1] such that

au T
[ (®(t, pn) — B(t, bn) dt] < ef |Gn||V®(t, 8n()pn + (1 — Sn(t))bn)|dt

z

€L i. a
< — IGuall2 (/ |VO(t, 5n(t)pn + (1 — Sn(t))bn)|? a)
Jo
where (20) is used in the last step. As a consequence, recalling (41), we deduce

r eT?
[ (®(E, pn) — ®(t, bn))dt} < — lonlle max{|V@®(é,z)|: ¢ € [0,7], |z| > |bn| — T}.

Therefore, condition (15) allows us to take n sufficiently large so that

fa
[ (®(t, pn) — ®(t, bn))dt

Substituting this into (40) yields
‘ Qn + MT ia
Tym) < eli (1-2-7) — f acestn)ar,

for all n € N sufficiently large. In addition, since ie ®(t,b,)dt = y(bn), condition (14) implies that

, 30+ MT
Z(Pa) < -ellénI2 ( tit) .

for all n € N sufficiently large. Therefore, taking e < (3 + MTr-)™, we obtain that Z(p,) < 0, for all
n €N sufficiently large.

14
We conclude this section by proving the existence of negative values of the action functional within the
framework of Theorem 2.3. The proof in this case differs significantly from that of Proposition 5.1, as it
relies on a negative gradient flow. We stress that Lemma 4.1 could also have been established using this
alternative approach. The precise statement is as follows.

Proposition 5.2. Let (A,®) € AP satisfy condition (17). Then there exists q € Ka such that Z(q) < 0.
Proof. Fix (A,®) € AP as in the statement, and take b € S° according to hypothesis (17), that is,
y(b) =0, and d,A(-,b) + V®(-,b) £0.
Note that, trivially, Z(b) = —y(b) = 0. Moreover, since Z(q) is differentiable for all q € R°, it is straight-
forward to verify that
i
Z'(g)[v] = F(a] = - | w (G®A(t,q) + V&(t,q)) dt, for allge R®,wew.
0
Hence, Z'(b) 4 0.
Let us consider the open subset of W defined by
Q= {qEA: |ldlloo <1, Z'(q) 4 0},

so that 6 € Q. It is well-known (see, e.g., [21, Lemma 2.2]) that there exists a locally Lipschitz pseudogra-
dient field V :Q — W for Z in 2. That is, for any q € , one has

IVa) < 2IZ’@)llw-,
L'QV(q)) = IZ @llyv-,

where W* denotes the dual space of W. Consequently, the initial value problem

dx
f(r) =—V(0lr)), 2(0) =,

has a unique solution x € C1((0,6);Q), for some 5 < 1; see, for instance, [9] for details. Furthermore, the
chain rule and the properties of the pseudogradient field yield

Foley) = Tate) [Fe] = LIV) <1") yes forall r€ (0,8).

Hence the function tT ++ Z(a(r)) is decreasing in (0,59) for some do € [0,6), and we conclude that

L(x(r)) < L(x(0)) =Z(b) =0, for all r € (0,60),

which completes the proof.

6 Conclusive remarks

We may rephrase Theorem 3.1 by stating that, for any admissible pair (A,®) € AP for which Z attains
negative values, there exists a non-constant periodic solution to the Lorentz (1). Taking this as the reference
minimization result, Theorem 2.1, Theorem 2.2 and Theorem 2.3 provide sufficient conditions ensuring that
T does attain negative values. We conclude this work by analyzing closely the extent of necessity of the
conditions just mentioned.

To begin with, we recall that the decay conditions (6) and (7) are physically motivated and, more
specifically, they lead to the uniqueness of solution to the Maxwell equations. However, from a purely
mathematical point of view, these decay assumptions are not strictly necessary to have action minimizers,
as shown in [2].
On the other hand, recall that an admissible pair of potentials generates a non-zero electric field, which
provides the convenient framework for studying relativistic dynamics. Even though the absence of electric
field is not an obstruction itself for the existence of action minimizers, it is not difficult to find examples
in the magnetostatic regime such that Z is non-negative everywhere, thus preventing the application of
Theorem 3.1. More concretely, let @ = 0, and let A € C!(R*; R¥) satisfy (31) and ||VAlloo < . Notice
that (A,®) ¢ AP due to the fact that 0,A + V® = 0. Then, Poincaré-Wirtinger inequality (20) implies
that

T

1 T , T T , 2 rT 6 2
BS i|2dt — i|2dt q\2dt ) >0, for all ;
> ff ld ya [ ldl [ lal >0, for all €K,

and, since Z(b) = 0 for all b € R®, it follows that min T(q) = Z(b) = 0. Consequently, Theorem 3.1 fails to
qe
be applicable in this situation, as every constant function is a global minimizer of the functional.

Next, we point out that the nature of the singularities allowed for the potentials in AP must be carefully
constrained in order to expect the existence of a global minimizer of the action functional. Indeed, if y, as
defined in (10), were unbounded from above, then Z would be unbounded from below, so that no global
minimum could exist.

Even more interesting is the possibility of having singularities in the vector potential. For instance,
assume for simplicity that @ = 0, and let A € C1(R x (R® \ {0});R) be T-periodic. Assume in addition
that there exists 6 > 0 such that

O,A(-,b) #0, for all b € R® with |b] € (0,4)

and, furthermore,

Ilglls . ;
- =o, where g(t) = A(t,bd). 42
bE Tellec (t) = AC (42)

It is clear that, in such a case,

llallo
IIGllco

Therefore, condition (42) may be interpreted as a strong divergence of the oscillations of A(t,b) as Db
approaches the singularity. Arguing as in the proof of Lemma 4.1, we derive that the point p = b — eg
defined in (38) satisfies the inequality

. a+MT
Tip) < -elal (1-7 =™*),

for every ¢ > 0 small enough so that ¢||g||.. < 1. Therefore, taking ¢ = 1/||9||20, we deduce

_ tal (.- n+MT
llloo \* ~ Too

Lp) < ) —oo, asb—>0.
We have thus obtained a curve b ++ p along which Z is always negative and diverges to —oo, demonstrating
that global minimizers cannot exist in this setting. Therefore, in the absence of a scalar potential, singular

vector potentials may lead to a breakdown of the minimization framework.

A Appendix

Here we prove that the velocity of any periodic solution to the Lorentz force equation is uniformly bounded
in the case of a continuous electromagnetic field. In our framework, this corresponds with the choice of
S = (. Consequently, for any (A,®@) € AP in this situation, the critical points of the functional TZ are
contained in a subset of K that is compactly embedded on it. Hence all such trajectories remain at a
positive distance from the boundary 0K, which represents the set of motions approaching the speed of
light in vacuum. The result is the following.

Lemma A.1. For any (A,®) € AP there exists p € (0,1) such that

for every periodic solution q(t) of the Lorentz force equation (1).

Proof. First, since S = 0, for any (A,®) € AP, it is satisfied that
C := max { |All cesy: tis |det(V A(t, x))], [VSll.~es)} < 0,

which follows from the decay conditions (6) and (7), and the regularity of the potentials.

On the other hand, by introducing the relativistic momentum p = Jae the Lorentz force equation
-|4

(1) admits the following Hamiltonian formulation:
Pp

f= —__,
V1 + |p?

Then, given a periodic solution (q,p) : [0,1] + R®° of (43), necessarily there exists a time to € [0,7] such
that g(to) = p(to) = 0. As a result, by integrating the second equation in (43), we directly obtain that

p=—-V9(t,q) —%A(t.q) + @x V x A(t). (43)

|p(t)| = / [V®(s, q(s)) + ®A(s, g(s)) — G(s) x V x A(s,q(s))] ds} <TC, for all t € [0,7],

and using this bound in the first equation of (43), we conclude that

TC

lq(t)| < Vie Po =:p<1, for allt € [0,7],

which completes the proof.
