Abstract

Under certain assumptions, we show that unitary rational NV = (2,2) conformal field theories to-
gether with a certain generating set of Cardy boundary states in the associated boundary conformal
field theories give rise to rational Hodge structures of complex multiplication type. We argue that
these rational Hodge structures for such rational conformal field theories arising from infrared fixed
points of NV = (2,2) non-linear sigma models with Calabi-Yau target spaces coincide with the ra-
tional Hodge structures of the middle-dimensional cohomology of the target space geometry. This
gives non-trivial evidence of the general expectation in the literature that rational NV’ = (2,2) super-
symmetric conformal field theories associated to Calabi-Yau target spaces yield middle dimensional
cohomological rational Hodge structures with complex multiplication. We exemplify our general
results with the N = 2 A-type minimal model series which do not have a geometric origin as
a non-linear sigma model and with two explicit MN = (2,2) Gepner models that correspond to
particular non-linear sigma models with specific Calabi-Yau threefold target spaces.

1. Introduction

The classification of two-dimensional unitary conformal field theories is a daunting problem. Such
conformal field theories possess a left- and right-moving Virasoro algebra Vir x Vir as its symmetry
algebra, and they can be organised according to their central charge c — the unique central element
of the Virasoro algebra Vir. Unitary two-dimensional conformal field theories with central charges
in the range 0 < c < 1 are classified in terms of the discrete and countable series of Virasoro
minimal models [1]. These theories are referred to as minimal because their Hilbert spaces are
constructed from a finite number of Virasoro highest weight representations.

Already for the central charge c = 1 there are uncountably many unitary two-dimensional conformal
field theories. The free boson with a circular target space S! with radius R yields a conformal field
theory with central charge c = 1, where distinct radii R (suitable normalised) in the real interval
[1, 00) realise inequivalent — and hence uncountably many — conformal field theories with central
charge c = 1. As the conformal field theory of a boson on a circle S! has a free Lagrangian
description, it can be solved exactly. Nevertheless opposed to Virasoro minimal models
the Hilbert space of states arises from an infinite (countable) number of Virasoro heighest weight
representations. However, it is well known that if the square of the radius R? is a rational number
the Virasoro algebra Vir is enhanced to a larger chiral algebra A, see for instance refs. [2-4]. Then
in terms of this extended symmetry algebra A the Hilbert space of states is again constructed from
a finite number of highest weight representations [5].

In general, two-dimensional conformal field theories with finitely many highest weight representa-
tions with respect to its chiral symmetry algebra A are called rational [5]. For families of conformal
field theories described by a moduli space M also often referred to as the conformal manifold
M a challenging question to ask is whether a particular conformal field theory in the family is
rational or not and what is the distribution of rational conformal field theories in M. Finding two-
dimensional rational conformal field theories is an important task as such conformal field theories
can be solved with algebraic methods [6, 7 even and in particular in the absence of a Lagrangian
description.

Two-dimensional non-linear sigma models with compact Riemannian target space manifolds X
flow at their infrared fixed point either to the vacuum or to a non-trivial unitary two-dimensiona:
conformal field theory [8-10]. In the latter case, the resulting conformal field theory may be a
member of a whole family of conformal field theories, in which the moduli of the Riemannian
manifold X parametrise (a subspace of) the conformal manifold M of this family. Starting from
its geometric origin, it is in general a difficult problem to determine the infrared unitary conforma:
field theories and their properties. To further characterise the infrared conformal field theories an
important question is now to determine those infrared fixed points which correspond to conforma:
field theories that are rational and to describe the distribution of such rational conformal field
theories in the conformal manifold M. In particular, a dense distribution of rational conforma:
field theories in M implies that the correlators of any member of the conformal family can (at leas
in principle) be approximated arbitrarily precisely by an exactly solvable rational conformal field
theory in its vicinity.!

The infrared fixed points of families of non-linear sigma models with a toroidal target space X
with a flat metric (and orbifolds thereof) admit a Lagrangian description in terms of free bosons.
Therefore, these conformal field theories can be solved by means of canonical quantization. For
these classes of theories — which serve as an important theoretical laboratory to examine conformal

2. A Review of Two-Dimensional Unitary Rational Conformal Field Theories

In this section, we review some aspects of rational conformal field theories in order to set the
stage for the analysis performed in the subsequent sections. We first introduce the notion of two-
dimensional unitary rational conformal field theories and review their modular properties captured
by what is known as the Verlinde formula. The Verlinde formula further implies a Galois action
on the modular S-matrices of rational conformal field theories. Then we specialise to unitary
N = (2,2) superconformal field theories, as this class of theories are relevant for this work. Finally,
we introduce boundary states in the context of the associated boundary conformal field theories
following the Cardy construction.

2.1. Unitary rational conformal field theories

A two-dimensional conformal field theory consists of quantum fields ¢4(z,Z),a € I abelled by
an index set I that in general depend on the left-moving holomorphic coordinate z and the
right-moving anti-holomorphic coordinate Z of the (Euclidean) two-dimensional space-time. The
conformal field theory is equipped with the operator product algebra by virtue of the operator
product expansions among the quantum fields ¢q(z,Z), see, e.g. the textbooks [3, 4, 50].

The subset J C I of holomorphic quantum fields O,(z), a € J, forms a closed subalgebra Amax
of the operator product algebra because the operator product of two holomorphic fields expands
again into holomorphic fields only. The subalgebra Amax is called the chiral algebra of the conformal
field theory. Analogously, there is the anti-chiral subalgebra Amax of the operator product algebra,
which concerns the operator product expansion of anti-holomorphic quantum fields. In this work,
we concentrate on left-right-symmetric conformal field theories for which the chiral and anti-chiral
algebras Amax and Amax are isomorphic. Note that any conformal field theory contains with the
identity field and the holomorphic energy momentum tensor T'(z) at least two holomorphic fields,
which give rise to the Virasoro algebra Vir contained in the chiral algebra Ajax. That is to say,
Vir is the smallest possible chiral algebra of any two-dimensional conformal field theory.

The Hilbert space H. of physical states® of a unitary conformal field theory decomposes into ir-
reducible representations of the algebra Amax X Amax- A unitary conformal field theory is called
rational [2, 51, 52], if the states in its Hilbert space H decompose into finite sets HWRy(Amax)
and HWRy(Amax) of irreducible representations with respect to the algebras Amax and Amax-

More generally, we may consider a subalgebra A of Amax, containing the Virasoro algebra Vir, i.e.
Vir C AC Amax ; (2.1)

such that the states of the rational unitary conformal field theory still assemble themselves into
finitely many representations of HWRz(A) and HWRz(A).4 In terms of such a subalgebra the
Hilbert space H of the rational unitary conformal field theory becomes

a= B miz Hj ® Hz , (2.2)

where mj;z are non-negative integral multiplicities and H; (and Hz) furnish the spaces of physical
states associated to the representations i (and 7). These spaces are constructed from highest weight

'We will use the words “state” and “vector” often interchangeably as a state refers to a vector in a physical
Hilbert space.

‘Neither of the inclusions of algebras in eq. (2.1) are required to be proper. For instance, the unitary minimal

consistent with our requirements.
representations upon acting with the negative modes of the quantum fields of the algebra A (and
the algebra A). For ease of notation, we use i (and 7) both for the irreducible highest weight
representation and for the associated space of states H; (and H;). For the rational conformal field

theories studied in this work the collection of irreducible representations HWR7(A) and HWRy(A)
are assumed to be isomorphic with respect to the isomorphic algebras A and A.

Note that the highest weight representations HWR (A) that appear in the construction of the
Hilbert space H of a given unitary rational conformal field theory may furnish a proper subset of
the set of all highest weight representation HWR(A) of the algebra A, ice.

HWRx(A) C HWR(A). (2.3)

The set of representations HWR (A) depends on the detailed definition of the unitary rational con-
formal field theory under consideration, whereas the set of representations HWR(A) is determined
by the symmetry algebra A alone.

The quantum fields associated to highest weight representations of the algebras A and A are called
A-primary fields Ya(z,Z) or short primary fields, where the index a ranges over the highest weight
representations, which is a finite set for rational conformal field theories. The primary fields have
the two-point correlation functions

where hy/p,q are the left and right conformal weights of the primary field a(z,Z) and the sym-
metric constants Ca, are only non-vanishing for hppa = hye». For unitary rational conformal
field theories, the two-point correlation constants cay furnish a non-degenerate finite-dimensional
quadratic pairing, which allows us to assign to each primary field ya(z,Z) a dual primary field
%(z,2) = 4, c*yo(z,Z) in terms of the inverse matrix c” of cay. As a result, every unitary ra-
tional conformal field theory is equipped on the set of primary fields yq(z,Z) with an involutive
duality homomorphism C

This duality involution C acting on primary fields is known as the charge conjugation operator, as it

reverses the charges of the primary fields with respect to any spin-1 currents in the conformal field

theory. Note that the unique identity primary field yp := I of the unitary conformal field theory

labelled by the representation index 0 is self-dual with respect to the charge conjugation
operators C, that is C(yo) = Yo.

C=1. (2.5)

2.2. Modularity of unitary rational conformal field theories

As a two-dimensional conformal field theory ought to be well-defined on any (Euclidean) two-
dimensional space-time geometry, it must be consistent in particular on any two-dimensional
torus T? with a choice of complex structure realizing local holomorphic and anti-holomorphic
coordinates z of the quantum fields ¢4(z,Z). For a given algebra A with finite set HWR(A) of irre-
ducible highest-weight representation, let us assume that there is a rational conformal field theory
with HWRyz(A) = HWR(A). Then HWR(A) furnishes a finite-dimensional unitary representation
p: SL(2,Z) — U(M), with M := |HWR(A)|. In particular, the unique irreducible representation
associated to the identity primary yo is labelled by the representation index 0.

The modular group SL(2, Z) is generated by the 2 x 2-matrices
which obey the relations S+ = Igy and (ST) = S?. The unitary representation p is specified
by the images p(S) =: S and p(Z’) =: T in U(M), which are referred to as the modular T- and
S-matrices of the rational conformal field theory. Using the formulation of ref. [53], the S-matrices
in the image of the representation p is symmetric and squares to the charge conjugation operator
C,> ie.

s=5, Sed, (2.7)

which also implies that S*S = Ix and S = CS*. From the latter condition we readily infer with
the self-duality of the identity representation 0 that the entries So; of the symmetric matrix S for
any representation 1 € HWR(A) are real and non-vanishing. For later convenience, we define the
charge conjugation operator

C:HWR(A) > HWR(A), = i C(i) , (2.8)

which is induced from the unitary charge conjugation operator C.

The existence of the representation p of the modular group SL(2,Z) of the conformal field theory
means that, on the level of the characters y;(7) of the representations 1 € HWR(A), the modular
T- and S-transformations of the characters are

jEHWR(A) j€HWR(A)

Here Tj; and S;; are the entries of the finite-dimensional unitary modular matrices T and S, and r
is the complex structure parameter in the upper half plane.®

The operator-state-correspondence assigns to states in the representations i € HWR(A) quantum
fields, which, in virtue of the operator product expansion, give a ring structure to the set of
representations HWR(A) known as the fusion ring [6]. For rational conformal field theories — i.e.
for a finite set HWR(A) of representations i the fusion product is conveniently expressed in
terms of the fusion ring structure constants NV’ es namely

gxk= Nin, (2.10)
iG HWR(A)

with the integral structure constants NV 4 € Z. The fusion product now states that the operator
product expansion of the quantum fields ¢; and ¢, associated to the representations 7 and k
expands into a linear combination of quantum fields of the representations i € HWR(A) with
multiplicities Ni,”

The modular consistency of a conformal field theory imposes strong constraints on the fusion ring.
For rational conformal field theories these modular consistency conditions give rise to a remarkable
and far-reaching connection between the structure constants Ni, of the fusion ring and the unitary

®'The action of the square S? = —Iox2 of the modular 2 x 2 matrix S' on the one-cycles of the torus T? reverses
the orientation of all homology one-cycles. As a consequence the unitary transformation S? = p(—I2y2) multiplies all
spin-1 currents with (—1), which implies the relation to the charge conjugation operator yoo

°For extended chiral algebras .A, the characters y; typically depend on further parameters. For simplicity and
ease of notation, we do not spell out these dependences here.

7The fusion product is independent of the chosen quantum fields assigned to the representations i and j. Note
further that the fusion product originates from the interaction of quantum fields and is thus a property of the quantum
field theory. It should not be confused with the tensor product of highest weight representations. For a mathematical
exposition to fusion rings, see for instance refs. [54-56].

where 0,i1,...,i:—1 label the M representations of HWR(A).

A representation J € HWR(A) is called a simple current if the fusion product of J with any other
representation i € HWR(A) yields a single representation 7(i) € HWR(A), ie. J x i =: J(i)
[53] Tt follows that the set of all simple currents form an Abelian group with respect to the fusion
product x, where the neutral element is the identity representation 0 € HWR(A) associated to the
identity primary field yo. Furthermore, the monodromy charge of a simple current 7 is defined as
the map

where hz, hj and hz(;) are the conformal weights of the representations 7, i, and J (i), respectively.
Note that the monodromy charge ® 7 of a simple current J of order N, ie. J N —T, applied to
any representation i € HWR(A) takes values in Q/Z, namely?

®,(i) € Q/Z with No;(i) = (ole Q/Z. (2.14)

The transformation behaviour of the modular S-matrix with respect to the action of a simple
current J is given by [58, 59]

2.3. The Galois group of a rational conformal field theory

Following the arguments of refs. [60, 61], the Verlinde formula (2.12) implies that we can associate
a Galois group to any rational conformal field theory. It is this Galois group that plays a central
role in the forth-coming considerations of this work.

The characteristic polynomials of the M x M fusion matrices N, define a set of M degree-M
polynomials Py € Z[X] C Q[X] with rational (in fact integral) coefficients as

P,(X) = det(Na = X Ix) : (2.16)

As the Verlinde formula (2.12) shows that the matrices Ng are similar to the diagonal matrices Aq,
the roots of the characteristic polynomials P,(X) — that is to say the eigenvalues of N, — are the
algebraic numbers A,,;, which give rise to the finite field extension

QA) = Q(LAaitaicHwrA)) - (2.17)

5The discussion on simple currents in this subsection applies equally well for the subset of representa-
tions HWRx (A).
°For rational conformal field theories, any simple current 7 is of finite order, due to the finiteness of the set

By construction, Q(A) is the splitting field of the product polynomial |] acHwr(A) Pa(X) € Q{X],
which is hence a normal extension of Q. As any finite field extension of Q is separable, Q(A) is a
Galois extension of Q.

Let o € Gal(Q(A)/Q) be an element of the Galois group of the field extension Q(A). Due to
the relation P,(o(Aai)) = 7(Pa(Aai)) = 9, the root Ag; is mapped to another root o(Ag,) of the
polynomial P,, we get
o(raji) = Aa,ca(i) , (2.18)

where for a given a € HWR(A) the permutation ¢, of the symmetric group Sym(HWR(.A)) permutes
the representations HWR(.A) that label the highest weight representations of the chiral algebra A.
The non-trivial claim is now that the permutation ¢, € Sym(HWR(A)) is in fact independent of
the representation a € HWR(A) [60],!° such that the elements ¢ of the Galois group Gal(Q(A)/Q)
act on the roots as

O(Aai) = Aa,c(i) for all a € HWR(A) , (2.19)
in terms of a permutation ¢ of the symmetric group Sym(HWR(4A)) associated to the Galois group

element o.

The complex conjugate roots Af, are in the normal field extension Q(X) because Py(Aa,i) = 0.

Using SS* = Inrxar, 87 =S and So; € R \ {0}, we observe

1 Sa,i Sai * _ “\*
z= x (=) = SS Andie. (2.20)

a€HWR(A) a€HWR(A)

That is to say, the squares Sez are in the field extension Q(A) as well. The definition (2.12) of Agi
further implies for all squares of the entries of the matrix S that

S2,€Q(A), forall a,ic¢ HWR(A). (2.21)

In order to determine the Galois action on the squares Ss we first note that complex conjuga-
tion -* : Q(A) > Q(A) is a Q-automorphism that realises a group element v of the Galois group
Gal(Q(A)/Q),!! which according to eq. (2.19) is given by Nai = 'Aai) = Aau(iy- From eq. (2.20)
we therefore deduce for any 7 € Gal(Q(A)/Q) the action on Sq. 2 as

1 . Sa,s(i) Sa,rocou(d) 53) nosauti)
“(z) = > Aas(i)Aaocou(t) = » S._.SF 5_.S —, (2.22)
0,4 acHWR(A) acHWR(A) 0,5(4)°0,cosou(z) 0,<(#)°0,cosou(é)

where we use So,; € R\ {0}. As the inverse squares So, 2 are non-vanishing, their images with respect
to the Q-automorphism ¢ are non-zero for any index i as well, that is, 6,() ,0co.(#) = 1 for all i €
HWR(A). This means that the elements ¢ and 10 ¢ 014 of the symmetric group Sym(HWR(A)) are
identical so that ($3) = So. i), Which together with the definition of Aq; and the equation (2.19)
yields for any o € Gal(Q(A)/Q) the Galois action [60]

o(Sai) = Sac) forall a@€HWR(A). (2.23)

The presented arguments show that complex conjugation via the Galois group element . generates a
normal subgroup (which is trivial if the field Q(A) is totally real) of the Galois group Gal(Q(A)/Q).

©The independence of a can be argued for by observing that the Verlinde formula (2.11) implies for the roots
Aai the relation AqiAvi = DeeHwR(A) N&,Ac,i- The action of the Galois group element o yields the relation
Nasa (i) Ab.sp (1) = Doe NipAcyce(i)s Which is only consistent if the permutation ¢a is independent of the index a [60].

"Tf the field Q(A) is totally real, then v is the identity element of Gal(Q(A)/Q). Otherwise the involution «
generates a subgroup Z/2Z C Gal(Q(A)/Q).

10
Such fields are called Kroneckerian. This means that the field Q(A) is either totally real or that
there exists an intermediate totally real and normal field extension L/Q such that Q(A)/L is a
totally imaginary quadratic field extension — in other words, Q(A) is a CM-field over L.?

The Galois group Gal(Q(A)/Q) is actually Abelian, which can be argued for as follows [60]. Firstly,
as the matrix S is symmetric the definition (2.12) of Aq; implies

Xa,0

ra, = Xi,a deg

for all a,i € HWR(A) . (2.24)

Secondly, taking the square root the action (2.23) of the Galois group Gal(Q(A)/Q) yields

Ag(a) iio = £Ac(i),aAa,0 for all a € Gal(Q(A)/Q) . (2.25)

Then, for any two elements 01,02 € Gal(Q(A)/Q) one finds [60]

Na ») ( Na ,52(0) ) (Ga Xa,0 )
o102(Aai) = o102 | Xia ) = 01 ( Aj o ~—

i

(a),0

which proves that the Galois group Gal(Q(A)/Q) is indeed Abelian. This derivation uses extensively
the identity (2.24), and in the second line the identity (2.25) is used for the representation i = 0
together with the property ¢(+1) = +1 for any Q-automorphism o € Gal(Q(A)/Q).

rary

Let us finally introduce the field extension Q(S) generated by the entries of the modular S-matrix
elements Sg; given by [61]

Q(S) := Q({Saitaienwris)) D Q(A) D Q. (2.27)
This is a Galois extension of the field Q(A), since Q(S) is the splitting field of the polynomials
Pai = 2 — (Sai)? € QOA)[z] , (2.28)

which are separable for non-vanishing entries Sa,;. Furthermore, the field extension Q(S) is Galois
over Q as well, because any Q-automorphism o of any field containing Q(S) is closed on the
subfield Q(A),!° ie., o(Q(A)) C Q(A), which implies for $f; € Q(A), for any i € HWR(A), that
o(So,i) = €o(%)So,<(i), Where €,(i) € {—-1, +1}. Due to the relation Sq; = SoiAa,i, we further find

a(Sai) = €o(%4) Sa.c(s) with ég(i) € {-1,4+1} for all i€ HWR(A). (2.29)

Here, the permutation ¢ € Sym(HWR(4A)) of eq. (2.19) is obtained from the restriction of the
Qautomorphism o to the subfield Q(\). Note that in this equation the sign €,(i) is independent
of the representation a € HWR(A).

Finally, we conclude that o(Q(S)) C Q(S) for any Q-automorphism o as defined above, and there-
fore the extension Q(S) of Q is normal and separable and hence Galois [61]. Furthermore, due
to the symmetry Saji = Sia it is straightforward to verify with eq. (2.29) that the Galois group
Gal(Q(S)/Q) is also Abelian [61].

"Tn latter case, by the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, L arises as the invariant field with respect to the
normal subgroup Z/2Z of the Galois group Gal(Q(A)/Q).
This follows from the fact that the roots of Aa,i arise from polynomials over Q.

2.4. NM = (2,2) supersymmetric rational conformal field theories

In this section, we briefly review some salient points of A’ = (2,2) rational superconformal field
theories, mostly to set the notation for the discussion in later sections. This standard material is
covered in many review articles and textbooks on two-dimensional superconformal field theories,
see, for instance, refs. [20, 48-50, 62].

In addition to the Virasoro generators Lm, m € Z, of the Virasoro algebra Vir, which are the Laurent
modes of the spin-two energy momentum tensor T(z) = >, Lmz-™~?, the N = 2 superconformal
algebra extends the Virasoro algebra Vir by the modes J, m € Z, which form the Laurent modes of
a spin-one U(1) current J(z) =o, Jmz~™ +, and by the Grassmannian — that is to say fermionic

modes G*, which form the Laurent modes of a pair of spin-3 currents G+(z) = >, G# 2rd,
The spin-3 currents G+(z) have charge +1 with respect to the U(1) current J(z). Note that the
energy momentum tensor current T(z), the spin-3 current G+(z) and the R-symmetry current J(z)
combine into a two-dimensional NV = 2 super energy momentum tensor.

Depending on a choice of spin structure on the punctured plane C*, the currents G*(z) have anti-
periodic boundary conditions — called the Ramond (R) sector — or periodic boundary conditions
called the Neveu-Schwarz (NS) sector, which respectively yields integral modes G*,r € Z or
half-integral modes G#,r € Z+ a Lies
Ramond (R) sector: G#(e""z) =-G*(z) = {GF}
Neveu-Schwarz (NS) sector: G*(e?"z)=+G*(z2) = {G+}

All these modes generate the NV’ = 2 superconformal algebra also known as the NV’ = 2 super-
Virasoro algebra SVir — which is given in terms of the commutation and anti-commutation relations

An N = (2,2) supersymmetric rational conformal field theory possesses a left- and right-moving
N = 2 super-Virasoro algebra SVir xSVir as its symmetry algebra. Note, however, that the entire
super-Virasoro algebra SVir is not part of the chiral algebra A, as the supersymmetry currents
G*(z) give rise to half-integral weight operators, which make SVir into a super-Lie algebra as
opposed to an ordinary Lie algebra. Thus, the NV = 2 super-Virasoro algebra SVir is not a chiral
algebra [52], but instead the chiral subalgebra A of an NV = (2, 2) supersymmetric rational conformal
field theory is generated from Grassmann even operators.

The respective VV = 2 superconformal algebras of the Ramond sector and the Neveu-Schwarz sector
SVirr and SVirns are actually isomorphic [63]. Let y and y’ be elements of these algebras, then
the isomorphism is explicitly realised as [20, 49, 62, 63]

2 24
SVirg —> SVirys , YO yy’ =U XU with I = dat Gamo . (2.32)

G ro Gat

In particular, this algebra isomorphism induces an isomorphism U/ on the level of representations,
which is called the spectral flow operator U/. In the above definition it acts by conjugation on the

12
elements of the super- Virasoro algebra by conjugations, while it maps states from representations of
the Ramond sector to states of the corresponding representation in the Neveu-Schwarz sector, i.e.,

U:HWRxz(A)ns —> HWRx(A)p - (2.33)

Let us also recall the definition of the chiral ring of a NV = 2 super conformal algebra [46]. A super-
conformal primary field ¢(z,Z) is called a chiral primary field or an anti-chiral primary field, if the
operator product expansion with the spin-3 current Gt(z) or the spin-3 current G7 (z) is regular,
respectively. Equivalently, due to the operator-state-correspondence between the field ¢(z,Z) and
the state |), a super-conformal primary state |¢) is called a chiral primary state or an anti-chiral
primary state, if Gt, /2 |¢) =O or G7, /2 |¢) = 0, respectively. Analogous characterizations apply

to the anti-holomorphic sector with respect to the anti-holomorphic currents G (Z), such that
super-conformal primary fields with regular operator product expansions with respect to both the
holomorphic and the anti-holomorphic sectors are characterised as

(c,c) state: Grin 1d) = Grip ¢)=0, (a,a) state: Gai jp 1d) = Gi |) =0, (2.34)
(c,a) state: Grin |¢) =G_1/2|¢) =0, (a,c) state: GT, )5|0) = Gp |o) =0.

Here the entries of the labels (c/a,c/a) refer to chiral (c) and anti-chiral (a) constraints in the
holomorphic and anti-holomorphic sector. A far-reaching implication now is that the operator

product expansion among (c/a,c/a) primary fields are regular and preserve the chirality property.
As result the limit of two such primary fields approaching each other is well-defined and defines
a ring structure among these primary fields [46]. Therefore, the WV = (2,2) superconformal field
theories are equipped with four rings, namely the (c,c)-ring, the (a,a)-ring, the (c,a)-ring, and the
(a,c)-ring of primary fields.

Let us also record that for a chiral (anti-chiral) primary state |d) the left- and right-moving con-
formal weights and U(1) charges, which are given by

Lo|¢) = hi (1$)) 16), Lol) =hr(l@)) 14)» Jole) = an(¢)) 14) » Joe) = ar(14)) 19)» (2.35)

obey — as a consequence of the anti-commutators {Gt, /2 Gr, jot = 2Lo $+ Jo

hryr(lo)) = +4 aryR(\0)) » (2.36)
where the positive (negative) sign applies for chiral (anti-chiral) states, respectively. Furthermore,

for unitary NV = (2,2) supersymmetric conformal field theories the anti-commutators {Ge /2? Gyo =

2Lo+Jo+ 2c together with the positive definite inner product on the space of physical states implies

Oshiro) <6 = OS laze) <5; (2:37)

where the charges gz/p(|¢)) are positive (negative) in the chiral (anti-chiral) states.

Finally, acting with the spectral flow operator U on a chiral primary |¢), we observe that the
chirality condition implies that the corresponding state U/|¢) in the Ramond sector is annihilated
by Gp according to eq. (2.32). Hence a chiral primary state is mapped to a Ramond ground state
via the spectral flow operator. Note also that a generic state |a) in the Neveu-Schwarz sector with
U(1) charge qz/p(|@)) flows to a state U |a) in the Ramond sector with charge

|o)) = qrjr(la)) -§ 5 (2.38)
where the subscript is chosen according to whether the spectral flow is taken in the left- or right-

moving algebra. For later reference, the charge conjugation operator C, which is induced by the
charge conjugation operator (2.5) of the fields, acts on the Jo, Jo eigenstates as

2.5. Boundary conformal field theory

Consider on the unit conformal disk of a left-right symmetric unitary rational conformal field theory
with symmetry algebra A x A as introduced in section 2.1, together with an algebra automorphism
Q:A— A of the algebra A that restricts to the identity on the Virasoro subalgebra of A. In order
to preserve the subalgebra A @ A x A, W > (W,Q(W)) at the boundary of the conformal unit
disk, the boundary state |B) which in radial quantization is a closed string state at the unit
circle — must obey the conditions [64-66]

(Win —(-1)) (Wm) |B) =0 forall meZ. (2.40)

Here W,,, are the Laurent modes of the symmetry generator W(z) = ein Winz7™") of conformal
weight h(W) of the symmetry algebra A. In particular, for the Virasoro generators L,, there is the
constraint (Lm — Lm) |B) =0 for all integers m.

Given an irreducible representation i € HWRy(A) of the algebra A with Hilbert space Hj, a
solution to the constraints (2.40) is realised by the Ishibashi boundary state [64]

+oo di(N)

li) = SO YO lsN,k) @UTEN,® , (2.41)

N=0 k=1

where |i; NV,k) and |i; N,k) are, respectively, d;(V)-dimensional orthonormal bases for the states
of the isomorphic Hilbert spaces H; and H; at level N. In particular, at level zero, |i;0,1) := |i)
is the highest weight state of the representation i € HWRy,(A). Moreover, U : Hi > H; is the
anti-unitary operator that acts by complex conjugation on the state |i) and conjugates the modes
of the chiral symmetry operators of A according to

UW,U = (1) AW) forall =meZ. (2.42)

The vanishing inner products (i; N, £|@ (U(t N,®| (Wm — (-1)"™) Q(W_:m)) |i) for all labels ¢ =
,.-.,d;(.N) at any given level N imply that the Ishibashi boundary state (2.41) is indeed a solution
o the constraint (2.40) [66].

While the Ishibashi boundary states |2)) for all i € HWRy,(A) fulfill the constraints (2.40), a bound-
ary state |B) must be compatible with modular S-transformations that transforms a propagating
closed string boundary states |B) into the partition function of the open string with the imposed
oundary conditions [66]. Specifically, one equates the matrix element M4g(q) for the overlap
etween the boundary state |B,4) and the boundary states that arises from propagating |Bg) for
an imaginary time ¢ with the open-string partition function Z4'5"(q) of the open-string states with
xoundary conditions labelled by A and B, i.e.

Map(q) = 245" - (2.43)

Here the matrix element M,p(q) and the S-transformed open-string partition function Z455"(@)
are respectively given by [66]

Map(q) = (Balq’*-%3 (Bp) with «= g := (2.44)
and 3
ZG = Tray, with G:ee rt, (2.45)

with H4, being the Hilbert space of open-string states with boundary conditions A and B.

In order to fulfil the boundary conditions (2.40), the boundary states |B,4) are realised as linear
combinations of Ishibashi boundary states |i)), i.e

|Ba) = > baali)) (2.46)

which yield the matrix elements

open-string partition function (2.45) expands also into representations of the algebra A, namely

Zip] = > wtrexi(i) » (2.48)

in terms of integral multiplicities ni, g- Imposing eq. (2.43) leads for any boundary conditions A

For conformal field theories with HWR(A) = HWRz(A) the constraints (2.49) are fulfilled upon

Then the Cardy boundary states |B4) for a boundary label A enjoy the expansion [66]

Sai |.

with an overall normalisation v, which must be chosen such that the condition (2.49) is fulfilled. If,
however, HWRy(A) is a proper subset of HWR(A), the states given by the sum over HWRy(A)
of the form

Sai |.
|Bab =v li) , (2.51)

may not fulfill the Cardy condition (2.49). However, those states

representations 1 € HWR(A) \ HWR (A) — or more generally those rational linear combinations
of states )>4c4|Ba) with 04 case = 0 for all i € HWR(A) \ HWRz(A) — realise boundary
states as they obey the Cardy conditions (2.49). In the following, we refer to legitimate boundary
states of the form (2.51) as generalised Cardy boundary states.

In the presence of fermions, the definition of the matrix element (2.44) and the open string partition
function (2.45) depends on a choice of spin structure on S! [67, 68]. Namely, in the computation
of the open-string partition function (2.45) the trace is obtained from fermions with anti-periodic
boundary conditions, which in the closed string channel yields fermions in the Neveu-Schwarz
sector with anti-periodic boundary conditions. The open-string trace with the insertion of the
operator (—1)* (in terms of the fermion number operator F) imposes periodic fermionic boundary
conditions, which corresponds to periodic closed-string fermions in the Ramond sector. As a result
the open- and closed-string channels get identified as [67—70]

MYQ(q) = Trtan(-l)Fa-% , = MEP (q) = Tran -* , (2.52)

15
where the superscripts (R) and (NS) refer accordingly to the Ramond and Neveu-Schwarz sectors
of the closed string matrix elements.

Let us consider Cardy boundary states for left-right symmetric V = (2,2) supersymmetric rational
conformal field theories, which possess a left- and right-moving MM = 2 super-Virasoro algebra
SVir xSVir. BPS boundary states preserve an N = 2 subalgebra SVir  SVir xSVir, which is
determined by a choice of algebra automorphism 2 : SVir > SVir.

For BPS boundary states — which preserve half of the supersymmetry at the boundary and hence
a subalgebra SVir of SVir xSVir there are A-type boundary conditions, which arise from an
algebra automorphism mapping J to —J and consequentially G+ to e'¢GF for the phase a,
and there are B-type boundary conditions, which arise from an algebra automorphism mapping
J to J and therefore G* to e*#®G* for the phase 6.'4 In addition to the Virasoro constraints
(Im — L-m)|B) = 0, an A-type or B-type boundary state |B) is therefore further constrained.
Namely, it must fulfil — due to the conformal weights h(J) = 1 and h(G*) = 3 together with
eq. (2.40) — the conditions [67, 68, 70

A-type: (Jm—I-—m)|B) = 0, (GE +ieH*GT,)|B) = 0,

_ oo (2.53)
B-type: (Jm+J—-m)|B) = 0, (Gt +ie*#G*,)|B) = 0,

for all integral or half-integral modes m and r.

For such BPS boundary conditions the positive energy eigenstates in the open-string Hilbert
space Hap — as measured by the open-string Hamiltonian Hopen = Lo — 37 — come in mas-
sive supersymmetric multiplets with an equal number of bosonic and fermionic states at the same
positive energy eigenvalue. Hence, in the supersymmetric setting the positive energy eigenstates
in the trace of the open-string partition function Try, p(-bF qo cancel, the partition function
becomes independent of the parameter q, and it turns into the index Try, , (—1)¥ of the open-string

ground states. According to eq. (2.52), the matrix element MY) (q) is independent on q = e~2*" as

well.

The bra states in the matrix element MY (a) associated to the boundary label A must be cho-

sen with care in order to agree with the boundary conditions of the open-string fermionic modes
of the index Try,,(—1)". Let |B4) be an A-type boundary state that fulfils the boundary con-
straint (2.53) with the phase a. Then the Hermitian conjugate of this constraint yields the A-type
constraint (Ba| (G# + ieF(¢-") GF) = 0 with the new phase a — 7, and hence the bra state (B,|
preserves another linear combination of left-right moving supercharges than the ket state |Ba).
However, by acting from the right on this conjugate constraint with the operator e'7/° where Jo
denotes the left-moving zero mode of the R-symmetry current J(z), one obtains the A-type con-
straint (Bal e'™/0(G# + ie¥¢G*,.) = 0 with the original phase « (68, 70].!° A similar argument
applies for the B-type boundary states. Hence, to compare with the open-string index calculation,

the closed-string matrix element MY q@) is given by!®

uM @) _ (Ba| eb 0 ghot Lo~ a3 Bp) . (2.54)

MNote that in general the conformal field theory has boundary states for different values of the phase a.

Assigning the ket boundary state |B) to a D-brane p, the phase shift of a by 7 indicates that the bra boundary
state (Ba| corresponds to boundary state of the anti-D-brane p [71]. The multiplication of the bra boundary state
(Ba| with (—1)" amounts to changing the anti-D-brane p back to the D-brane p.

' As the product of operators (—1)*“e'*”° in terms of the left-moving fermion number operator Fz is central [72],
one can alternatively define an index by p(Ba|(-1)"* |Bs)p [67, 70]. As compared to the insertion of e'"”° the
contributions to the index may differ by a phase. In this work we use the insertion e'"”°.

16
Since this matrix element is independent of the parameter q, it can be computed in the limit
t + +00. In this limit, none of the positive closed string energy modes with respect to the closed
string Hamiltonian Hetosea = Lo + Lo — 5 contributes. As a result, we find, for the open-string
index, the relationship

Traan(-l)* = p(Bale””?|Bp)p - (2.55)

where the states |B4)p are the BPS boundary states |B4) projected to their Ramond-Ramond (RR)

ground states.

Let us further introduce the projected boundary states |B) p that are labelled by the highest-weight
representations A € HWR(A)r, where HWR(A)p is the set of the highest-weight representations
in the Ramond sector of the super-Virasoro algebra SVir, c.f. eq. (2.33). With respect to these
representations, we define the intersection matrix

Y= [Saplapenwr(d)p Yap = p(Bale™” |Bp)p = Tru y,(-L)? (2.56)

Note that this set of representations furnish a set of mutually compatible boundary states, which
implies that all entries of the intersection matrix enjoy the interpretation of an open-string index
such that the intersection matrix is valued in Q (even Z).

The distinction between A-type and B-type boundary states is intimately link to the mirror au-
tomorphism of the VV = 2 super-Virasoro SVir xSVir [73], which acts on the right-moving super-
Virasoro algebra SVir by mapping the right-moving U(1)-current J to —J and the spin-3 currents

G to G. Moreover, the mirror automorphism maps the constraint for A-type boundary states
to the constraint for B-type boundary states according to eq. (2.53) and vice versa [68]. Therefore,
mirror symmetry exchanges A-type boundary states with B-type boundary states. In this work, we
mainly focus on A-type boundary states |B), which implies that such boundary states arise from
a linear combination of states with equal left- and right-moving U(1) charges, among which there
can in particular be (c,c)-primary states with equal left- and right-moving U(1) charges. Applying
the mirror automorphism to such A-type boundary states with a (c,c)-primary states maps them
to B-type boundary states with a (c,a)-primary state.

By the operator-state-correspondence the (c,c)-primary states form the (c,c)-ring. In the following
the (c,c),, 4,-ring refers to the subring of (c,c)-ring elements with equal left- and right-moving
U(1) charges.

For the studied supersymmetric conformal field theory and its associated boundary conformal field
theory with A-type boundary conditions, we often assume that the algebra A with its irreducible
representations HWR (A) can be chosen as subalgebra of Amax with the following properties:!”

(i) The irreducible representations HWR(Amax) of the algebra Amax decomposes into a finite
set HWR7(A) of irreducible representations with respect to the subalgebra A.

ii) Each irreducible representation of HWR(A) contains at most a single chiral super-Virasoro
P- H & P
primary state.

(iii) Each (c,c) primary state belongs to a diagonal representation of HWR(A) x HWRy(A).

(iv) The intersection matrix ¥ defined in eq. (2.56) has maximal rank, which — as a consequence
coincides with the number of (c,c),, 4, primary states.

‘The conditions on the algebra A spelt out with eq. (2.1) automatically guarantee fulfilment of the first property.

3. Hodge Structures of CM Type from Rational Conformal Field Theories

We begin by showing how to construct a rational Hodge structure given a rational conformal
field theory. This construction is motivated by the fact that in the case of a non-linear sigma
models on a complex Kahler manifold X, the construction presented in this section reduces to the
well-known identification between the chiral ring of the conformal field theory and certain sheaf-
valued cohomology theories (see e.g. ref. [20] and references therein). However, in addition to
this classical construction, we emphasise the role of the boundary conformal field theory and the
rational structure given by the boundary states, which makes it possible to discuss rational Hodge
structures, and not only real Hodge structures. We then proceed to define a Hodge structure of
complex multiplication type, and lay out the general idea for obtaining such Hodge structures purely
from conformal field theory considerations. Some explicit settings where these Hodge structures
can be constructed are discussed as examples in following sections.

3.1. Real and rational Hodge structures
A rational Hodge structure of weight m is defined as a tuple (Vg, Vc) of a Q-vector space Vg together
with a decomposition of its complexification:'®
Ve:=Vo®oC = @ ve" (3.1)
prqe=m

such that under complex conjugation the subspaces behave as

VE = ver. (3.2)
The dimensions of the graded pieces are called the Hodge numbers h?? := dime ver. We call
the array (hm, per"... hom] the Hodge type of the Hodge structure. Following the common

convention, sometimes we also refer the list of pairs (p,q) with h?? 4 0 as the Hodge type.

A Hodge substructure is a Q-vector subspace Wg C Vo that is compatible with the Hodge decom-
position of Vg, that is

We :=We®eC = @ Wenvet (3.3)
prq=m
A Hodge structure is called simple if it has no non-trivial Hodge substructures.

A real Hodge structure of weight m and its Hodge substructures are defined in completely analogous
way, by replacing the rational vector space Vg by a real vector space Vg everywhere in the definition.

A rational Hodge structure of weight m is said to be polarised if there exists a polarisation, a
non-degenerate bilinear form Q : Vo x Va — Q, which, extended to Vc by linearity, satisfies the
following conditions:

Q(iv,w) = (-1L)"Q(v, wv) , (3.4)
Qiv,w) = 0, if ve VE, we vee , andp+p' Am, (3.5)
7 Q(v,d) > 0, if ve VE", andu 40. (3.6)

Note that it is clear that a Hodge substructure of a polarised Hodge structure is also polarised,
with the polarisation given by the restriction of Q to the substructure.

'8Such Hodge structures are often called pure to distinguish them from mixed Hodge structures. All Hodge
structures we consider in this paper are pure.

18
3.2. Real Hodge structures from conformal field theories

In this section we show that given any conformal field theory with NV = (2,2) supersymmetry and
finite-dimensional (c,c)-ring, we can associate with it two Hodge structures which we call the A-
and B-type Hodge structures. When the theory admits a geometric interpretation, they correspond
to the horizontal and vertical Hodge structures, respectively. These are constructed using the states
of the chiral-chiral ring (c,c), and the chiral-anti-chiral ring (c,a), respectively.

A-type Hodge structures

The definition of the A-type Hodge structure is based on the (c,c)-ring considered as the com-
plexified vector space Vc. For simplicity, we further restrict to the subring (c,c) — formed by
the states whose left-moving U(1) charge gz is equal to the right-moving charge qr, and make
the assumption that this ring is finite-dimensional.?° Since we have restricted to the case where
the right- and left-moving states appear on equal footing, we mostly only discuss the left-moving
sector. It is left implicit that any action on the left-moving states is accompanied by an action on
the right-moving states such that action is well-defined one the relevant subring.

As reviewed in section 2, the spectral flow operator U acting on a highest-weight state in (c,c) er
gives a RR ground state |a). Define R 5 a as the finite set of representations corresponding to

these states. Then we define the vec

or space Vc as the space spanned by these states:

Ve := (la) )es®. (3.7)

We can always choose the basis sta’

es to be orthogonal, so it makes sense to define normalised

RR ground states |@) y;, a € R, which we take to satisfy

MAB) = Sa - (3.8)

We define the complex conjugation by introducing a complex antilinear endomorphism v : Ve > Vc,
which acts on the elements of Vc as

L (= Ae |) yy

aEeR
Here C is the the charge conjugation operator (2.8) and aq are any complex numbers. The sign is
included so that this definition agrees with the one obtained from geometric considerations when a
geometric interpretation exists (see eq. (3.29)). From the expressions (2.38) and (2.39), it follows
that the U(1)-charges of the state «(|@) ,-) are related to the charge of the original basis state by?

at(u(la))) gr(u(|a))

By tracing how the conformal weights transform under U and C, it is easy to show that U—!1(\a))
is a chiral state, implying that a € R and thus 1(|a)) € Vc. Therefore, it is possible to consistently
define the real vector space Vg as being spanned over R by those elements of Vc that are fixed by
the action of the complex conjugation map 4: Vc > Ve:

= YF sen(Soe(ay)a% |C(a)) y- -
aceR

(3.9)

—ar(le)) ; —ar(la)) - (3.10)

Va := (ve Ve|e(v) =v), - (3.11)

'We could also consider the full (c,c)-ring, which would give rise to a mixed Hodge structure (see e.g. ref. [20]).

?°For superconformal field theories arising from non-linear sigma models, this is always the case when the target
space is a smooth and compact Calabi-~Yau manifold [20].

?1 As the charges qu/er of the RR ground states |a) and the normalised ground states |q),, are equal, for ease of
notation the subscript NV is dropped when referred to the charge of the normalised states |a) ,;.

19
From the definition it immediately follows that the complex vector space Vc is obtained as the
complexification Vg ®p C of the real vector space Vg.

We wish to define the graded vector spaces Ve “ by assigning each basis state |) nv to one of the
Ve". To make these assignment, we utilise the U(1) charge qz(|c)) of the state |a),;, and define
the pair (p,q) giving the Hodge type of the vector |a) y; as a function of gr({a)).

To obtain a Hodge structure, the assignment of the pair (p,q) to each state must satisfy the
compatibility condition (3.2). By the virtue of the relation (3.10), gz(e(|a))) = —qz(la)) this is
equivalent to requiring

p(—ar(la))) = alar(la))) for alae R. (3.12)

We also need that p and q are non-negative integers, in addition to which we require that these

integers are “minimal” in the sense that

ecd({p(ar(la))), a(ar(la))) ae R})=1, (3.13)

and

p(qu(la))) = g(qr(|8))) =0 for some a, BER. (3.14)

The significance of the first condition (3.13) is exemplified by considering a situation where we
have two states |a) ,|8) € R with gz(|a)) = —c/6 and gz(|8)) = c/6. In this case, we could define
a weight-1 Hodge structure (Vg, Vc) of type [1,1] with Ja) € vg) and |8) € von. However,
without the above condition, we could equally well define a weight-2 Hodge structure (Ug, Uc) of
type [1,0,1] with Ja) € ue and |@) € uO), The condition (3.13) requires that we pick the
Hodge structure (Vg, Vc) of lower weight.

The purpose of the second condition (3.14) is similar. To illustrate it, consider a case where we
have one state |a), a € R with gz(|a)) = 0. Without imposing this condition, we could either
define a weight-0 Hodge structure (Vo, Vc) of the Hodge type [1] with Ja) € vo" or a weight-2
Hodge structure (Ug, Uc) of the type [0,1,0] with |a) € ue). These two are trivially related by
tensoring (twisting) with the dual Q(—1) of the Hodge-Tate structure, which is a one-dimensional
Hodge structure of type (1,1) (see e.g. ref. [74]). The condition (3.14) ensures that we consider
only the Hodge structure (Vo, Vc) of lower weight.

Finally, we require that the functions p(qz,) and q(qr) be linear in gz(|a)).?? A pair (p,q) of linear
functions satisfying these properties are given by??

(ar) = €(5—a) ; q(qL) =e(G +4) ; (3.15)

where we have defined the auxiliary quantity @, which ensures the integrality of p and q, by

é:= lem ({denom(c/6 + gz(|a))) | ae R}). (3.16)

Furthermore, these are the unique such pair of linear function, up to exchanging p with q which
corresponds to complex conjugation, and does therefore not affect the resulting Hodge structure in
any essential way. The choice we have made here is such that for Gepner models it corresponds to
the Hodge structure of the corresponding Calabi-Yau geometry, as we show in section 3.6.

Restricting to linear functions can be justified a posteriori as it turns out that for Gepner models, the Hodge
structures obtained in this way are equal to those obtained from the corresponding Calabi-Yau geometry (see sec-
tion 3.6).

*5In terms of the U(1) charges of the states in the (c,c)
éc/3 —Iqx and q(qx) = qu.

eng TOS these formulae would read simply p(qz) =

20
The positivity of p and q follows from the bound (2.37) together with (2.38), which imply that
lqz(|a))| < ¢/6 for alla € R. The fact that p and q attain the value 0 for some states can be
seen by recalling that the state /|0), where |0) denotes the ground state, saturates the bound
gxi(U |0)) = —c/6. Its conjugate 1(Y/ |0)) then satisfies the bound qz(u(U |0))) = ¢/6.

With this definition, the pair (Vg, Vc) defines a Hodge structure of weight m = p+ q = éc/3.

B-type Hodge structures

We define the B-type Hodge structures to be related to the A-type Hodge structure by the mirror
automorphism [73], which reverses the sign of the right-moving U(1) current. This implies that
the construction of the B-type Hodge structures is based on the (c,a)-ring, though for simplicity
we again restrict to the subring (c,a) an=—4R? where the left-moving U(1)-charge is negative of the
right-moving charge. Since the dependence of A-type Hodge structures in the right-moving states
is given by the left-moving states, it comes as no surprise that the construction of B-type Hodge
structures is almost identical.

Let S be the set of representations whose highest-weight state are RR ground states that are
obtained the spectral flow from (c,a) 24 Then the associated B-type Hodge structure is
given by the complex vector space

Ve = (18) es*, (3.18)

together with the graded pieces

ver ={18)|BeS, 2-aillB)) =F, =+ar(16)) =$} - (3.19)

With these definitions, the complex conjugation map (3.9) maps Vé"? = Vé?, so that we indeed

obtain a Hodge structure of weight m = &

3.3. Rational Hodge structures from rational conformal field theories

For rational conformal field theories, as briefly reviewed in section 2.1, it is possible to explicitly
construct boundary states in practice, which provide extra information that we can use to consis-
tently define a rational structure on the real vector space Vg constructed in the previous section so
that we obtain a rational Hodge structure based on a rational vector space Vo.

In this section, we assume, for simplicity, that sufficiently many boundary states are given by
the Cardy construction and are thus of the form (2.50). This is known to not to be the most
general form of a boundary state, and indeed finding the most general boundary states in a generic
rational conformal field theory is a difficult problem. The construction we present in this section
can in many cases be easily generalised, as we explicitly illustrate via an example in section 5.2,
where we present how our construction works for a Gepner model whose boundary states are not
all given by the Cardy construction. In addition, in this section, we only consider A-type Hodge
structures, as B-type structures can be obtained from these via the mirror automorphism in a
manner described above.

*4When discussing B-type Hodge structures, we take the spectral flow operator to act consistently with mirror
symmetry so that applying U to a state in the (c,a)-ring increases, rather than decreases, the right-moving U(1)-
charge.

21
Rational structure from boundary states

To construct the rational vector space Vg, consider the projection of the boundary states (2.50) to
the space Vc spanned by the RR ground states, consider the projection operator

Pr = dla) a(al » (3.20)

acR

which projects the boundary states to their R-ground states. The projected boundary states |Ba)>p,
A € HWR(A)p, introduced in eqs. (2.55) and (2.56) can be written in terms of this operator as

|Ba)p = Pr|Ba) = >> la)yy(olBa) - (3.21)
aceR

We now define the space Vg to be the space spanned by these boundary states over Q:

ACHWR(A)R
Vo = ( |Ba)p gn (3.22)
To explicitly see how this space is related to the complex vector space Vc spanned by the RR ground
states |a),-, choose any subset B C HWR(A)r with |B] = |R| such that the restriction © := d|g of
» to B is a matrix of full rank. Then the corresponding set {|B4)p|A € B} of projected boundary
states forms a basis of Ve and Vo.

In terms of this basis, we can write the identity operator of Vc as the projection operator to the
complexification of Vg, that is:

I = Pg := |Ba)p d4? 5 (Bale™” := |Ba)p p(BAle™ , (3.23)

where ©4¥ are the entries of the inverse matrix of D, and in the last equation we used D4? to raise
the indices of the bra-vectors: »(B4| := 543,,(Ba| € Vo.

By using this, we can express the normalised basis states |a),- of Vc in terms of the basis of
projected boundary states:

la) yy = Pp |) xv = ema (le) (al Ba) p |B4) p (3.24)

This shows explicitly that Vg defined by eq. (3.22) is a rational vector space of dimg Vg = dime Ve
and that Vc is the complexification of Vo.

Compatibility with complex conjugation

We claim that the pair (Vo, Vc) gives a Hodge structure with complex conjugation given again by
eq. (3.9) so that the rational structure given by the boundary states is compatible with the real
structure Vg constructed in the previous section 3.2. In particular, this immediately implies that
we can again introduce the graded vector spaces Ve “4 by using the definition (3.17) from the case
of the real Hodge structure.

To do this, we just need to check that any state v € Vg is fixed under the complex conjugation
map (3.9). It is enough to show that every projected boundary state |B4)p, A € B, is kept
fixed. Substituting in the form of the generalised Cardy solution (2.51) in eq. (3.21), the projected
boundary state can be expressed as

(3.25)

25 That this set forms a basis of Ve follows from the matrix 5 is of full rank. To see that these form a basis of Vo, by

Polarisation from the Witten index

As demonstrated in the following, for theories where all states in the (c,c) an=an DS have integral
U(1)-charges and that are subject to assumptions made in the previous section, the intersection
matrix (2.56) related to the open-string Witten index (2.55) gives rise to a polarisation of
the constructed rational Hodge structure. However, for theories with fractional U(1)-charges the
intersection matrix (2.56) does not yield a polarisation. We define in the following a twisted version
of the open-string Witten index (2.55). The intersection matrix corresponding to it yields, in some
cases, a polarisation for the constructed rational Hodge structure. Even if this construction is not
applicable, the corresponding Hodge structure can still be polarisable, as we show in section 4.3.

The relationship to the open-string index (2.55) enables us to construct a Q-bilinear function
Vo x Vo + Q on the rational vector space Vg of boundary states. This index can be twisted by
a unitary transformation V central to the N = 2 super-Virasoro algebra [72], which in particular
implies [ei™ 0 V] = 0. We further require that the operator V restricted to the rational vector
space Vg yields a linear map Vig : Vo > Vg. This means that the restricted operator Vie realises
an orthogonal transformation on Vg. Such an operator V allows us to define a twisted Witten index
that gives rise to the Q-bilinear function U : Vg x Vo > Q with

%( |Ba)p »|Ba)p) = p(Bale'™”’V |Bp)p - (3.31)

In order for © to yield a polarisation for the Hodge structure (Vo, Vé"") of weight m = fe the
following conditions have to be fulfilled: First of all, the pairing © must obey condition (3.4), which

?6The coefficient v can always be chosen to be in R since a complex phase cancels out of the definition of the
intersection matrix X.

is to say U( |Bg)p,|Ba)p) = (-1)-Fd( |Ba)p.|Bz)p). This, together with the fact that ¢ has
been chosen such that fe +lgqr(|a)) € Z for all a € R (according to eq. (3.17)), yields the condition

e2in(Jo+S)y-l — Q2in((-IJop-l_ yp yp? = ePit(l-1)Jo (3.32)

In order for the Witten index ¥ twisted by V to yield a polarisation of (Vo, Ve 4) in addition to
eq. (3.32), we still need to check the remaining two conditions (3.5) and (3.6). Let us first extend
the rational paring © to the complex vector space Vc. Since the Hermitian inner product on the
Hilbert space of states is complex anti-linear in the first argument, the definition (3.31) naturally
extends to a paring © on Vc that is complex anti-linear in the first argument. Therefore, to define
a polarisation, we consider the closely related function

Q(lo) ,|8)) = E(e(la)),18)) =e((ale™"V |B) , la) 18) € Ve, (3.33)

where the appearance complex anti-linear complex conjugation map z : Ve — Vc renders the
first argument of Q complex linear. Since . keeps Vg fixed, Q is a complex bilinear extension of
x: Vo — Vo to Ve.

Next, we consider the bilinear pairing Q evaluated for the normalised states |a),-, which form a
basis of Vc. From eq. (3.9), it follows that

Q(1e),y-18).a7) = sgn(Soe(ay) 7") -(C(a)|V |B) 7 - (3.34)

Due to eq. (3.8) and the commutation relation [Jo,V] = 0, it further follows that Q( |a) ,-,|8),-)
is only non-vanishing if the states |C(a)),- and |8),- have the same charges. This implies, with
eq. (2.39), that gz(|a)) = —qz(|8)) and hence |a),y € V2" and |), € Vé@?. Therefore, the
condition (3.5) is indeed fulfilled.

Finally, we calculate for any graded state |a) € VE"

P-4Q(la) , (Ja))) = Pe") OC (a)), Jay) = (a ei7DJoy Ja) , (3.35)

Thus, in order for the Hodge structure (Vg, Vc) to be polarised by Q, the operator ei™(“Voy
must be positive definite, i-e.,

(ale i™DJoy ja) > 0 for any non-zero |a) € VE". (3.36)

A solution to eq. (3.32) and the positivity condition (3.36) is given by the unitary operator
vase | (3.37)

However, V only commutes with the spin-3 currents G* for odd integers , and hence is only
central to the V = 2 super-Virasoro algebra in this case. In section 4, we explicitly confirm that for
A-type N = 2 minimal models of odd levels k, which give rise to odd integers ¢, the Witten index
twisted with the operator ei™(4-1)J0 restricts to a well-defined operator on Vg, which indeed fulfils
all requirements of a polarisation. In particular, if all states in the (c,c) an=an 1S have integral
U(1)-charges so that @ = 1, the operator V is the identity operator. Then the untwisted open-string
Witten index realises a well-defined polarisation.

24
3.4. Hodge structures of complex multiplication type

We now turn to the definition of rational Hodge structures of complex multiplication (CM) type.
There exist several equivalent notions in the literature, and for the purposes of this paper, we use
one that is often convenient for explicit computations. Some other definitions are discussed in
appendix A. The somewhat abstract discussion in this section is exemplified in appendix B.

We first define the concept of a Hodge endomorphism. Let (Vo, Vc) be a Hodge structure of
weight m. Then Hodge endomorphisms are vector space endomorphisms yy : Vg — Vo that preserve
the Hodge decomposition in the sense that their complex linear extensions yc satisfy

ye(Ve") CVE" . (3.38)

The Hodge endomorphisms form a Q-algebra with the multiplication being the function composi-
tion. We denote this algebra as

Endyag(Vo) = {¢ € Hom(Vo, Vo) | ec(VE") CVE} . (3.39)

We say that an irreducible Hodge structure (Vg, Vc) has an E -multiplication?”’ if there exists an em-
bedding of a number field E + Endyag(Vo), which is a Q-algebra morphism. If [EF : Q] = dimg Vo,
and (Vo, Vc) is polarisable, we say that the Hodge structure (Vg, Vc) is of complex multiplica-
tion (CM) type. In this case one can in fact show that Endyag(WG) is commutative, and in fact
isomorphic to a CM field [74].?8

If a Hodge structure (Vg, Vc) is not irreducible, it may be decomposed into finitely many irreducible
substructures Wo

Ve=@we, where We= @Q wee. (3.40)
ael prq=m

To be able to distinguish between polarised and non-polarised cases, we say here that the Hodge
structure (Vg, Vc) has sufficiently many complex multiplications if every irreducible Hodge sub-
structure WG has an E“ multiplication with E® a number field of degree [E* : Q| =dimg Wg. If,
in addition, every irreducible substructure Ws is of CM type in the sense defined above, we say
that (Vo, Vc) is of CM type.

3.5. Hodge structures of CM type from rational conformal field theories

In this section, we will show that the Hodge structure (Vg, Vc) constructed in section 3.3 have
always sufficiently many complex multiplications if the corresponding RCFT satisfies a compat-
ibility condition of the Galois action. This condition, which we will spell out in detail in the
following subsections, essentially states that for any given representation a € R C HWRx,(A), the
suitably-defined action of the Galois group we call Gal(Q(Sq)/Q) on the representations HWRy,(A)
actually closes on the set of representation R. In particular, the arguments presented in this section
are enough to show that, if the Hodge structure is polarised and satisfies this condition, it is of
CM type.”?

27We learned this terminology from Matt Kerr.

*8Recall that a CM field E is defined as a quadratic totally imaginary field extension E/L of some totally real
field L (see e.g. ref. [75]). L is a totally real field if every complex embedding # : L + C has Im(L) C R. A totally
imaginary field is one which cannot be embedded in R. A useful result is that every number field Galois over Q is
either totally real or totally imaginary.

?°Recall from section 3.3 that a polarisation exists for theories with integral U(1) charges in the (C.¢) 9, <gn Ting:
but also for many other examples.

25
The structure of the argument is as follows: We first show that for any a € R there exists a tower
of Galois extensions Q(S) D> Q(Sa) D Q(Sa)S* DB Q, which we will define in detail below. We
then show that, the Galois action corresponding to Q(Sq) a) maps suitably normalised the basis
states |a) 5, a € R of Ve to another basis state. As these basis states have definite U(1) charges, they
belong to one of the spaces Ven defined in eq. (3.17). It is then shown that the space W spanned
by the Galois images of |a)., gives the complex space corresponding to a Hodge substructure, and
in this way we are able to find how the Hodge structure splits. Finally, we argue that it is possible
construct enough Hodge endomorphisms and the embedding of a number field E 4 Endyag(Vo)
by considering multiplication of |a) by the primitive generator ¢ of Q(Sq)St>) = Q(C).

The Galois groups and their actions

Let (Vo, Vc) be a Hodge structure constructed as in section 3.3, and let |B4), A € B be a basis of
Vo, and let |a),;, a € N be the normalised RR ground states corresponding to the states in the
(C.©)q,=qn Tins:

We first show that we can find states |a), which are proportional to the normalised states |a) ,- € Vc
such that |a)7 in fact live in the vector space Vg®@gQ(S), where Q(S) is the field extension generated
by the elements S,; of the modular S-matrix, as defined in eq. (2.27). To see this, substitute in the
formula (3.24) the expression (2.50) for a boundary state given by the Cardy construction:

la) = tially, S* ad, |BA),, (3.41)
AcB V —
where we used the fact that the normalised boundary states satisfy the relation ,-(a|#)) = dai with

the Ishibashi states |i)), i ¢ HWRy,(A).°° Thus, for any a € R, we can define the states

In fact, it turn out to be useful to define the subextensions Q(S_) C Q(S), where

QSa) = Q({Sea| A € B}) = Q({Saa| A € HWRx(A)R}) , (3.43)

so that in fact
la)z € Vo ®Q Q(Sa) - (3.44)

The extension Q(S,) is a Galois extension since it is a subextension of the Galois extension Q(S)
with an Abelian Galois group. From elementary Galois theory (see e.g. Theorem VI.1.10 of
ref. [76]), it follows that there is a surjective restriction morphism

lesa) + Gal(Q(S)/Q) > Gal(Q(Sa)/Q) , (3.45)

which means that we can express any element p € Gal(Q(Sq)/Q) as a restriction clgg,) of an
element o € Gal(Q(S)/Q).

The action of the Galois group Gal(Q(Sq)/Q) can be extended to act on Vg ®g Q(Sq) in a natural
way, by defining that every p € Gal(Q(S.)/Q) acts trivially on the elements of Vg. Since |a) 7 can be
interpreted as an element of Vg ®gQ(Sa), we have a natural action of p on it: Let o € Gal(Q(S)/Q)

°°'This follows from the normalisation for the Ishibashi states chosen in (2.41), together with the assumption that
we have picked the algebra A so that each irreducible representation contains at most a single super-Virasoro primary

state in the (c,c),, _,,,-ting, see page 17.

26
be any element of the Galois group of Q(S) such that it restricts to p, so that olgg,) = p. Then,
recalling the formulae (2.29), the action of p on the S-matrix elements Sq is given by

P(Sad) = €o(@)S(a)A =! €p(@)So(a)A + where ép(a) € {—1,+1} , (3.46)

and we defined new notation €)(@) := €¢(a) and o(a) := ¢(a) to emphasise that we only consider
the Galois action of elements p of Gal(Q(S,)/Q) and not of the full group Gal(Q(S)/Q) studied in
section 2.3. Using the above formula, the action on the states |a)7 is

d oSaa)|BA)p = YO e(@)Sica)41B4)p = ela) |0(0))z » (3.47)
AeB AgB

p\a)r

where we have also implicitly used the fact that since the Galois group Gal(Q(S)/Q) is Abelian,
the Galois action commutes with the complex conjugation. Note that the last expression makes
sense only if the representation 0(a@) also belongs to the set R, and thus there is a corresponding
suitably-normalised highest-weight state |o(a))7. This is true in all cases known to us, but we do
not know a general proof for this, so take this as an assumption.

Let us make this assumption more precise. For a given a € R, we have described above the Galois
group Gal(Q(Sq)/Q) and the map g. Using this, we can define the set of representations

Ra = { o(a) | p€ Gal(Q(Sa)/Q) } = Im(o) © HWRy«(A) - (3.48)
Then, by definition, g is a well-defined map
0: Ra Ra - (3.49)
The assumption is that the set of representations Rq is actually a subset of R, that is,
Ra CR forany a€R. (3.50)

We refer to this condition as compatibility of R-ground states with the Galois action. Note also that,
by construction, Q(Sy) = Q(Sg) for any 8 € Ra, which implies Gal(Q(S,)/Q) = Gal(Q(Ss)/Q).
Splitting of the Hodge structure

Given a state |a)7, a € R, let us define W§ as the smallest subset Wg C Vo such that the state |a)7
belongs to its complexification WE := Wo ®g C. We will now provide an explicit construction of
these spaces and argue that these provide Hodge substructures of the Hodge structure (Vg, Vc)
constructed in section 3.3.

By the primitive element theorem the field extension Q(S,) can be generated by a single element
¢ € Q(Sq) with a minimal polynomial of degree n := [Q(Sa) : Q) = |Gal(Q(Sa)/Q)|. Hence every
modular S-matrix element 5%, can be expanded as a rational linear combination of powers of ¢,
and the state Ja); can be written as

n-1
lo)r = SOC IQR) with |QR) € Vo, (3.51)
k=0

where the states |Q¢) are rational linear combinations of the boundary states |B4), A € B, uniquely
defined by the expression above. Clearly then the space Ws can be written as the Q-span

We = (1Q5),---:1Qn-a) Je» (3.52)

27
and its complexification W& contains any of the Galois conjugates p|a)7 of |a), and in particular
their complex conjugates.

In fact, the Galois conjugates of |); span the complexification W@. To prove this, we will show
that the number of linearly independent Galois conjugates of |a), equals the dimension of the
vector space wg. Note that from eq. (3.52), it follows that dimg Wg < n = |Gal(Q(Sa)/Q)|.
Therefore, if the Galois conjugates p|a)7 of |a)7 are linearly independent for all p € Gal(Q(Sq)/Q),
we are done, since in this way we get n = |Gal(Q(Sa)/Q)| independent vectors in Wé.

Assume then that there exists a set non-trivial Q-automorphisms {po,..., Pn} C Gal(Q(S.)/Q),

such that |a)7 is linearly dependent over C. That is, for some complex constants Gaye
n! n!
ja); = So esps la); = Ye esep,(@) las(a))z7 , (3.53)
s=0 s=0

By definition |a) and |8)7 are only linearly dependent over C if a = 6. Therefore, for the above
equality to hold, we must have that for at least one p,, it holds that 0,(a@) = a. Let us study the
subgroup of Gal(Q(S,)/Q) whose elements have this property:

Stab(a) := {px € Gal(Q(S_)/Q) | ox(a) = a} (3.54)
From eq. (3.46), it follows that for any p, € Stab(a)
px(Saa) = Soa or px(Saa) = —Saa forall AEB. (3.55)

Since Saa, A € B generate Q(S,) over Q, the former being true implies that p, is the identity
element, whereas the latter condition implies that p, is a non-trivial element of order two. In fact
Stab is of order two, as if we have two morphisms p, and p’, satisfying the latter condition, it follows
that p, 0 p!, = I, implying that p’, = py! = p,. Therefore Stab(q) is generated by p, that is either
of order 2 or trivial:

Stab(a) = (px) with ord(py) <2. (3.56)
Since Gal(Q(Sq)/Q) is Abelian, Stab(a) is normal, and we can define the quotient group

Gal(Q(Sa)/Q) _ Gal(Q(Sa)/Q)

Stab(a) (px) Gan

If the subgroup Stab(a) is trivial, then by definition, all Galois conjugates of |a)7 are linearly
independent, which is a contradiction. Let us therefore concentrate on the case where ord(p,) = 2
in which case px satisfies p.(Saa) = —Saa for all A € B, and thus p, |) = —|a) 7.

Using the fundamental theorem of Galois theory we then obtain a tower of field extensions

n

Q(Sa) > QSa)" 3, where [QSq): O(Sa)] = 2, [O(S.):Q] = 5+ (358)
Applying the primitive element theorem twice tell us that

Q(Sa) = Q(Sa) (6) = QM.) , (3.59)

3!This is equal to the complex dimension of the complexification since the boundary states |B4), A € B, and
hence the states |Q{) are linearly independent over C (see footnote 25).

*Note that this is equivalent to the seemingly more general condition p la)z = Ey ps |a)z with p F ps.

28
where we can choose € to satisfy €? + « = 0 for some « € Q(7),°? and the minimal polynomial of
7 a polynomial of order n/2. By definition, ps leaves the elements of Q(Sa)*) = Q(n) invariant,

so since it is not trivial, it must act non-trivially on €, that is to say p,(7) = 7 and p,(€) = —€.
Therefore, due to px |a)7 = — |a)z we can write the state |a)7 as
n/2-1
la)r =€ D> n° |Q2) , where |Q%) € Vo. (3.60)
a=0

Thus, we see that in fact Wo is given by

= (|Q2) Jo» (3.61)
and therefore dimg Wg < n/2 = |Gal(Q(Sa)/Q)/(p«)|-

Now we note that €-!|a)z € Vo @g Q(Sa)S**(™. We can, as earlier, define a natural action of
Gal(Q(Sq)*# /Q) on the vectors in Ve Bg Q(Sq)8#>(™, by demanding that the action keeps Vo
fixed. By the the restriction theorem (3.45), this action coincides with that obtained by restricting
the action of Gal(Q(S.)/Q) to Ve @g Q(Sq) 5).

Now consider the Galois conjugates of

)Stab(o Gal(Q(Sa)/Q)
/Q) = (p)

All these Galois conjugates are linearly independent, as can be seen by the following simple argu-
ment: Let p € Gal(Q(S,)/Q) be an automorphism such that it restricts to 0, that is Pla(sa)stab(o) =
0. Then we have that

9(E* |a)z) = p(E* la)z) = p(E“" ala) z) = P(E ep) [9(@))z - (3.63)

Using this result, we can, as before, argue that to have that the states given by the Galois con-
jugates are linearly dependent, there must exist a non-trivial 6 € Gal(Q(Sq \Stabla: )/ Q) such that
the corresponding p keeps the representation a fixed, that is e(@) = a. But if such @ existed,
then by definition p € Stab(a), and hence p acts trivially on Q(Sq)8#?(™. From this it follows
that 9 = plgg,ystav(a) = I, which is a contradiction. Thus we have shown that all Galois conju-
gates (3.62) are linearly independent over C.

This shows that the Galois conjugates give |Gal(Q(S,)5**(“) /Q)| = |Gal(Q(8,)/Q)/Stab(a)| = n/2

independent vectors in W¢. It follows from eq. (3.61) hat dimg Wg < n/2 so the Galois conjugates
necessarily span the complexification W@, and in fact dim Wg = n/2.

0(€"|a)z) , with  6@€ Gal(Q(Sa (3.62)

To unify the notation, we introduce the conveniently scaled states
ja), if |Stab(a@)| =
Ops = ‘ 3.64
la)s leu if |Stab(a) _ ~ St Qk) (3-64)
where |Q@) € Vo, Q(Sq)S*#™ = Q(¢), and n = |Gal(Q(S,)8**( /Q)|. The main utility of these
states is that, irrespective of the structure of Stab(q), ee belong to Vo ®g Q(Sq)*#). Thus

we have shown that in every case we can write W@ as

WE = (Bar) \ECMSaIN/Q) | (3.65)

*3Since the extension Q(€,7)/Q(n) is of degree 2, we know that € must satisfy a quadratic polynomial with
coefficients in Q(7). By redefining € by a shift by a constant required to complete the square, we can always take €
to satisfy the equation €? + « = 0, where & € Q(n).

29
From this it directly follows that the space Wo satisfies the condition (3.3) required of a Hodge
substructure, as by eqs. (3.47) and (3.63) for every 6 € Gal(Q(Sq)5*#>(™ /Q)

_ €o(a) |o(a))z if |Stab(a)| =1
Ola)s = 4 -
P(E )ep(a@) |o(a)) ¢ |Stab(a)| = 2

where again p € Gal(Q(S.)/Q) is an automorphism that restricts to 6, and as before, we have
defined €g(a) := €,(a) and Y(a) := o(a) to emphasise that we are considering automorphisms
6 € Gal(Q(Sq)5*) /Q). By definition |o(@)) 4, belongs to one of the subspaces V? determined
by its charges, which shows that the condition (3.3) is satisfied.

\ x |o(@)) (3.66)

b:

Existence of Hodge endomorphisms

We finish the proof by showing that the Hodge structure (Vg, Vc) has enough complex multipli-
cations, and is thus of CM type if it is polarised. This requires that we prove that every Hodge
substructure Wg admits an E°-multiplication by a number field E° ~ Q(So) Stab) of degree
[E* : Q| = dimg Wo . We do this by constructing Hodge endomorphisms acting on the irreducible
pieces W5 as maps induced on the rational vector space Wo by multiplying the state |a); by
any € € Q(S,)St@) = Q(C), where we have introduced ¢ to denote the generator of the field
Q(Sa)Stab(@) discussed in the previous subsection. These endomorphisms will then be in obvious
correspondence with the elements of the number field Q(¢), allowing us to explicitly construct the
embedding E* ~ Q(¢) > Endyag(W6).

To see how we can define the endomorphism y? : W$ — W6§ corresponding to the multiplication
of |a)5 by €, recall (see e.g. ref. [76]) that a field extension Q(¢) can be thought of as a Q-vector
space whose basis we can take to be given by the powers of ¢:

QC) = (1,6,---,.0° Jo - (3.67)

Multiplication by € can be then thought of as a Q-linear map € - * : Q(¢) + Q(¢), and thus it can
be represented by a Q-valued matrix T(€) € Mat(nxn, Q) so that

n-1
CRs gC = SU TEC. (3.68)
s=0
Using the form (3.64) of |a) 5, we can write the state €|a) 5 as
n-1
Ela)s = $7 CT(ES. IQR) - (3.69)
k,s=0

We can therefore define ve : Wo > Wo as the Q-linear map corresponding to the Q-valued matrix
T(E), that is

ve (lQk)) = T(E)", 1Q3) - (3.70)
Then from the above equation (3.69), it follows directly that the C-linear extension of ye maps
vec (le)s) = lads » (3.71)

so it indeed corresponds to multiplying the state |a) 5 by €.

We can easily find the action of the C-linear map Pec on the full space Wé by using the fact that
by eq. (3.65) this space has a basis given by the Galois conjugates @|a) 5, 0 € Gal(Q(S,.)8>( /Q),

30
of the state |a);. Since we have defined the Galois conjugation so that it leaves the states in Wo
invariant, we can now simply use the properties of the field automorphism 0 to find the action of

vec on pla)s:

n-1 nol n-1

“ — bso (3.72)
=D 9(EC*) QS) = A(€) D _ O(C°) OS) = 9(8)8 la) s
s=0 s=0

Thus we see that in the basis of W spanned by the Galois conjugates 6 |a) 5, 0 € Gal(Q(Sa)**#() /Q),
of |a)5, the map ec is diagonalised, acting on the basis state 6a) 5 by multiplication by 6(¢).

Since every 0 |) 5 belongs to one of the subspaces We © and together the conjugates in fact span
these spaces, this means that vec preserves the Hodge structure,

inlwe™) cwe . (3.73)

Let us denote the algebra generated by ye, € € Q(¢) by B®. Any two Hodge endomorphisms
ge, %y € E* clearly satisfy the relations

PE°%n = Pins YEtn = Ein > (3.74)

From these it follows that E® is isomorphic to the field Q(¢), with the isomorphism given by
ye + € Thus we see that each Wg has £°-multiplication with E* ~ Q(¢). This finishes the proof
that for any rational conformal field theory satisfying the compatibility condition (3.50), the Hodge
structure defined in section 3.3 has sufficiently many complex multiplications. In particular, the
Hodge structure is of CM type if it is polarised.

3.6. Hodge structures of non-linear sigma model Calabi-Yau target spaces

To motivate the construction of Hodge structures from conformal field theories, we connect our
discussion on conformal field theories to two-dimensional non-linear sigma models with geometric
target spaces. It is well established that a two-dimensional NV = (2,2) non-linear sigma model with
a complex n-dimensional Calabi-Yau target space X realises a N = (2,2) superconformal field
theory with central charge c = 3n at its infrared fixed point [19, 77-79]. In the following we relate
the constructed Hodge structures of the NV = (2,2) superconformal field theories to the Hodge
structures of the middle cohomology H?1,,(X,Q) of the Calabi-Yau manifold X.

Chiral ring elements and cohomology of Calabi- Yau manifolds

Let g(-,-) be the Kahler metric of the Calabi-Yau manifold X and R(-,-)- the Riemann tensor
of the Levi-Civita connection of the Calabi-Yau metric g(-,-). The map y : © > X realises
the non-linear sigma model scalar fields embedding the two-dimensional oriented worldsheet © into
the target space X. The Grassmann-odd fields UY and W are the fermionic superpartners of the
scalar fields y, which for a choice of spin structure on are respectively sections of the
chiral and anti-chiral spin bundles with values in the complexified tangent bundles of TXclys) =
(TUX @ TOY X) |y(x) restricted to the embedded worldsheet (=). Then the NV’ = (2,2) non-
linear sigma model action Syiom reads [19, 20, 80]

coordinates together with their worldsheet tangent vectors (0z,0z) of the complexified tangent
vector space T(,,2)% @ C, and the Dirac operators D, and Dz act on the spin bundles of the

ermionic fields W and W.

While the non-linear sigma model action (3.75) with Calabi-Yau target manifold X is not conformal,
it has an anomaly-free U(1); x U(1)r R-symmetry [19, 20, 80]. With respect to this R-symmetry,
he scalar fields y are neutral, and the chiral and anti-chiral fermionic fields V and U respectively
split into section V(b and WO) of charges (1,0) and into sections U9) and WO of charges
0,1). Under the renormalisation group flow, the non-linear sigma model (3.75) flows in the
infrared to a conformal fixed point, at which the supersymmetry generators enhance to the left-
and right-moving spin-3 currents G* and the generators of the U(1), yr R-symmetry augment to
he left- and right-moving U(1) currents J. Thus the infrared fixed point becomes a non-trivial
N = (2,2) superconformal field theory with central charge c = 3dimc X = 3n [20].

In order to quantise the fermionic fields, we expand the left-moving fermionic fields into a basis
of holomorphic tangent and co-tangent section and the right-moving fields into a basis of anti-
holomorphic tangent and co-tangent sections of the Calabi-Yau target manifold X as*4

Qt [piPD) = ry a oly, 2) es no Wis Vip oh... abla 0) . (3.82)

Hence, on the level of the sections (3.80), the operator Qt becomes the Dolbeault operator
8: 2-9 (X) @ PTO X + OAD (X) @ APTOOX. On the other hand, the operator Qt flows
in the infrared to the mode (ean j2 of the spin-3 current G* (Z) of the resulting two-dimensional
N = (2,2) superconformal field theory. Therefore, according to eq. (2.34) the 0-closed sec-
tions (3.80) correspond in the infrared to anti-chiral primary states, which as a consequence
of {G", jo Gry j2} = 0 — are only non-zero if the d-closed sections (3.80) are not O-exact. Hence,
the anti-chiral primary states map to sheaf cohomology elements [20, 80]

where the isomorphism of these cohomology groups is realised by contracting the sheaf of wedge
products of tangent vectors with the unique holomorphic (n,0)-form of the complex n-dimensional
Calabi-Yau manifold X.

Repeating the above arguments with the left-moving zero mode Q* [20], one arrives at the condition
that anti-chiral states are chiral if and only if the associated 0-closed (p,q)-forms are co-closed as
well. That is to say elements of the (c,c)-ring with charge (p,q) are in one-to-one correspondence
to harmonic (p,q)-forms in H-?:) (X), which are again isomorphic to the Dolbeault cohomology
groups er (a= Pax ). Thus the renormalization group flow to the infrared fixed-point of the VN =
(2,2) non- “linear sigma model induces the isomorphism [20, 80]

RG: HY? (X) = He (3.84)

Here Hes denotes the subspace of (c,c)-states with U(1) charges (p,q) of the Hilbert space of
states H of the infrared NV = (2,2) superconformal field theory.

Hodge Structures of Two-Dimensional N = (2,2) non-Linear Sigma Models

Given the correspondence between the (c,c)-ring of MV = (2,2) non-linear sigma models and the
Dolbeault cohomology of the n-dimensional Calabi-Yau target space according to eq. (3.84), we can
now spell out the Hodge structure of weight n discussed in sect. 3.2 for a. N = (2,2) superconformal
field theory. Applying to the subring (c,c) oema the renormalization group flow isomorphism RG
of eq. (3.84) combined with the spectral flow operator U, we arrive at the isomorphism

UoRG: H"(X,C) ~ Huger —=SR, (3.85)

in terms of the previously defined set R of RR ground states. The isomorphism U/ o RG is a graded
map of vector spaces, as a (n — r,r)-form Dolbeault cohomology representative a is mapped to a

defined in eq. (3.17), and we obtain the

UoRG: HE (xX) = . (3.86)

with the real structure
UoRG: H"(X,R) —> Ve. (3.87)

Hence, for two-dimensional MN = (2,2) supersymmetric non-linear sigma models U/ o RG is an
isomorphism between the Hodge structure of the complex and real middle dimensional cohomology
groups (H"(X,C), H"(X,R)) and the Hodge structure of the RR ground states (Vc, Vg) defined in
eqs. (3.7) and (3.11).

The rational singular cohomology group Ting (X ,Q) of the Calabi-Yau manifold X gives the com-
plex middle dimensional cohomology group a canonical rational structure (H”(X, C), Heng (X ,Q)),
where Fgng(X ,Q) is Poincaré dual to the middle-dimensional homology group H,(X,Q). Their
n-cycle homology elements represent (rational linear combinations of) Lagrangian submanifolds
known as A-type branes [81], which serve as A-type boundary conditions of the two-dimensional
non-linear sigma model space-time, ie. plan : OX > By C X [68, 82]. A set of a A-branes, which
yields a basis y4, A = 1,...,dimg H,(X, Q), of homology n-cycles classes in H,(X,Q), is Poincaré
dual to a basis [y4] of Hiye(X,Q). Such a basis enjoys on the level of cohomology the expansion

As argued in detail in ref. [81], the isomorphism U/ o RG maps the cohomology class [ya] to the
projected boundary state |B,4)p, such that the above expansion becomes

|Ba)p = >> cA) la) . (3.89)

Hence, the canonical rational structure on the middle dimensional cohomology H"(X,C) of the
non-linear sigma model target space X becomes the previously introduced rational structure Vo
given in eq. (3.22) in terms of projected boundary states of the conformal field theory at the infrared
fixed-point.

Note that the expansion coefficients c*(A) depend continuously on the (complex structure) moduli
of the two-dimensional N = (2,2) supersymmetric non-linear sigma model [81]. While the con-
formal field theories obtained from such non-linear sigma models give rise to the rational Hodge
structure (Vc, Vg), for generic values of the complex structure moduli these Hodge structures are
not of CM type.

4. Hodge Structures of CM Type from NM=2 Minimal Models

As a first example, we show that the Hodge structure constructed in section 3 has sufficiently many
complex multiplications for all NM = 2 minimal models with left-right symmetric spectrum, which
implies together with a polarisation that we have a Hodge structure of CM type. Given the proof
in the previous section 3.5, to establish this, it would suffice just to check that we have enough
boundary states and that the compatibility condition (3.50) of the Galois action with R-ground
states is satisfied. However, to illustrate the discussion in section 3.5 in more concrete terms, we
keep the discussion here mostly self-contained, rederiving many results of section 3.5 explicitly.
Apart from providing an important class of examples, this section also serves to illustrate that our
construction is independent of the N = 2 superconformal field theory having a geometric origin.

c= es are most conveniently realised through the coset construction introduced in refs. [83, 84].

In the following, all conformal field theory quantities, like the S-matrix, are written in terms of
irreducible highest weight representations of the chiral algebra

Az su(2)e @ u(1)2 (4.1)
U(Li+2
which yield the representations
HWRx(A) = {(l,m,s) € Z x Z/2(k+2)Z x Z/4Z|0<1<k, l+m+s=0 mod 2}/~ , (4.2)
where the equivalence relation is obtained from the coset construction.
(l,m,s) ~ (k-l,m+k+2,5+42). (4.3)
In the following, we often choose explicit representative for m and s such that —k—1<m<k+2

and s € {0,2,+1}. When s € {0,2}, the corresponding state is in the NS sector, while s € {+1}
corresponds to the R sector.

The spectral flow operator U/ corresponds to the highest-weight state of the representation (0,—1,—1),
and the supercurrents G* belong to the representation (0, 0,2). We also utilise the following fusion
products (see e.g. ref. [50])

(0,—1,-1) x (l,m,s) = (lym—1,s—1), (0,0,2) x (l,m,s) = (l,m,s+2). (4.4)

The states in the (c,c qeaga HE defined in section 3.2 are exactly the chiral states, which are
labelled by |J,—J,0). From the above fusion rules we see that under the action of the spectral flow
operator U, these map into the states |I, —(/ + 1), —1), so the set R of representations defined above
eq. (3.7) is given by

R = {(l.—(l41),-1) |0<1<k}. (4.5)
For ease of notation we abbreviate in the following the representation labels in the set R as
r(l) := (1, -(141), -l) ER. (4.6)

Later, in section 5, we will make significant use of the fractional parts of the conformal weights and
U(1) charges of the highest-weight states, so we will make use of the following identities:

I(l+2)—m? — s? m

h(|l,m,s)) = ————— + z mod 1, qz(l,m,s)) = -——+

s
§ modl. (4.
A(k-+2) kya Q 0 (47)

35
It turns out that the above expression for the U(1) charge is exact for the states in R, so that

k— 21

au(Ir())) = ~4A42k°

(4.8)

For future reference, we note also the monodromy charges which follow from the definition (2.13)
of the monodromy charge together with the formulae (4.7) for the conformal weights

00,2) ((1,m, 8)) = mod 1. (4.9)
Note that the combination (I,m, s) @ (l,m,s + 2) realises a full irreducible WV = 2 super Virasoro
module [48]. The individual (J, m,s) representations correspond to primary fields with respect to
the bosonic subalgebra of the Nv = 2 Virasoro algebra. Note that it is this bosonic subalgebra that
is the chiral algebra A = Amax according to the definition given earlier, c.f. sections 2.1 and 2.4.

The modular S-matrix elements are given by

S(im,s),(L,M,S) = i - y sin (; “ 5 + 1)(L4 1)) exp (; “ sma) exp (-iZss)
(4.10)

where
Cy = erin | (4.11)

For purposes of illustration, we now go through the steps of the general construction presented in the
previous section for the diagonal V = 2 minimal models, where diagonal refers to a decomposition
into left- and right-moving irreducible representations of the N = 2 super-Virasoro algebra.
4.1. The complex vector space Vc and rational vector space Vo
For the VV = 2 minimal model of level k the complex vector space Vc is given in terms of the
representation labels (4.6) by

Ve:= (Irv lOSIS ke, VEt= (ID)ylk-l=p,l=a)e- (4:12)

To obtain this from eq. (3.17), we have used the expression (4.8) for the U(1)-charge of the states,
and we have taken ¢ = k + 2 ensuring that p and q are integral and minimal in the sense explained
in section 3.2.

In section 3.2, we have shown that this defines a real Hodge structure of weight k if we define the
complex conjugation on Vc by the complex antilinear map 4 : Ve — Ve which acts on the basis
vectors |r(/)) a, by (cf. eq. (3.9))

H(r()) ar) = sgn(So,0,0),(41,1)) KR - Dy = ek -D)y (4.13)

where we have used that

C(r(l)) = r(k-1), and sen(So,0,0),(41,1)) = sgn (sia (43) = 1: (4.14)

Then the real vector space Vg is defined as the space spanned by vectors v € Ve invariant under
the action of . To check that the pair (Vg, Vc) defines a real Hodge structure, note that for any

36
p = 0, we can write any vector v € Ve oP as v = a|r(p)),- for some a € C. Under 1, this gets
mapped to the state

iv) = a*|r(k—p))y ever? . (4.15)

Therefore « indeed maps Vé"" + V@? for any p, as required by eq (3.2), verifying that (Vg, Vc) is
a real Hodge structure.

As in section 3.3, since N = 2 minimal models are rational, we can construct a rational Hodge
structure by defining the rational vector space Vg as the space spanned by the projected boundary
states (3.21) labelled by highest-weight representations (L,.M,S) € HWRy(A)r, that is the labels
obey the same conditions (4.2) with S € {—1, 1}.

In terms of the modular S-matrix values, the correctly normalised projected boundary states are

given by [68, 70]

S(1,M,S),r()
|But,M,s)) p = Vay Seat et (4.16)

For NV = 2 minimal models, it is always possible to choose a subset B C HWRy(A)p of represen-
tations such that |B] = k + 1 = dime Ve and the matrix ©, defined by

X(1,M,8),(L',M!,S") = p(Biiu,s)| e"”° |Buy.m,s)) p (4.17)

is of full rank when (L,M,S),(L’, M’,S’) € B [68, 70]. As discussed in footnote 25, this is enough
to show that the set

{|Buars))p | (L,M,S) €B}, (4.18)
forms a basis of Vg.

Recalling the discussion around (3.33), for VM = 2 minimal models, we can construct a polarisation
Q: Vo — Vo from a twisted Witten index by setting, as in eq. (3.33),

Q(la) ,18)) = u((ale™**% |B), Ja) ,|8) € Ve, (4.19)

if V = e™(*+1)0 is central to the V = 2 super-Virasoro algebra and defines a map Vo > Vo. From
section 3.3, we know that V can only be central if the level k is odd. In these cases V indeed gives
a well-defined map Vg — Vg, which follows from the formula [67, 68, 82]

lV Bir us))p = |Bum+esi,S+k+1))p > (4.20)

where we have to take into account the equivalence relation (4.3).

For minimal models with even level k, we cannot obtain a polarisation from the Witten index.
Nevertheless, for the first few even levels k, we have explicitly checked that a polarisation can be
constructed. At the end of this section, we will illustrate the construction of a polarisation in the
case k = 4.

4.2. Hodge substructures and Hodge endomorphisms
We proceed to explicitly construct the Hodge substructures of the Hodge structure associated with
the N = 2 minimal models at level k. To do so, we first find the field extensions Q(S,(); the

stabiliser group Stab(r(l)) and the fixed field QS.) tAPEO) for every representation r(l) defined
in eq. (4.6).°° The stabiliser group turns out to be trivial in every case, so to illustrate the case with

*Note that since Q(S) is Galois and Gal(Q(S)/Q) is Abelian, all subfields are Galois over Q.

37
non-trivial stabilisers, in appendix C we consider the case where the boundary states are taken to
be in the NS-sector. This analysis ultimately leads to the same conclusion, but involves non-trivial
stabiliser groups.

In order to construct the number field Q(S,j)), we observe that the modular S-matrix (4.10) for
the representations r(l) € R, c.f. eq. (4.6), can be written as

Ss. y,
S _ (prt Wi\ 2 1 cH )(L+1) (4.21)
rOMLMS) = TEL Ce42 - Ge ‘ .
Since (LZ, M, S') € HWR7(A)r, which implies that $+ 1 and L — M +1 are even, it is clear from
this formula that Q(5,7)) © Q(¢j44)- To see that in fact Q(S,qy) = Q(¢f4}), it is then sufficient
to note that

SrOOt1) ate

Thus we have that
, bo
Q(ISry) = QlCx) with k= ———_... (4.23)

ged (1+ 1,k +2)
For the construction of the number field Q(S,, (poe ©), we first determine the action of the Galois
group Gal(Q(S,(1))/Q) on the representations rl ) € R. The utilised key results are that the Galois
groups of Abelian field extensions generated by the primitive n’th root of unity ¢, is isomorphic to
the multiplicative group of units of the ring Z/nZ, that is to say

Gal(Q(Gn)/Q) ~ (Z/nZ)* (4.24)

As a consequence of Bézout’s lemma the elements [a] of (Z/nZ)* are represented by integers a
coprime to n. Under the isomorphism (4.24), the element [a] € (Z/nZ)* corresponds to the Galois
automorphism pa € Gal(Q(¢n)/Q), which acts on the primitive root of unity ¢n as

a: Gp Gh = (4.25)

Let pa € Gal(Q(¢,.)/Q) be the Galois automorphism corresponding to [a] € (Z/KZ)*. It transforms
the primitive root anes as

(1+1) is
ay = GS = (4.26)

where I’ is the unique integer such that

0<I<k and V=a(l+1)-1 modk+2. (4.27)

It is a priori clear that such an integer exists in the range 0 < l/<k+1. To see that ’ Ak+1,
note that by definition a is invertible modulo k+2, so I! = k+1 would imply +1 = 0 mod k+2,
which is not possible for 0 < 1 < k. As a consequence, the Galois automorphism pa acts on the
modular S-matrix (4.21) as

Pa(Sr(t),(L,M,8)) = Sp(t),(L,M,S) + (4.28)

which on the set of representations R induces the action

00: ROR, r(J) + r(I') (4.29)

From this we can also easily show that the stabiliser subgroup is Stab(r(/)) trivial. For a given
representation r(1) € R we need to calculate the conjugacy classes [a] € (Z/KZ)* with oq(r(l)) =
r(l), which, according to eq. (4.27), amounts to solving the equation

(i+ 1) (k + 2)

L(i+1) = Ak+2 i = for \ EZ. (4.

Any solution to this equation is for the form

a l+mrk withmeZ. (4.31)

As the classes [a] are represented by integers a modulo «, [a] = [1 + «] = [1] and the stabiliser
group Stab(r(/)) is is trivial. Consequently, the invariant number field QS, bE O) is given, in
all cases, by
QS) = ASH) = WGe) , (4.32)
and the conveniently scaled vectors |r(l)) 5 defined in eq. (3.64) in terms of the states |r(I))7 (see
eq. (3.42)) are given simply by
r@))s = Oz € Ve Se QC) (4.33)

On these states, the field automorphisms 0, € Gal(Q(¢,)/Q) corresponding to the elements [a] €
(Z/KZ)* act as

6. |r(1)) = |Wa(r())) =|[r()) , with O<U'<k and '=a(l+1)—1 modk+2. (4.34)

Hodge substructures and their endomorphisms

The rest of the proof follows now exactly as in section 3.5. To keep this section self-contained, we
retrace the main steps of the proof here. More details on the argument made here can be found in
section 3.5. We first find the Hodge substructure wr corresponding to the representation r(I).
As in eq. (3.64), we can now expand the rescaled vector eq. (4.33) in powers of ¢,:

d-1
Ir())5 = So oP Qi) , (4.35)

m=0

where Qn) € Vo and d := [Q(¢x) : Q). Following eq. (3.52), we then define the subspaces

We? = (105). 1QA) ) Cc Ve- (4.36)

From the expansion (4.35), it is clear that the complexification we of this space contains all Galois
conjugates @|r(1))5 with @ € Gal(Q(¢.)/Q). We have seen above in eq. (4.34), that each Galois
conjugate corresponds to a different representation, and hence @|r(/))g¢ are linearly independent
over C. There are exactly d = [Q(¢,) : Q| = |Gal(Q(¢,)/Q)| such states, so they form a basis of
the complexification:
L d€Gal Ke

WE = (BIn(d) 5 ECMO | (437)
From eq. (4.34), comparing to the definition (4.12) of the subspaces V2’7, it also follows that each
Galois conjugate @ |r(I)) 5 lies in one of these spaces. Thus, we” gives a Hodge substructure.
Finally, we establish the existence of sufficiently many Hodge endomorphisms on these Hodge
substructures. We do this by considering the multiplication by ¢,, on Q(¢,,). Recall that the field
extension Q(¢,) can be regarded as a Q-vector space with the basis

Qe) = (der Ya - (4.38)

Multiplication by ¢, is a linear map on this Q-vector space that is described by
d-1
ee oe STC ee (4.39)
n=0

39
where the matrix T(¢,) € Mat(dxd,Q) defined by the equality is called the companion matrix of
the minimal polynomial of ¢,.

r(1)

We can now define an endomorphism
on the basis in eq. (4.36) as

r(1)

on the rational vector space Wo by defining its action

1
£0 (1Q8)) = TEx) m IQ) « (4.40)
A small amount of algebra reveals the action of the complex linear extension ve on the basis of

the complexification we given in eq. (4.37). For any 6 € Gal(Q(¢x)/Q),

l
gee Olr()s) = SS O(TGe)"n G2) 1H) = Ge) D9 ”) QR) = O(n) |r())5 - (4.41)

We conclude that, in the basis of eq. (4.37), the complex linear extension Le, uf - is diagonalised. In
particular, it preserves the Hodge decomposition,
go, (we ),(p.9) ’) c wale) , (4.42)

and is therefore a Hodge endomorphism. It generates a commutative algebra BE of Hodge endo-
morphisms isomorphic to Q(¢,), as can be seen by noting that

aoe) = 0) ory" _ 0 r(1) rl) _ v(t)
= eae (PE) = eG ete teat = Pech ice (4.43)
for alla € Q, m,n € Z. From this, we see that the natural map
Fe > Ge (4.44)

gives in fact rise to an isomorphism between E™) and Q(¢,). We therefore conclude that the Hodge
structures constructed in this section for the diagonal NV = (2,2) minimal models admit sufficiently

many complex multiplications.

For odd values of k, we have seen above (see eq. (4.19)) that a polarisation can always be con-
structed, implying that the corresponding Hodge structure is of CM type.

4.3. Examples

To make the discussion in this section even more concrete, we work out few examples in detail for
a fixed level k. We start with the k = 3 minimal model for which we construct the Hodge structure
in detail, and show how the Galois action works. This example will also be of central importance
to the discussion of Gepner models in the following section 5. For k = 4 and k = 6 we concentrate
on studying polarisability of the associated Hodge structure, constructing a polarisation explicitly
for these minimal model. Finally, we list a few more examples for low levels k, for which we give
the central data associated to the Hodge structures.

Example: k = 3
Let us investigate the Hodge structure for the k = 3 minimal model explicitly. The complex vector
space Vo defined in eq. (3.7) is given by

Ve = (|r(0))s./rQ)s > Ir(2))s Ir@)is )e » (4.45)

40
with the graded pieces given by

Ir(0))s € Ve", [r(U))se Ver, [r(2))seVer, |r(3))s e Ve" (4.46)
We can pick B = R so that the rational vector space Vo of eq. (3.22) can be written as
Vo = (|Br(0))p > |Bri1y) p > |Br(a)) p > |Br(a))p 20 + (4.47)
With this choice, the intersection matrix is given by
111i
p= {O2ii], (44)
0001
In the rational basis of eq. (4.47) the polarisation is given by
00-1 0
Q\Ba)p |Ba)p) = Que with Q= |) > > (4.49)
01 0 0

Since k + 2 = 5 is prime for k = 3, for every I the field Q(S,,
generated by the fifth root of unity:

1)) is simply the cyclotomic field

QSrw) = Ace) = Qld) - (4.50)
The minimal polynomial of the generator ¢5 is
ltate?to% tat, (4.51)

so the field extension Q(¢;)/Q has degree [Q(¢;) : Q] = 4, and its Galois group is the cyclic group
(Z/5Z)* ~ Z4 ~ Cu, which can be taken to be generated by the field automorphism 62 : G5 + ¢?.

As in eq. (4.35), the R-ground states |r(J)) can be expanded in terms of rational vectors Qn,
which are defined so that

3
= EIQ) € Ve ®e Qs) -
k=0

For instance, the states Qi can be expressed in terms of the boundary states of eq. (4.47) as

120) = ty1Bro))p + th lBr))p »

ai) ~ 10 |Br(0))-p 10 |Bx(2))-p 76 | Br(3)).p > (4.53)
lan”) =~ 15 Br(0))p 0 |Bx(1))p 10 |Br(2))p , .
123°) = §1Bro)p — 15 |Brc)p

Picking now [Qe as the basis vectors, the scaled R-ground states |r(I)).; can be written as

1 ii 1 1
65 es 3 Gf
rO)s = | @ rs =] a}, FA)s=|E]> As = | a], 454)

41
From this we can immediately read off the action of 62 on the vectors |r(/))s:

92 |r(0))s =|rC1))s > PlrQ)s =lr3))s > 2 Ir(2))s=|r(0))s » |r(3))s =|r(2))s -

which agrees with the action (4.34) derived in the previous section. In this way we also see that
the Hodge structure is irreducible, since (cf. eq. (4.37))

Ve = (A(|r(0))s) eile _ we , (4.55)

(0)

and have previously shown that the Hodge substructures corresponding to We are irreducible.

The matrix T(¢;) representing the multiplication by ¢5 in Q(G5) is given, in the basis {1, G5, ¢?, 3}, as

0 1 0 0
0 oO 1 0
0 0 O 1
-1 -1 -1 -1

T(q) = (4.56)

By the previous discussion, T(¢;) represents a Hodge endomorphism en” : Vo + Vo (cf. eq. (4.40)).
A direct computation reveals that it acts on the basis of eq. (4.45) as

Ts) [rs = GlrO)s, Ts) Ir))s = GlrA))s

T(45) Ir(2))5 = Blr(2))s TGs) r(3))s = GIr(3))s ;
which is exactly the result (4.41), and shows that the Hodge type is indeed preserved by the

(4.57)

complexification of this endomorphism. A simple computation also shows that I, T(¢5), T(¢5), and
T(¢s)° are independent over Q, and that the minimal polynomial of T(¢5) is

1+ T(65) +T(G5)? + T(G5)? + T(G)* = 0. (4.58)

These powers of T(¢;) obviously commute with each other, so T(¢;) generates over Q a commutative
subalgebra ET) C Endyag(Ve) of the algebra of Hodge endomorphisms. The Hodge structure
(Vo, Ve) is of CM type as E*() is in fact isomorphic to Q(¢5) with the isomorphism given by

T(gs) > 6. (4.59)

Existence of polarisation fork =4 andk =6

In this section we show that the Hodge structure corresponding to the k = 4 minimal model is
polarisable even though we have seen above that we cannot construct a polarisation in this case from
the twisted Witten index (4.19). However, we can explicitly construct a family of polarisations.

In the case k = 4, the complex vector space Vc and its graded pieces are given by

Ve = (ir) yer? , with = r@)y eve. (4.60)
As before, we can choose B = R so that the rational vector space Vg is given by
1E{0,...4
Vo = (IBrw)p oer , (4.61)
and the intersection matrix is again an upper triangular matrix
1121121
Oo 111i
s=f/oo0111 (4.62)
00011
00001
To construct a polarisation, we find the most general bilinear form Qc on Vc that satisfies the
conditions (3.4)-(3.6). In the basis {|r(0))y;,.--, |r(4)),/}, any such form is associated to a matrix
of the form

0 0 0 0 a
0 0 0 -b 0

Q=1]0 0 ¢« 0 OF, with a,b,c > 0. (4.63)
0 -b 0 0 O

a 0 0 0 0

This gives a polarisation if and only if it arises as a complex bilinear extension of a bilinear form
on Vg. Therefore we check if we can find values for the coefficients a,b,c such that this condition
is satisfied. Consider the change-of-basis matrix from the boundary basis {|B,)) ,---,|Br(4))} to
the normalised basis of R-states {|r(0))-,---,|r(4)),-}, which takes the form

—iG2 -iv3¢h 2 -iV3Ch = — ihe
“V3G -iV3Ch 0 iv3ch  iV3ci2
B=—| v2 0 v2 0 v2 (4.64)
“iV3G  iV3G, 0 -iV3Ch  iV3 Cb
—ig iv3q7 2 iv3¢h = ide
The matrix Q in the basis {|B,(o)) ,---,|Br4))} is thus given by
2a —2\/3b+2c 3a—V3b 2a+2c 2,/3b a— 3b + 2c
3a — 3b 6a — 23d 6a 3a — V3 —2,/3b
B’QB = ; 2a + 2c 6a da + 2c 6a 2a + 2c . (4.65)
—2/3b 3a — V3 6a 6a — 2\/3b 3a — V3b
—a—V3b+2c -2V3b 2a+2c 3a—V3b 2a—2V3b4+2c¢

The corresponding bilinear form Qe restricts to a bilinear form Q on Vg if all entries of the above
matrix are in Q, which is the case if and only if a,c € Q and b € V3Q. Since we are always free to
pick such constants, we have shown that the Hodge structure for the k = 4 model is polarisable.

We could have also argued for the existence of the polarisation by noting that the Hodge structure
of the k = 4 minimal model splits into three Hodge substructures

WE? = (Ow Aves We? = (Dw Be, WE? =(r2))vle, (4.66)
and recalling that these one- and two-dimensional Hodge substructures are always polarisable.
However, the argument presented in this section can be generalised mutatis mutandis for more
complicated Hodge structures, such as those arising from the case k = 6 with the only essential
difference being that the analogous of the matrix (4.65) is valued in a higher-degree field extension
of Q, and to ensure that Qc restricts to a bilinear form on Vg, the entries of Q have to be chosen
to be suitable elements of this extension of Q.

For instance, in the case k = 6, we find that the most general form of Q is given by

0 0 0 0 0 0 2a, sin$ +2a2 cos=
0 0 0 0 0 V2 0

43
with conditions that aj, a2,b,d € Q and that a; and ag are chosen so that

ag <0, ag cot <a, < —ag tan = . (4.67)

Further examples

Further examples can easily be worked out in a manner completely analogous to the two examples
presented above. We take in all cases B = R = {r(0),...,r(k)}, which gives the intersection matrix

5. Example: Gepner Models

Having illustrated the construction of Hodge structures of CM type for NV = 2 minimal models,
we now study Gepner models [48, 49], which are closely related to the minimal models, but admit
geometric realisations as fixed points of non-linear sigma models on Calabi-Yau threefolds. The
first example is the Gepner model which corresponds to the Fermat quintic. This model is built
out of a tensor product of minimal models of odd levels, so it can be verified that it has an algebra
A which satisfies the properties (i)-(iv) set out on page 17. Therefore we can readily apply to proof
of section 3 needing only to check the compatibility condition (3.50).

We include a second Gepner model to illustrate that the construction presented in this paper can
in fact be easily extended further. The second example does not have an algebra satisfying as-
sumption (iv), due to existence of multiple copies of isomorphic representations i € HWRz,(A)
with (c,c) an=an States in the associated Hilbert spaces H,; for every algebra A satisfying the other
assumptions (i)-(iii). In such a case, to construct enough boundary states, the isomorphic rep-
resentations need to be “resolved”, and one need to study boundary states constructed using a
generalised S-matrix [58, 85-87]. However, our construction of section 3 goes through for these
generalised quantities with minimal modifications, as will be demonstrated in section 5.2

5.1. The Gepner model (3, 3, 3,3, 3) corresponding to the Fermat quintic threefold

The first example we consider is the Gepner model corresponding to the conformal fixed point of
the supersymmetric non-linear sigma model on the Fermat quintic threefold. This Gepner model of
total central charge c = 9 is a simple current extension of a tensor product (k = 3) @--- @ (k = 3)
of five copies of A-type NV = 2 minimal models at level k = 3.

The chiral algebra of the tensor product theory contains the product algebra A, x --- x As, where
A; refers to the chiral algebra of the i’th tensor product factor, each isomorphic to eq. (4.1) with
k; = 3. In particular, the chiral algebra contains the fields

5 5
T(z) = VOI@-- @T(2e--@1, Fz) = YO1@---@4(z)@---@1 (5.1)
w=1 i=1

corresponding to the energy-momentum tensor and the U(1)-currents in terms of the energy-
momentum tensors T;(z), the U(1)-currents J;(z), and the identity operators I of the individual
minimal model factors 1 = 1,...,5. Then the conformal weight and the left- and right-moving
U(1)-charges are given by

h=ht+---+hs, qt/R = QyjRits'+4L/R5 - (5.2)

Here hi and qz/p4 are the conformal weights and the U(1)-charges with respect to T;(z) and J;i(z)
fori =1,...,5, respectively. Furthermore, the tensor product theory contains the diagonal spin-3
currents

G#(z) = Sle: eGHs)@--el, (5.3)
i=1

where GF(z), i=1,...,5, are the spin-3 currents of the tensor product factors.

Note, however, that the product algebra A, x---x.As is not the chiral algebra of the tensor product
theory. For instance, we have the simple currents

da,--»,Is,7 © HWR(A] x --- x As) (5.4)

45
explicitly given by

ith pos.
J, = (0,0,2) @ (0,0,0) @ (0,0,0) @ (0,0,2)@(0,0,0), 2€ {2,...,5}, (5.5)
J (0, —2, 0) @ (0, —2, 2) ® (0, —2, 2) @ (0, —2, 2) ® (0,—2, 2) , (5.6)

which belong to the chiral algebra of the tensor product theory but not to the product algebra
A, x---x As. Given these currents, we can consider the simple current extension theory [53, 88, 89],
which is a conformal field theory with the chiral algebra

Amax = (Z,J2,---;Is,F |E€ Ai x--: x As) - (5.7)

As explained in ref. [53], simple current extension amounts to essentially orbifolding the tensor
product theory. The monodromy charges of these simple currents are given by

®7,((li,mi, $1) @-++ ®@ (l5,ms5, 85)) = [Sts | € R/Z, (5.8)

Bz ((Li,my, 61) @ ++ (I5,m5,85)) = [aul(li,mi,s1) ©---@ (ls,m5,85)) +S] € R/Z, (59)

the highest-weight representations of the chiral algebra (5.7) are obtained by restricting to states
in HWR(A, x --- x As) that have vanishing monodromy charges (5.8) and (5.9), and identifying
states which are related by the action of the simple currents (5.5) and (5.6). That is to say

where
in Ri) ~ ...~ Ili) ~ Ti). (5.11)

This simple current construction ensures that the diagonal currents defined in eqs. (5.1) and (5.3)
realise the super-Virasoro algebra SVir of the extended theory of central charge c = 9, which is
well-defined and hence modular invariant [48, 49, 87].

The projection onto fields with integral monodromy charge with respect to the currents 7; amounts
to keeping only fields where all tensor factors are in the R sector, or fields where all tensor factors
are in the NS sector. This projection is often referred to as fermion alignment. The projection
with respect to J ensures that we only have fields with integral U(1) charge in the NS sector, and
onto fields with half-integral U(1) charge in the R sector. This projection is often referred to as
GSO projection.
The full spectrum of the Gepner model corresponding to the Fermat quintic threefold is now
described by the Hilbert space H that is obtained from the diagonal theory of the maximal extended

chiral super-algebra, which is the maximal extended chiral algebra Ajax combined with the spin-3
currents G*+(z) defined in eq. (5.3).

For constructing enough boundary states to satisfy the condition (iv) on p. 2.5, we study the
subalgebra A C Amax, which is given by

A= (,ah,,...,J5|ZLE Ax +++ As) - (5.12)
We consider the highest weight representations of A that are given by

HWR(A) = {i €HWR(A, x --- x As) | Oz, (i) =--- = 0% (8) = [O]}/& , (5.13)

46
where the equivalence relation ~ is defined by

However, not all of these representations appear in the Hilbert space H of the Gepner model, since
by eq. (5.10) such representations have to have vanishing monodromy charge with respect to 7.
Thus we have that the set HWR (A) is given by

HWRy(A) = {i € HWR(A) | ©7(i) =[0]} . (5.15)

To keep the notation compact, we often denote the representations in HWR(A) and the corre-
sponding heighest weight states by®®

(Ijm,s) := (11,1, $1) @---@ (l5,™ms5, 85) , |l,m,s) := |lj,m1,81)@-++@|l5,m5,85) . (5.16)

To make sure that such a label indeed corresponds to a representation in HWRy(A), we have
to take into account the restrictions on the labels 1;,m,;, 5; arising from the condition that the
monodromy charges vanish. It is also useful to keep in mind that the identifications (5.14) imply
that several different values of labels may correspond to the same representation.

The modular S-matrix of the Gepner model with respect to the algebra A is given by [70, 87, 90, 91]

Sams) ims) = 16] ] Scjanss:),(Liis) > (5.17)

i=1

where the S-matrix elements appearing on the right-hand side are those of a k = 3 minimal model,
given explicitly in eq. (4.10). Note that this formula is well-defined: if (I/,m’,s’) = 7‘((1,m,s)) for
some J’ € (Jo,...,J5), then by eq. (2.15)

- e2mi@ 7/((Lms))g

Sqm’,s’),(L.M,8) (.m,s),(L,M,S) = S(,m,s),(L,M3) - (5.18)

To obtain the last equality we have recalled that in constructing the simple current extension
theory, we have restricted to representations (1,m,s) with vanishing monodromy charge for all

To construct the Hodge structure for the quintic Gepner model, we first construct the complex
vector space Vc. To do this, we find the (¢,c),, 4,

-ring which is a purely combinatorial problem.

First, we note that this BPS condition can only be fulfilled if every tensor factor is a (c,c)-state of
a k = 3 minimal model. Then the sought (c,c),, —,,,-Ting states |], m,s) with (1,m,s) €¢ HWR(A)
are obtained from tensor products of minimal model (c,c)-states for which the monodromy charges
(5.8) and (5.9) vanish. The conformal weight and the U(1)-charge for these particular states are

where the labels J; are unambiguous in the equivalence class (1,m,s). The representations in the
set R (see eq. (3.7)) can be obtained by application of the spectral flow operator U/ and are given by

with the corresponding states listed explicitly in table 2. From this table we see that the complex
vector space Vc is 204-dimensional.

sociated to the Gepner model (3,3,3,3,3). The first column gives the state, up to a
permutation of the factors of the tensor product. The second column lists the Hodge
type of the corresponding state, with the third column indicates how many distinct chiral
states can be obtained by the permutations of the tensor factors of the displayed state.

The boundary states take the form

S(L.M.8),(1,m,s)

|Bams)) = > 5
(1m,s)€HWR (A) V7(0,0,0),(Lm.s)

with an overall normalisation constant v chosen to fulfill the Cardy condition [87, 91]. Theses states
are generalised Cardy boundary states in the sense of eq. (2.51). The projected boundary states,
which span the rational vector space Vg, are consequently given by

[l,m,s)) with (L,M,S)¢HWR(A)p, (5.22)

|BuMs))p =p |I,m,s) ay. (5.23)

(unser V (00,0), (1,m,s)

It is now possible to choose the set of representations B C HWR(A)r (see below eq. (3.22) for the

relevant definitions) such that (L;,M;,5;) € HWR(A;)r [70]. Together with the decomposition
indicated in table 2, the pair (Vc, Vo) gives a Hodge structure.

48
Utilising the proof given in section 3.5, this Hodge structure is of CM type if we can show that the
compatibility condition (3.50) is satisfied. To recap, we know that all p € Gal(Q(Sq)/Q) act on
the modular S-matrix as

P(Sa.m,s)(L.M,8)) = €p((1,m, $))So¢(1.m,s))(L,.M,S) > (5.24)

where 9 € Sym(HWRz(A)) is a permutation of representations. To establish the compatibility
condition, we need to show that o((l,m,s)) € R.

Recall that S-matrix entries of the Gepner model are, up to an integral prefactor, given by a product
of k = 3 minimal model S-matrix entries and the elements (1,m,s) € R are tensor products of the
representations r(l;) of minimal models as shown in eq. (5.21). Therefore, from (4.23) it follows
that Q(Sam,s)) © Q(Sr,)) *-* Q(Sru;)) = Q(¢s). To see that equality in fact holds, note that

8,(0)ar(2)@r(3), r(0)or(2)?ar(1)

Oo = (5.25)

Let pa € Gal(Q(Sams))/Q) = Gal(Q(¢5)/Q) be an element corresponding to [a] € (Z/5Z)* as
defined in (4.25). We can use the formula (4.28) for the Galois action on the minimal model
S-matrices to find the action of pq on the S-matrix elements generating Q(Sam,s)):

HWR3(A), we have to show that this representation has a vanishing monodromy charge with

where we have used the formula (5.27) to arrive at the second equality, and the fact that by
definition r(/;) ®---@r(ls) € R has vanishing monodromy charge to obtain the third. This shows
that r(l) @ ++» @r(IS) € HWRy,(A). Since we have argued previously that any such state belong
also to R, this is also sufficient to show that pg maps any r(J1) ®--- @r(l5) € R into an element
of R, and the compatibility condition is satisfied.

As discussed in section 3.3, the Hodge structure is polarised, with the polarisation provided by
the Witten index (3.33). Twisting is not required since the U(1) charges of the states in the

87Naturally the conclusion is independent of the choice of basis. Had we chosen a basis where some of the tensor
factors are in NS-sector, the only significant difference would have been appearance of overall factors of i in the
expressions for the individual minimal model S-matrix elements. We have treated the Galois action in such case
explicitly in appendix C. Using the results of this appendix, it is not difficult to see how the argument could be made
to work with a basis that involves tensor product factors which are in the NS-sector.

49
(c,c) aragn Ting of this theory are integral. Therefore the Hodge structure we have constructed is
of CM type with the CM-field Q(¢;). To be specific, the Hodge structure splits into 51 irreducible
Hodge substructures of dimension four, and the Hodge endomorphism algebra of each irreducible
piece is isomorphic to Q(¢5).

This Gepner model corresponds to the conformal fixed point of the NV = (2,2) non-linear sigma
model on the Fermat quintic threefold [48, 77-79, 92]

5

Thus we have obtained a physics-based derivation of the known result that the Fermat quintic
admits complex multiplication, with the CM-field Q(¢5) (see, for example, ref. [93]).

5.2. The Gepner model (6, 6, 2, 2,2) corresponding to a threefold P4 122,218]

As the second example, we consider the Gepner model (6,6,2,2,2) given by a simple current
extension of the tensor product (ki = 6) @ (ko = 6) @ (kz = 2) @ (k, = 2) @ (ks = 2) of A-type
N = 2 minimal models with the indicated levels k;. As discussed in the beginning of the section,
this case does not strictly fit into the general framework we have set out in sections 2 and 3. Rather
than providing a detailed example of our construction, the purpose of this section is to substantiate
our claim that further generalisations of the constructions presented in this paper are possible.
Consequently, we will be rather brief about the conformal field theory constructions underlying
this case, contenting ourselves with presenting the bare necessities required to understand the
construction of Hodge structures and Galois actions. We refer the interested reader to refs. [53,
58, 85-87] for further details on the conformal field theory aspects of the Gepner model presented
in this section.

The simple current extension is again taken with respect to the currents

However, as in the previous section, we find it useful to organise the fields of the simple current
extension theory in terms of representations of a subalgebra

A = (AL x+++ x As, Pays) CA. (5.35)

The distinct highest-weight representations of A which appear in the simple current extended theory
are given by

HWRy(A) = {i € HWR(A] x «++ x As) | On (i) = + = Oz, (i) = O7(H) = [O]}/~ , (5.36)

where the equivalence relation ~ is now
ix Sli) ~ 1. & Ili) - (5.37)
We denote the highest-weight representations in HWRy(A) by®®
(I,m,s) == (1,11, 81) ®--- ® (Is, m5, 85) « (5.38)
In contrast to the previous example, the simple current
L = JI*Jr = (0,8,2) @ (0,8, 2) ® (0, 0,0)  (0,0,0) ® (0,0,0) € (Ja,.--,.I5,T) (5.39)

acts trivially on exactly those representations (11,771, $1) ®---@ (l5,ms5, $5) € HWRy(A1 x--- x As)
for which 1, = lz = 3, that is to say

L((3, m1, $1) ® (3, ma, 82) ® (13, mg, $3) @ +++ @ (15,5, 85))
= (3, m1, 81) ® (3, ma, 82) @ (Iz, M3, $3) @ ++ @ (15,5, 85). (5.40)

It is not difficult to see that in the present case, £ is the only simple current which acts trivially
on some representations.

As discussed in ref. [53], the existence of the current £ with such fixed representations implies that to
construct a modular invariant partition function, we must include the corresponding representations
of A (that is, the equivalence classes of such representations under ~ of eq. (5.37)) with multiplicity
in the Hilbert space H of the theory. The multiplicity of the Hibert space Hams), (1,m,s) €
HWR(A) is given by the order of the stabiliser group

Stab4((I,m,s)) := {Z € (%,..-,56,T) | Z(i) =} , (5.41)

where i € HWR(A, x--- x As) is any representative of the equivalence class (1, m,s) € HWRy(A).
For the model (6, 6, 2, 2,2) the only stabiliser groups that appear are cyclic, being the trivial group
1 or Zo, generated by CL.

Following refs. [85, 86], we find it useful to distinguish different copies of isomorphic represen-
tations by labeling each with a character ~ € Stab,4((1,m,s))*, that is a group homomorphism
w : Stab4((1,m,s)) — C*. Since the only non-trivial stabiliser groups that appear are isomorphic
to Z/2Z, so the only charachters we need to consider are the trivial character we denote by 17,
and the character 1~, defined by the relation 17(£) = —1.

We denote the representations and the corresponding highest-weight states by
(l,m,s)y := ((1,m1, 51) ®@--- @ (Is, m5, 85), W) , |(l,m,s)y) . (5.42)

The set R is again defined as the set of representations decorated by characters related by spectral
flow to elements of the (c,c)g,=q,-ring. As in the quintic case, it turns out that these states are
given by tensor products of the minimal model representations r(J;) € HWR(A;) defined in eq. (4.6),
decorated by characters.

We normalise the corresponding R-ground states so that they are orthonormal, i.e.

wid, m, s) ul’, m’, 8))6)y = dye Sim,s),(',m’,s’) : (5.43)

°8 As explained in footnote 36, the labels 1, m, s are not unique for a given state.
Boundary states and the generalised S-matrix

In the present case, we have representations (1,m,s) z+, (1,m,s);—- € R which differ only by the
character w € Stab.4((1,m,s))*. For instance the representations

(r(3) @ r(3) @r(1) @r(0) @r(0))4+ , (r(3) @r(3) @r(1) @r(0) @r(0));- ER (5.44)

have this property, and are thus isomorphic as representations of A. Since the modular S-matrix
has only one entry for each isomorphic representation of A, we cannot construct enough boundary
states to obtain an intersection matrix © of rank equal to the number of (c,c)q, <q, primary states.
Therefore this case does not satisfy the assumption (iv) on page 17.

However, it is possible to proceed with only minor modifications, as we can obtain an intersection
matrix of high enough rank, which is enables us to construct the rational vector space Vg as
in section 3.3, if we consider a generalised S-matrix Sims}y,(,ms),, [85, 86]. The first index
corresponds to boundary labels {L,M,S}w, where

wy

{L,M,8} € HWRy(Al x +--+ x As)/~ and W € Stab4({L,M,$})* , (5.45)

where ~ denotes the equivalence relation (5.34), and the stabiliser of {L, M, $} is defined completely
analogously to eq. (5.41). Note that in contrast to the set HWR,(A), there is no restriction to
representations with vanishing monodromy charge.

In the present case, the generalised S-matrix reads

With this matrix, it turns out that we can apply the construction of section 3 mutatis mutandis:
The boundary states are labeled by the boundary labels {L,M,$} defined in eq. (5.45), and are
given by

S m,s
Bas) = D> —etseGmey |(m,s)y)) - (5.47)

Here |(1,m,s),,)) are the generalised Ishibashi states (85, 86] which are labeled by the representations
(1,m,s)y € HWRy(A), and which are normalised such that

w((,m,s)y|(',m’,s’)s)) = [Stab.4((1,m,s))| dud dam,s),(/m’s") « (5.48)
The projected boundary states take the form which is similar to eq. (3.21), albeit not completely
analogous, due to the different normalisation (5.48) of Ishibashi states here:

We can choose a set B of boundary labels {L,M, S$} such that (Li, Mi, S;) € HWR(Ai)r. For this
choice of B, the intersection matrix

Dap = p(Bale’™” |Ba)p , A,BeEB. (5.50)

is of maximal rank, valued in Q, and antisymmetric. This also allows us to take the rational vector
space Vg to be defined by the span of the projected boundary states (5.49). The conveniently
normalised states of eq. (3.42) now take the form

where, compared to the definition (3.42), we have taken into account the different normalisation of
the Ishibashi states. However, the last expression is completely analogous to eq. (3.42). It is this
latter relation that is the key to proving the CM property in section 3.5.

These relations imply that, for the construction of CM-type Hodge structures presented in sec-
tions 3.3 and 3.5, we can use the projected generalised boundary states to define the rational vector
space Vg, with the graded spaces veo constructed from the states |(1,m,s),) with (1,m,s)y € R
as before.

Galois action on the generalised S-matria

Since we are using the generalised S-matrix, the proof of refs. [60, 61] of existence of Galois symmetry
and the properties of the Galois action on the S-matrix, reviewed in section 2.3, does not apply
directly. However, we can check the requisite properties directly by using the explicit formula (5.46)
for the generalised S-matrix. From this formula it is manifest that the S-matrix elements are
algebraic numbers, lying in a field generated by roots of unity, so they generate a cyclotomic field
extension Q(S) = Q(¢32), and hence there is an action of an Abelian Galois group Gal(Q(S)/Q) ~
(Z/32Z)* on the generalised S-matrix.

It is not difficult, although somewhat tedious, to show that this Galois action satisfies
o(SiiMs}y,(.ms),) = €o((1,m,s)u) Saims}v.c((kms),) With €o((1,m,s)y) € {-1, +1}, (5.52)

for all o € Gal(Q(S)/Q) and all representations (1,m,s)y € HWRy(A). Here ¢ is a permutation
of all such representations, which is independent of the boundary label {L,M,S}w.

To see this, we note at first that when the representation (1,m,s), € HWRy(A) has a trivial
stabiliser Stab_4((1,m,s)), the generalised S-matrix of eq. (5.46) reduces to a product of S-matrices
of minimal models:
: (2)
a
Sams}etimsyy = 128] T8e,.10,5),Qsmis) (5.53)
i=1

Therefore, under the action of og € Gal(Q(S)/Q) corresponding to [a] € (Z/32Z)*, the generalised
S-matrix transforms as

5 5
Ca (Simsyw.imse) = (11 cg (tomsd) 128 T1812. arasy,ctumins) * (5.54)
i=1 i=1
where oi) =| as) is the restriction of 4 to the number field Q(S) generated by the modular
S-matrix elements of the i’th minimal model factor. Here l/, m/, si are the unique integers such that
O<U<k, i; = a(l; +1)—1 mod kj+2,
—ki-1< mi < kj+2, m, = am; mod 2(k;+2) , (5.55)
-1l<si<2, si = as; mod4.

To derive these, one can use arguments similar to those used in section 4.2. See also the discussion
around eq. (C.8) for the exact arguments that can be used to derive these formulae.

Now we only have to check that the right-hand side of eq. (5.54) is, up to sign, an element of the
generalised S-matrix of the form S¢z1,8}y,(",m’s’),, for a representation (I',m’,s’)y €¢ HWRy(A).
For this, it is sufficient to show that

a((Im,s)) = (I,m,s1) @--- (Ih, mb, 6) € HWRy (AL x --- x As) (5.56)

is a representation with vanishing monodromy chagres under J; and 7, and that this representation
does not have a non-trivial stabiliser.

To check the vanishing of the monodromy charge under 7, we note that from the above formu-

lae (5.55), it follows that si = asi + 4nj for some nj € Z. Thus we have that

s, st

© 7,(sa((I,m,s))) E + | [a(S +=) + 2(mi 4 ni)| [o] € R/Z, (5.57)

where we have used © 7,((1,m,s)) = [$+] = [0]. The proof that ©7(<sa((1,m,s))) = [0] is
completely analogous.

To see that the representation <q((1,m,s)) does not have a non-trivial stabiliser, that is, [| 4 3 or
5 # 3, it suffices to note that
a(3+1)-1 = 3 mod8 (5.58)

for alla € (Z/32Z)*. Therefore the representations with non-trivial stabilisers get mapped to other
such representations, which also implies that representations with trivial stabilisers are mapped to
other representations with trivial stabilisers under the Galois action.

Thus we have that

Oa (Samsyv..ms)o) = €o.((1,m,$)y)SL.M.S}y.lm's"}y > (5.59)
with the overall sign given by

€c,((1,m,s)y) = I< co (Cli, mi, 81) . (5.60)

i

In the case where the stabiliser of (1,m,s) is non-trivial, that is l; = lg = 3, the expression for
the generalised S-matrix consists of two terms, the first of which again a product of the modular
S-matrices of minimal models, and the second one is given by

ic}

—80(L (c) [Jen mi M;/8—s;S;/2) Il Baas er (5.61)
i=l 1=3

The transformation behaviour of the product of S-matrices of minimal models can be found using
the same arguments as above, which show that

sa((1,m,s)) = (Uj,m{,s) @--- @ (Ih, mt, s§) € HWRy(A1 x +++ x As) , (5.62)

where li, mi, and s/ are still given by eq. (5.55), and the overall sign €,,((1,m,s),) is also given
by eq. (5.60). We have also shown above that this transformation maps representations with non-
trivial stabilisers to other such representations. Under the action of oq € Gal(Q(S)/Q), the second
term (5.62) transforms to

5

2 5
[e.g (Gis mi, si)) (-sw cence [Temsne*5™ TTS, Si),(U sm! 0) , (5.63)

1=3 i=1 1=3

so all we have to do to establish the formula (5.59) for the transformation of the generalised S-matrix
in the case of representations with non-trivial stabilisers, we have to show that

Ie

€,0 ((3, ma, 8%)) =f. (5.64)

i=l

This follows straightforwardly by using the form (4.10) of the S-matrix of minimal model, from
which we see that for k = 6, that is 1 = 1,2, and / = 3, the matrix elements vanish for L odd, and
the condition becomes empty. For L even the expression reduces to

g(t _& ye °

(3,m,s),(L,M,S) — Gitttae in for i=1,2, (5.65)

from which we can read € (((3,m,s)) = 1, which implies that the condition (5.64) is satisfied.
This finishes the proof of the Galois transformation property (5.52) of the generalised S-matrix.

Compatibility condition

Given the above observations, the proof given in section 3.5 still works mutatis mutandis, implying
that the Hodge structure (Vg, Vc), the construction of which was explained in the previous subsec-
tion, is of CM type provided the obvious analogue of the compatibility condition (3.50) is satisfied.
That is to say, if for all (1,m,s)y € R, we define

QSams)e) = O({Seramsyo.tims)s | (LM, S}v € B}) , (5.66)
the compatibility condition is the statement that every p € Gal(Q(S(m,s),,)/Q) acts on the S-matrix
so that

PSmms}y.(lms),) = ((,m,8)y)Sin_s}y.o(lms),) > forall  {L,M,S}y¢B, (5.67)

where €,((1,m,s)y) € {+1} is a sign dependent only on the choice of p and on the representation
(1,m,s)y, and 9 € Sym(R) so that o((1,m,s)y) € R.

We will finish this section by showing that this condition is satisfied. The proof proceeds largely
along the same lines as for the quintic, with the only essential difference being that the expression
(5.46) does not quite reduce to a product of minimal model S-matrix elements, so we need to
analyse the action of the Galois group on the additional character-dependent term separately.

Depending on the representation (1,m,s)y € R, the field extension Q(Sq.m,s),,) defined in eq. (5.66)
is either Q(¢g) or Q(i):

Qi) if  € {1,5} or ky € {1,5} or h=h =3,
Q(Sam,s),,) = (5.68)
Q(¢s) otherwise .

The corresponding Galois groups Gal(Q(S(1,m,s),,)/Q) are isomorphic to Zz and Zz x Zz, respectively.

7
It is most convenient to study the action of the Galois group on the representations (1,m,s),, € R

separately in the two cases. We study the second case first.

In this case the Galois group Gal(Q(¢g)/Q) & Ze x Zo is generated by two elements p3 and ps that
act as

pss) = CG, ps(Q@e) = (5.69)

On Q(i) C Q(¢g), where the S-matrix elements of the last three minimal model factors are valued,
these restrict to 43 € Gal(Q(i)/Q) and 6; € Gal(Q(i)/Q), respectively, which map

@3() = -i, (i) =i. (5.70)

Since this case does not include the representations (1, m,s) with 1; = lz = 3, which is the condition
to have a non-trivial stabiliser, the relevant generalised S-matrix elements are simply products of
minimal model S-matrix elements. Therefore we can immediately deduce the action of the above
two generators on the representations (r(/,) ®---@r(Js))y € R. For instance, for p3, we have that

i=l i=3 (5.71)

= SIM shu (r(i)@-arl)e >

p3 (Samtsyw.(e(t)0--or(s))»)

where l! are the unique integers such that

0<U<6 and Ui = 3(; +1)—-1 mod8, for i=1,2,

/ Ps —— (5.72)
0<1,<2 and U,=3(;+1)—1 mod4, for 4=3,4,5.

A

he same argument, applied for p5 shows that it maps the representations (r(/1)®- --@r(/s))y € Ras
os((r(1) ®--- @r(ls))y) = (r(4) @ r(y) ® r(lg) @ rls) @r(ls))u , (5.73)

where /! are again unique integers determined by

0<U<6 and U=5(l;+1)—1 mod8. (5.74)
Case 1: Q(Sa.m.s),,) = Q(t)
In the first case, the Galois group Gal(Q(i)/Q) ~ Z» is generated by a single element 3, which
maps

psi) = —i. (5.75)

If either of the stabiliser groups Stab 4(r(l1)@---@r(Is)), r(l1)@---@r(Ils) € R, or Stab({L, M, S}),
{L,M,S} ¢€ B, is trivial, then the generalised S-matrix (5.46) reduces to a product of minimal
model S-matrices, and using an argument identical to that employed in the first case, we find that
p3 € Gal(Q(i)/Q) acts on the representations (r(I1) ®--- @r(I5))y € R as

es((r(i) ®--- @r(ls))y) = (r(h) @ r(o) ® (Us) @ r(U4) @r(l5))w , (5.76)
where // are the unique integers determined by
0<U<6 and Ui = 3(j; +1)—-1 mod8, for a= 1,2 ;

0<U<2 and . = 3(;+1)-1 mod4, for 4 = 8455 »

a

(5.77)

If both of the aforementioned stabiliser groups are non-trivial, then there is an additional term

2

—8U(L)y(L) [J emer) TIS LiMi,Si)s(lismi.si) ? B08)
i=1 i=3

which is not a product of minimal model S-matrices. Note that the only representations in R
with non-trivial stabilisers are of the form (r(3) ® r(3) @ r(l3) ® r(l4) ® r(Is))y, and therefore
have m,; = mg = —4. The fact that the boundary label has a non-trivial stabiliser implies that
L, = Ly = 3. Since we have chosen the set of boundary labels B such that (L;, M;,S;) € HWR(Aj)r,
we have that $; and S2 are odd, which in turn implies that M; and Mp are even. Hence, the
additional term takes the form

2
—8U(L (4) ]J-1 Oe PTT Ais koma (5.79)

i=1
Thus under the action of ps, this term transforms to
5 2 5
[os (r@)) (-sHeweo [TTT snetaman) (5.80)
i=1 i=] i=3

where we have used that €p,(r(3))? = 1. Therefore the additional term (5.78) transforms in the
same way as the product of minimal model $-matrices, so that the corresponding transformation
on the representations is

o3((r(3) @ r(3) @ r(ls) @ r(la) @r(ls))yu) = (e(3) @r(3) @ r(y) @ ry) @ r(l5))u 5 (5.81)

and the overall sign is given by the product TT. €p3(r(;)). Thus we have shown that the compat-
ibility condition is satisfied in all cases.

This is enough to show that the proof given in section 3.5 can be used to show that the Hodge
structure (Vg, Vc) admits sufficiently many complex multiplications. Since the intersection matrix
¥ given in eq. (5.50) is antisymmetric, it can be shown that this Hodge structure is indeed polaris-
able, and hence the Hodge structure is in fact of CM type. To be slightly more detailed, the proof
wy

of section 3.5 implies that the Hodge structure splits into 27 Hodge substructures ws ms) cor-
responding to representations (1,m,s)y € R with Q(Sqms),,) = Q(¢s) with Hodge endomorphism

algebra is isomorphic to Q(¢g), and 33 Hodge substructures corresponding to representations with
Q(Sam,s),,) = Q(i), with Hodge endomorphism algebra isomorphic to Q(i).

This Gepner model corresponds to the degree eight hypersurface [48, 77-79, 92]

Therefore, the results of this section, can be viewed as a physics proof that this geometry admits
complex multiplication.
6. Summary and Discussion

In these concluding remarks we summarise our results and offer some outlook about broadening
the scope of our analysis in section 6.1. As our findings and the existing literature on the topic
indicate a more general relationship between two-dimensional conformal field theories and arith-
metic geometry, we contemplate about a motivic perspective on conformal field theories in general
in section 6.2, which we anticipate to further investigate in the future.

6.1. Summary and outlook

In this paper, we have provided a construction that associates to a unitary N = (2,2) supersym-
metric conformal field theory a corresponding Hodge structure. We have also shown that the notion
of Galois symmetry [60, 61] of rational conformal field theories is intimately linked to these Hodge
structures being of CM type.

One of our main motivations for introducing this construction is that it allows us to study the
conjectured equivalence between rational conformal field theories and complex multiplication [16

18, 94, 95] as a purely conformal field theoretic question. To this end, in section 3.4, we used
the Galois symmetry to show that the rational Hodge structures we define have always sufficiently
many complex multiplications, subject to a technical assumption that the action of the relevant
Galois group closes on the (¢,¢),, —,,-ring, in the sense explained in eq. (3.50). Thus these Hodge
structures are also of CM type if they are polarised. We show that in many cases a polarisation
for this Hodge structure can be obtained from a twisted Witten index defined in eq. (3.31). Such
cases include in particular theories with integral U(1)-charges, and thus the theories with a known
geometric interpretation. It turns out that the polarisation also exists even in many cases where it
is not provided by the twisted Witten index.

In section 3.2, we show that any unitary NV = (2,2) supersymmetric conformal field theory with
a finite (c,c)-ring has an associated real Hodge structure. The key idea of the construction is
that the U(1)-charges of the states in the (c,c) qn=qn Ting can be identified with the grading of the
Hodge structure. The real structure is given by the complex conjugation map whose action on the
conformal field theory states is given by application of the charge conjugation operator. The real
Hodge structure can be refined to give a rational Hodge structure if there are enough boundary
states in the boundary conformal field theory. Then, as shown in section 3.3, one can define a
rational vector space by taking the Q-linear combinations of the boundary states. It is shown that
this is compatible with the real structure, meaning that the complex conjugation map introduced
in section 3.2 keeps the boundary states fixed.

While one of the main utilities of this construction of Hodge structures is that their definition does
not require a description of the conformal field theory as arising from a non-linear sigma model on
a target Calabi-Yau geometry, the construction of the Hodge structure is such that in this setting
it reproduces the geometric Hodge structure, as shown in section 3.6.

We exemplify the general construction by presenting three different (families of) theories for which
we can construct CM-type Hodge structures: V = 2 minimal models, the Gepner model (5,5, 5,5, 5)
corresponding to the quintic threefold, and the Gepner model (6,6, 2,2, 2), which corresponds to
the Calabi~Yau manifold given as the hypersurface in the projective space P} 1,2,2,2 [8].°° For these
models, we use known expressions for the boundary states to construct the rational Hodge structure.
Then, by using the explicit form of the S-matrices of these theories, we are able to find the relevant
Galois groups, verify that their actions on the S-matrices satisfy the compatibility condition (3.50),

*°Strictly speaking, the general construction of section 3 does not apply for the last example as to obtain enough
boundary states, we have to use the ‘generalised S-matrix’ of eq. (5.46). However, as we show in section 5.2, the
arguments presented in section 3 remain valid mutatis mutandis.
which is enough to show that the Hodge structures are of CM type.

Since the construction presented in this paper can also be applied to models which do not have a
geometric sigma model interpretation, such as minimal models, it is an interesting question whether
the original conjecture of ref. [16] can be extended to cover these non-geometric rational conformal
field theories. For instance, we have shown that all MW = 2 minimal models have a corresponding
Hodge structure with sufficiently many complex multiplications. We have seen the twisted Witten
index (3.31) gives rise to polarisation for all minimal models of odd level. Additionally, we have
examined several examples of minimal models of even level, and found a polarisation for each of
these examples. This raises the question whether all MV = (2,2) rational conformal field theories
have associated A- and B-type Hodge structures which are of CM type and compatible in an
appropriate sense.1°

Due to the fact that the construction presented is purely conformal field theoretic, we can only probe
one direction of the conjectured equivalence between the conformal field theories and geometries
with complex multiplication. If we were able to show that the condition of eq. (3.50) was satisfied
for all N = (2,2) rational conformal field theories, we would have shown that every such theory
has an associated Hodge structure with sufficiently many complex multiplications. However, the
claim that every geometry with complex multiplication has a corresponding rational conformal field
heory would still remain elusive.

While not sufficient for a proof, the connection of rationality to Galois symmetry might give some
rough heuristics on the question of existence of the conjectured equivalence. Namely, the decom-
position of the spectrum into finitely many irreducible representations under A was the crucial
ingredient in showing that the S-matrix elements are algebraic numbers and thus define a Galois
extension. If the theory has infinitely many representation, the characteristic polynomials (2.16) of
he fusion matrices would be of infinite degree, and therefore allowing for existence of transcendental
S-matrix elements.

To substantiate the relationship among rationality of conformal field theories, Galois symmetries of
he Verma modules of the chiral algebras of conformal field theories, and CM type Hodge structures
associated to conformal field theories, further studies of rational two-dimensional rational conformal
field theories are important. The theories discussed here are based on two-dimensional NV = (2, 2)
supersymmetric rational conformal field theories that obey the assumptions spelt out on page 17.

Firstly, these assumptions are possibly not all independent in the sense that starting from a more
axiomatic definition of two-dimensional conformal field theories, some of the made assumptions
may follow from a suitable axiomatic approach. Secondly, it would be relevant to see, which of
these assumptions can be relaxed, while Hodge structures of CM type still indicate rationality of
the underlying conformal field theory. By presenting a Gepner model that does not obey the last
assumption in section 5.2, we have exemplified that a more general framework for Hodge structures
of CM type can be formulated.

In order to identity the essence of arithmetic properties of rational conformal field theories, it is
important to systematically examine broader classes of rational two-dimensional conformal field
theories. In this context it would be worthwhile to study rational conformal field theories based
on Kazama-Suzuki models [96], asymmetric orbifolds of rational conformal field theories [97], and
rational realizations of conformal field theories based on the Shatashvili-Vafa construction [98, 99}.
Moreover, in this work supersymmetry plays an important to define Hodge structures for two-
dimensional conformal field theories. Therefore, it would be interesting to examine what arithmetic

‘Tt has been pointed out for instance in refs. [17, 18, 94, 95] that there is a subtlety in the conjectured equivalence
between rationality and complex multiplication [16] in the sense that one must be careful in stating which Hodge
structures have to be of CM type to obtain an equivalence.

60
data can still be defined for rational two-dimensional conformal field theories in the absence of
supersymmetry.

6.2. Conformal field theory, complex multiplication, and arithmetic

Complex multiplication is also intrinsically related to arithmetic geometry whose relation to physics
has seen recent increase in interest. For instance, arithmetic geometry has been studied in connec-
tion to BPS black hole solutions and D-branes (e.g. refs. [100, 101]), flux vacua (e.g. refs. [36
39]), and most importantly for this work, conformal field theories and complex multiplication
[18, 94, 102-105]. Indeed, some connections between conformal field theories and arithmetic ge-
ometry have been drawn in these works. In the remaining of this section, we aim to very briefly
explain some central results and ideas of these works, and speculate on possible connections to the
construction of Hodge structures presented in this paper. The topics covered in this section are
very wide and intricate, so we will necessarily be very sketchy, aiming only to provide the reader
with a rough overview of some important ideas. For more discussion of the relevant concepts of
arithmetic geometry, aimed at physicists, see for example refs. [36, 40, 100].

Studying spaces as sets of solutions of polynomial equations over finite fields, such as F, ~ Z/pZ
integers modulo a prime p, is a central aspect of arithmetic geometry. For instance, a basic question
in arithmetic geometry could be, how many points does an elliptic curve defined over Q, i.e. defined
by polynomials with rational coefficients, have over F,. That is, how many tuples (X : Y : Z), up
to projective equivalence, satisfy the congruence

ZY? — (X34 AZ?X+BZ?) =0 modp. (6.1)

For any non-singular projective variety X, point counts #X(Fpn) over finite fields Fy» with p”
elements can be collected into a generating function, called the Hasse-Weil zeta function, defined
by

¢(X;T) := exp (> tpi") : (6.2)

n=1

The utility of this function is that it satisfies some useful and intriguing properties which were set
out as so-called Weil conjectures [106], by now proven {107-110}. For instance, as a function of T,
Gp(X;T) is a rational function of T, taking the form

PLY (T) PP (7)

AST) =
GO = Pay PEM)

(6.3)

where the degrees of the polynomials are given by the Betti numbers of X, degy POT) = bi(X),
and the roots Ajj of POT) are complex numbers with absolute value |)j,;| = p'/?.

It is a remarkable fact that the polynomials P;(T) can be seen as arising from a representation of the
absolute Galois group Gal(Q/Q) acting on certain cohomology groups H'(X) of the manifold X.
According to modularity theorems and conjectures, such representations correspond to automorphic
representations, which, in simplest terms, implies that we can use the polynomials PO(T) to define
a corresponding L-function, which

L(X;s) = J] (Pe) ~ . (6.4)

p prime

where the polynomials PO (ps) are exactly those appearing in the zeta function (6.3), except
possibly for a finite number of ‘bad’ primes. One can also define L-functions for various modular

61
forms. Then various modularity conjectures and theorems relate the L-functions of the variety X
to L-functions of modular forms.

Consider again the special case of elliptic curves FE defined over Q. For these, the zeta function
takes the form

1 — dpT + pT?
ET) = ._*  * _., 6.5
GBT) = Goa FA (6.5)
and the L-function of F is given by (up to factors corresponding to ‘bad’ primes)
L(E,s) = Il (1—app~* + p!-*s) . (6.6)
p prime
For an ordinary modular form
22 i
f@ = Yad, (6.7)
i=0
the L-function can be defined, up to factors corresponding to bad primes, as
L(f,s) = Il (1 — cpp? + p87} (6.8)

p prime

and the modularity theorem for elliptic curves defined by polynomials with coefficients in Q states
that for every such elliptic curve E, there exists a weight-2 modular form f so that

L(E,s) = L(f,s). (6.9)

In the case of elliptic curves, complex multiplication has an interpretation as a ‘symmetry’ of the
curve, so it stands to reason that there is a corresponding ‘symmetry’ property of the modular
form. In this case it is the existence of a self-twist of the corresponding modular form f, which
means that for all but possibly ‘bad’ primes cp = x(p)cp, where x(p) is the Kronecker character
of imaginary quadratic field, taking values +1. In particular, this implies that a, = 0 for all p for
which x(p) = —1, so half of the coefficients a, vanish.

The above is a first indication that complex multiplication is intrinsically linked to arithmetic
geometry. Indeed, Deuring’s theorem (see e.g. ref. [111]) shows that the L-functions of elliptic
curves with Hodge structure of CM-type can be expressed in terms of L-functions of (algebraic)
Hecke characters. Given a number field K, its ring of integers Ox and an ideal m C Ox the Hecke
character x of modulus m can be thought of as functions from the set of ideals of Ox to C which
satisfy properties analogous to those of the familiar Dirichlet characters. Namely, we require that
x(Ox) = 1, and that for any ideals a,b C Ox, x(ab) = x(a)x(b) and x(a) 4 0 only if (a,m) = 1.
In addition, y is subject to a few technical conditions which we will not attempt to describe here.

The L-function of a Hecke character y also be defined in terms of Euler factors:

Ly(s) = T] G@-x@)Np))™ (6.10)
pCOK
prime

where N(p) := |Ox/p| denotes the ideal norm. A special case of Deuring’s theorem states that for
an elliptic curve E/Q with complex multiplication, there exists a Hecke character y such that

62
For instance, let us consider the elliptic curve with the LMFDB [112] label 576.i1:

yy = 2-32, (6.12)
which has a Hodge structure of complex multiplication type, with the corresponding CM-field
being Q(i), which has the ring of integers Z/i].

Given a prime ideal p C Z/i], let 7 denote its unique primary generator, that is, an element 7 such
that p = (7) and 7 = 1 mod 2 + 2i. For each such primary generator, we define the 4th power
residue symbol (2), as the unique 4th root of unity satisfying

(<) = aNP-D/4 mod x (6.13)
mw)
if 7 { a. Otherwise we define (2), = 0. One can show that with these definitions
3
x(pP) = [—] 7m (6.14)
T/4

defines a Hecke character. Furthermore it can be shown that this character satisfies eq. (6.11).4

To get an idea how the relation given by Deuring’s theorem works, consider, for instance p = 5,
which splits in Z[i] into 5 = (1 + 2i)(1 — 2i), the numerator of the zeta function is given by

PQ) (p-*) = 1- 4p + pl = (1 — (2-i)p™*)(1— (2+i)p*)

_ _ (6.16)
= (1+ x((1 + 2i))N((1 + 2i))*) (1+ x((1 — 21) N((1— 21))~*)_,
For p = 7, which is inert in Z{i], the Euler factor is given by
PH) = 1+ ph = 1+ X(N) (6.17)

in accordance with the fact that half of the coefficients a, vanish. Every Euler factor behaves as
one of the examples above, depending on whether the corresponding prime is split or inert in Z[i].

These observations are believed to readily generalise to higher-dimensional Calabi-Yau varieties
with complex multiplication. This can be tested, for instance, for the one-parameter family of
mirror quintic threefolds, which are given by 2B quotients of

where w is the complex structure parameter. In particular, at ~ = 0 this gives the mirror quintic
threefold. We have seen in section 5.1 that the Fermat quintic has a Hodge structure of CM type,
and by studying how taking the quotient affects the Hodge structure (or by using B-type Hodge
structures), it is not difficult to show that the mirror Fermat quintic has also a 4-dimensional Hodge
structure which is of CM type with the CM-field Q(¢;) with its ring of integers given by Z[¢5].

From the Weil conjectures, it follows that the zeta function of a one-parameter Calabi-Yau threefold

X is of the form

1 - Rp(T)
OST) = Goa 0— PTF)’ ee

41To see this, one can, for instance, derive the following result using Jacobi sums:

0 ifp=3 mod4, (6.15)
ap = $= ~
'p (3)," fy (2),7 otherwise ,

where R,(T) is a degree-4 polynomial. For the first few primes, the zeta functions of the family
of mirror quintic threefolds were computed in refs. [113, 114]. It was found that for the mirror
Fermat quintic, analogously to the elliptic curve case, the form of the polynomial R,(T) depends
on how the rational prime p factorises in Z[¢5]: Let p denote the residue degree least integer such
that p? = 1 mod 5, so that p is the residue degree of any prime divisor in Z[¢5] of p. Then, for
p even,

R,(L) = (1— preyt/e , (6.20)

whereas for p = 1, the polynomial R,(T’) takes the form

R,(f) 1+a,T +4 bppT? + app ’T? + p°T4 (1+ y4pT + p°T?)(1+y_pT + p®T?) , (6.21)

where ap,b, € Z, and 74 € Z[V5]. Further, as expected, over the ring of integers Z[¢5], the
polynomial factorises into linear factors. In fact, the polynomials R,(T) computed in ref. [114]
correspond exactly to the Euler factors of a Hecke character, see also for related work refs. {115, 116].

Given the relevance of arithmetic geometry to complex multiplication, and the fact that the relevant
arithmetic data can be found by considering a Galois action on certain cohomology groups, it is
natural to ask whether conformal field theory data can be used to find this Galois action. In this
work, we have essentially constructed the singular cohomology using the boundary states, and the
de Rham cohomology by using the states in the (c, c)g,=qp-ring. These are two of the three ‘classical’
realisations of a motive, roughly speaking an algebraically defined piece of cohomology. The third
realisation, which encodes the arithmetic data is the étale cohomology (see for example ref. [36] for
a brief physicist-oriented review). It is an interesting question whether étale cohomology, or another
arithmetically interesting cohomology theory,*? could also be constructed from the conformal field
theory data.

While existence of a natural construction of this type may seem unlikely, there are concrete indica-
tions that the conformal field theory might encode arithmetic data. For instance, in ref. [103], the
coefficients ap of elliptic curves with corresponding Gepner models was computed using conformal
field theory data, so-called string functions. In refs. [104, 105] this data is obtained for elliptic
curves of complex multiplication type by considering traces of conformal field theory operators
over subspaces of the Hilbert space of states of the theory. It would be interesting to see if there
constructions can be generalised and systematised to a larger class of conformal field theories.

“Tn practice, it may be easier to construct a cohomology theory that admits a more explicit description, such as
the Monsky-Washnitzer cohomology (see e.g. ref. [117]).

A. Definitions of CM-type Hodge structures

Since there exist several equivalent definitions for Hodge structures of CM type in the literature,
we briefly review some other common useful definitions in this appendix, and discuss their relation
to the definition given in section 3.4, which we use in the main body of the paper. We keep the
discussion very brief, and refer the reader interested in further aspects of the theory of complex
multiplication to, for example, refs. [74, 75] and references therein.

For simplicity, since we follow the convention where CM-type Hodge structures are polarisable, in
this section we take all Hodge structures to be polarisable. However, several results generalise to
non-polarisable Hodge structures in an obvious fashion.

A.1. Commutative subalgebras

For instance ref. [118] defines that an irreducible polarisable Hodge structure (Vg, Vc) is of complex
multiplication (CM) type if the algebra of Hodge endomorphisms Endyag(Vq) contains a commu-
tative subalgebra € whose dimension as a vector space over Q is equal to the dimension of Vo,
dimg(€) = dimgVg. This condition is easily seen to be equivalent to the one used in the main
text. To see that our condition implies this one, we just note that if 7 : E © Endyag(Vo) is an
embedding of a number field of degree [E : Q] = dimg Vo, the image n(£) C Endyag(Vq) provides
a commutative subalgebra of dimension dimg(€) = [E : Q] = dimg Vo.

To see that the opposite implication holds, we use that Endyag(Vg) is a division algebra. Recalling
that any finite-dimensional unital subalgebra of a finite-dimensional division algebra is a division
algebra,‘ we have that the subalgebra € is a commutative division algebra, and thus a field. The
field € is isomorphic to a number field FE, as it includes the field QI of Q-multiples of the identity
matrix as a subfield, and this field is isomorphic to Q. Thus the inclusion E ~ € @ Endyag(Vo)
provides the required embedding of a number field E of degree [E : Q| = dimg Vg to Endyag (Vo).

A.2. Mumford—Tate group and Hodge tensors

There is an equivalent definition of a Hodge structure of CM type via the Mumford—Tate group.
While the above definition is more suited for explicit computations and suffices in particular for
understanding the construction presented in this paper, we find it useful to briefly introduce the
equivalent definition as well. The definitions we discuss here have in particular been used in physics
context in ref. [33], which also contains an excellent introduction to the Mumford—Tate group and
Hodge tensors. A detailed mathematical discussion can be found for example in ref. [74], which we
largely follow here.

Definition of Hodge structures via Deligne tori

To discuss the Mumford—Tate group of a Hodge structure, we need first to give an alternative
definition of a Hodge structure. Let us first define the Deligne torus S(R) and its maximal compact
subgroup U(R) as the R-algebraic groups given by

S(R) = {(4, ‘) ecL@r)} , Us {(4, ’) € sL@,R)} (Aa)

Note the isomorphisms S(R) ~ C* and U(R) ~ U(1) which are given by

—b a

(“ ') > atib =z. (A.2)

“We know that the dimension of a commutative subalgebra € is bounded by dimg Vo, and therefore if dimg € = Vo,
it must contain the identity matrix.

66
Let Vg be a Q-vector space. We say that it has a Hodge structure of weight m if there exists a
non-constant homomorphism of R-algebraic groups h : S(R) + GL(Vo ® R) such that for every
réR*c S(R)~C*

Rr) = rl, (A.3)

where J is the identity endomorphism of Vg := Vo ® R. We denote the Hodge structure as (Vg, h).
This is equivalent to the definition given in section 3.1 as, given a Hodge structure (Vo, Vc), we

can define such a morphism by defining h : S(R) 3 GL(Vo ® R) that for all z € S(R)
h(z)v = 2240, for ve vet. (A.4)

It is easy to show that the induced map on Va is indeed a homomorphism. Conversely, given a
homomorphism h : S(R) + GL(Vg) with the property (A.3), we can define the spaces V2" by

Ves {v Ee Ve | h(z) v = 2°71 y for all z€ s(R)} z (A.5)

It is simple to verify that over the complexification Vc := Vg ® C the simultaneous eigenspaces of
the automorphisms h(z) € GL(Vc) are all of this form with p+q =m. It is also often convenient
to consider the restricted morphism h : U(R) — SL(Vg), defined by

h (A.6)

= h lwaz) ¢

The Mumford-Tate group and complex multiplication

Let (Vo, h) be a Hodge structure. Following [74], we define the Mumford-Tate group (associated to
h), MT(h), to be the Q-algebraic closure of the image h(U(R)) C GL(Vg).“4 That is, MT(h) is the
smallest Q-algebraic subgroup of G containing h(U(R)):

MT(h) := A(U(R))*8 (A.7)

When the Hodge structure (Vo, h) is polarised with polarisation Q, the map h preserves the bilinear
form Q, as can be verified by a simple computation: ifv € V?4 and w € ve’ then Q(v, w) vanishes
and is thus preserved trivially unless p + p’ = q+ q' = m in which case for every z € U(z)

Q(h(z)v, h(z)w) = Q(z, P24 w) = 221 Q(v,w) = |2P?"Q(v,w) = Q(v,w). (A.8)
Therefore the for polarised Hodge structures, the Mumford—Tate group is in fact a subgroup of the
group G := Aut(Vg, Q) of automorphisms of Vg which preserve the polarisation Q.*°
A polarised Hodge structure (Vo, h) is said to be of CM-type if the Mumford—Tate group MT(h)
is Abelian, that is, an algebraic torus.

Hodge tensors

To see how this definition is connected to the one in terms of Hodge endomorphisms, we introduce
Hodge tensors as elements of the tensor spaces T*!' and the tensor algebra T** of Vo, which are
defined by

To = VE ave’, and Ty* = PI’. (A.9)
k,l>0

“4 As noted in [74], the group MT(h) defined in this way, is often also called the special Mumford-Tate group or
the Hodge group, and the group MT(h) defined as the Q-algebraic closure is called the Mumford—Tate group.
“The groups G are explicitly given by Sp(dimg Vo) for m odd and SO(S> Pee oaa 2?) for m even.

p even h

67
These spaces inherit a Hodge structure of weight m(k — 1) from that of Vg, as can be immediately
by using the definition in terms of the representation h : S(R) + GL(Vg ® R). To obtain a more
explicit description of the Hodge decomposition, we note that the complexification pee = aT gC

is isomorphic to the space of tensors of type (k,1) of the complexified spaces, pet oe ee ® (Ve).
In addition,

h(z) wv = 2 Pedy if vw E (VET ,
_ (A.10)
h(z) v1 @ vq = zPitP2gN+P yy @ vo if uw € VE .
We can write any t € 7 = a? ® C as a sum of vectors of the form
v= V1 @++@up@vy @+--@vu! ; with vVieE ve ; vy Ee (yer) ; (A.11)

and by the above formulae (A.10) each such vector satisfies

k L k l
R(z)v = 2 Bo, where Yori — Spi =F, Ya - Ir =s (A.12)
i=l i=1 i=l i=,

and thus by eq. (A.5) belongs to (Te Therefore we see that the complexification Te has a
decomposition of the form

Equivalence of definitions

To show that the definition of the CM-type Hodge structures in terms of the Mumford—Tate group
agrees with that given in section 3.4, we use the result (I.B.1) of [74] that the Mumford—Tate group
is exactly the subgroup of G = Aut(V,Q) that fixes the elements of Hg** pointwise.

Note that the algebra of Hodge endomorphisms Endyag(Vq) is isomorphic to the space He!!. This
follows as the elements of the space T; ta which has a Hodge structure of type (0,0), are tensors

te Vo® Vy . The condition that tc € Te be a Hodge class is that
te € (Te) = GB ver" @ (VERRY . (A.16)
Pind

Identifying the elements t € V @ VY with maps t : V — V, we see that these conditions imply
that the Hodge tensors of Tx correspond exactly to maps t : Vg + Vo whose complexifications tc
preserve the Hodge type in the sense of eq. (3.38).

The group GL(Vg), and thus the Mumford—Tate group MT(h), acts on pe by adjoint action,
and therefore the condition that g € GL(Ve) fix the elements of Hg** implies in particular that g

68
commutes with every Hodge endomorphism, using the correspondence established above. Assume
that there exists an embedding 7 : E © Endyag(Vo) with [EF : Q] = dimg Vo. Then n(£) is a
maximal commutative subalgebra of Endyag(Vq) and hence contains g, since g commutes with all
elements of 7(£). Thus MT(h) C n(E), so MT(h) must be Abelian.

The converse is also true: if the Mumford—Tate group MT(h) is Abelian and non-trivial, then
there exists an embedding of a number field E of degree [E : Q| = dimg Vg to the algebra of Hodge
endomorphisms Endyag(Va)- In fact, in this case Endyag(Vo) is isomorphic to a CM-field. We omit
the proof due to it being more lengthy, but the proof can be found in ref. [74] (Proposition (V.2)).

B. Complex Multiplication for Elliptic Curves

We wish to exemplify somewhat abstract definitions in section 3.4 and appendix A with a concrete
example of elliptic curves. The example in this section has also obvious parallels to the general
construction provided in section 3.5 and the examples of sections 4 and 5. We re-derive the famous
result that an elliptic curve has complex multiplication (i.e. its Hodge structure is of CM type) if
and only if the corresponding lattice parameter 7 belongs to a quadratic imaginary field. We will
necessarily be very brief and direct a reader interested in further details of the theory of elliptic
curves and their complex multiplication to refs. [111, 119}.

Let €, denote the elliptic curve isomorphic to the lattice quotient
Cc

Z+7Z’

where we can take 7 € H, and we denote the coordinate of C by x. We choose a basis {a, a1} of

H'(E,,Z) with the corresponding dual basis of Hy(E,,Z) being denoted by {A°, A'}. We define

the periods of €, as

&,& (B.1)

aw aap dz , so that da mao tata = w(ag+rTa1) , (B.2)
where we have used that the lattice parameter is given by tT = w!/w°.

B.1. Complex multiplication using Hodge endomorphisms

We find Endyag(H!(E-, Q)) by representing an arbitrary endomorphism y : H1(E,,Q) + H1(E,, Q)
as a matrix M € Mat(2x2,Q) in the basis ao, a1. Since H!°(E,,C) = (Aadz)e, the condition for
the endomorphism represented by M to preserve the Hodge structure can be written as

(: ‘) (7) =C (7) for some CEC. (B.3)

Writing out this condition gives two equations:

a-—C+0r 0, c-Cr+dr=0. (B.4)

This implies that the lattice parameter 7 must satisfy a quadratic equation. In particular, since
7 €H, it has to belong an imaginary quadratic field Q(/—D) for some D € Z,. By making an
SL(2, Q) transformation of basis if necessary, we can always take T to be purely imaginary.*® For
7 =ivVD, from the above equations it follows that

a b
MS { (by ‘)

Note that we have the algebra isomorphism

a, beg} ~ Endyag(H!(E;,Q)) (B.5)

Endpag(H!(E;,Q)) ~ Q(V=D), given by (hy ’) Ha+tb/—D, (B.6)

so we have the inclusion of a number field E = Q(/—D) of degree [(Q(V—D) : Q| to the endo-
morphism algebra given by this isomorphism. Therefore the Hodge structure has £-multiplication
according to the definition given in section 3.4. The polarisation for the Hodge structure is given by

Q(v,w) = = | vAw, (B.7)
Ey

so the Hodge structure H!(€,,Q) is of CM-type. We have thus shown, using Hodge endomorphism
algebra, that H!(€,,Q) is of CM-type if and only if 7 € Q(/—D) for some D € Z4.

‘SHere 7 is defined by (B.2) and in general longer is equal to the lattice parameter, as in general the required basis
transformation is not in SL(2,Z).

70
B.2. Complex multiplication using the Mumford—Tate group

We now re-derive this result by using the definition of CM in terms of the Mumford—Tate group
(see appendix A.2). We first find the map h : S(R) > GL(H1(E€,R)) defined in eq. (A.3), which
gives the alternative definition of the Hodge structure. We can easily find this map explicitly since
we know that it must act as

~ da daz ~ dz dz

U2) = = ea h(z) = = Za: (B.8)

fo)

If we represent the map h(z) by a matrix in the basis given by ag and ay, the above condition can

be written as (cf. eq. (B.3)

a(z) b(z)\ f1\ _ 1
e(z) d(z)) \r) Nr)
where a(z), b(z), c(z), d(z) € R. Solving these conditions gives

~ 1 272 — 271 22,
h =— B.10
u(z) 7) (22) +72) ztitzr) ’ ( )

where we have denoted tT = 71 + im, z = z1 +ize. The related map h : U(R) + SL(H1(E;,R)) is
given by restricting this to values of z such that |z|? = 1. As in eq. (A.7), the Mumford-Tate group
is defined as the Q-algebraic closure h(U(R))*8 of h(U(R)) C SL(H!(E,,R)) ~ SL(2,R).

Let us first explicitly show that when 7 € Q(./—D), the Mumford-Tate group is indeed Abelian,
and thus the Hodge structure is of CM-type as defined in appendix A.2. We can again, without
loss of generality, take t = iv D so that we have

nig) = C25 av? (B.11)

Any such matrix satisfies Q-algebraic equations, so the image is in fact Q-algebraically closed and
we can write it as

h(U(R))*8 = {(° ‘) € SL(H'(E,,R))

a=d, ¢ Db, ad aaa} ~ U(1). (B.12)

This shows that the Mumford—Tate group MT(h) := h(U(R))® ~ U(1) is Abelian, and therefore
the Hodge structure is of CM-type according to the definition of appendix A.2.

The reverse is also true, that is, if r ¢ Q(V—D) for any D € Zz, then the Mumford—Tate group is
not Abelian. To see this, we use the obvious fact that if 7 is not quadratic imaginary, then either
7 or |r|? is irrational. Then from eq. (B.10), it is relatively easy to see that the image h(U(R))
is not given by Q-algebraic equations. Therefore the Mumford—Tate group must be larger than
U(R). It can be shown that the Mumford—Tate group is a reductive subgroup of the automorphism
group G (see (I.B.6) of ref. [74]) which for elliptic curves is given by G = SL(H!(E,,R)) ~ SL(2, R).
However, there are only two such groups that are non-trivial, U(1) and SL(2, IR). We thus deduce
that MT(h) = SL(2,R), and therefore it is not Abelian.

Mumford-Tate group and Hodge tensors

‘We can also find the Mumford—Tate group by using the Hodge tensors. To keep the notation
compact, in this section, we denote H'(€,,Q) = Ho, and H1(€,,C) = Hc Consider the Hodge

71
tensors in Tt = Hg ® He. As can be seen from eq. (A.13), this space has an induced Hodge

structure of weight 0, so the Hodge classes of i are given by

; where (a) = (#e° ® (H¢°)”) ®@ (ae! ® (He")”) :

Hg! = (Ty')n (Te")

As discussed at the end of appendix A.2, by identifying the elements t € Hg ® Hg with maps
t: Hg — Hg, we see that the Hodge tensors in Hg!! are precisely the Hodge endomorphisms
(B.5). Recall also from the end of appendix A.2 that the Mumford—Tate group MT(h) is the
subgroup of G = SL(H'(€,,R)) that fixes the elements of Hg**, and consequently the elements of
Hg!!. The Mumford—Tate group acts on T° = Ag® Hy by the adjoint action, and therefore the
the elements of the Mumford—Tate group have to commute with the Hodge endomorphisms.

Since there are non-trivial Hodge endomorphisms only if tr € Q(/—D), let us consider this case,
and let M be a matrix representing an element of Endyag(H@), and let S be an arbitrary element
of the Mumford—Tate group.

_ a b _ fa B

Then the condition S~'MS = M for all a,b € Q implies that
S= ° B with a? + DB? = 1 (B.14)
—DB a)’ . .

By comparing to eq. (B.12) we that this is equivalent to requiring that S € h(U(R))*® ~ U(1), so
we again see that the Mumford—Tate group consisting of these matrices is Abelian if 7 € Q(V—D).

72
C. MN =2 Minimal Models with Boundary States in the NS-Sector

To illustrate a case where non-trivial stabiliser groups Stab(a) arise for some a € R, we consider
again minimal models. Unlike in section 4, however, we take the boundary states to lie in the
NS-sector. This choice gives rise to slightly different values of the relevant S-matrix elements,
which in turn necessitates analysis of stabiliser groups and the associated fixed fields. As the
purpose of this appendix is to illustrate these structures, we perform the analysis in two ways. The
first approach is analoguous to section 4, whereas the second one follows more closely the general
argument presented in section 3.5.

C.1. Proof using direct computation

As in section 4.2, we wish to explicitly construct the Hodge substructures of the Hodge structure
associated with the MV = 2 minimal models at level k. To do so, we find the field extensions
Q(S,q)), the stabiliser eroun Stab(r(l)) and the fixed field Q(S, wee () for every representation
r(1) defined in eq. (4.6).47

In order to construct the number field Q(S,q)), we observe that the modular S-matrix (4.10) for
the representations r(l) € R, c.f. eq. (4.6), can be written as

(ISP, ( (I41)(L+1—M)

Here we have used that the boundary labels (L, M,S') € HWRy(A)ng obey L+ M +S € 2Z. For
such states, it also follows that

Sy(1),(0,0,0) 2(1-+1)

S+(1),(0,2,0) +2)
which together with eq. (C.1) implies that Q(S,()) is generated by the root of unity igh ae =

ea, € Q(S,y), that is Q(S,~)) = QE ie ch To further simplify the expression of this cyclo-

toma ‘ wuniher eld, we decompose the integers /+ 1 and k+ 2 as
+1 = 275, kK+2 = 2d, with 61,5, € Z\ 2Z , (C.3)
in terms of the unique non-negative integral binary exponents r and s.

Then the number field Q(S,() can be expressed as*®

For the construction of the number field Q(Sr()) EO), we first determine the action of the Galois

group Gal(Q(S,,1))/Q) on the representations r(I) € R. We analyse the generic case r # s+1 (resp.
the non-generic case r = s +1). Recall from eqs. (4.24) and (4.25) that Gal(Q(¢,)/Q) ~ (Z/nZ)*,
and let pa € Gal(Q(¢2x)/Q) (resp. pa € Gal(Q(¢,)/Q)) be the Galois automorphism corresponding

As a consequence the Galois automorphism pg acts on the modular S-matrix (C.1) as

which on the set of representations R induces the action

Now we are ready to determine the stabiliser subgroup Stab(r(J)) of the Galois group Gal(Q(¢2x)/Q)
(resp. Gal(Q(¢,)/Q)) and number field Q(Sry SHAPE), For a given representation r(l) € R we
need to calculate the conjugacy classes [a] € (Z/2KZ)* (resp. [a] € (Z/KZ)*) with og(r(l)) =

As the classes [a] are represented by integers a modulo 2k (resp. a modulo «) and because 1 + K

as can be seen by noting that pii.(¢,) = —C,x- On these states, the field automorphisms 0, €

Gal(Q(¢..)/Q) corresponding to the elements [a] € (Z/KZ)* act as

6a |r(1)) = |Va(r(I))) =|r(')) , with O<U<k and l’=a(l+1)-1 modk+2. (C.16)

C.2. Proof using a tower of field extensions

There is an alternative way of establishing the Galois action of eqs. (C.9) and (C.10), which follows
more closely the discussion of section 3.5 by utilising the existence of the tower of field extension

Q(S) 2 Q(Sr~) 2 AS PO, (C.17)

and the fact that the Galois group Gal(Q(S)/Q) projects onto Gal(Q(S,(1))/Q). Since this way of
thinking helps to illustrate that of section 3.5 and more readily generalises to a wider variety of
theories, we discuss it briefly here. However, to keep this discussion as accessible as possible, we
restrict to the case where the level k is odd. The other cases can be treated with similar arguments.

To determine the number field Q(S) generated by the entries of the S-matrix (4.10), we note that®?

$(0,0,0),(1,-1.0 S(0,-2,0),(0,0.0 . S(1,1,0),(0,2,0
Gus) = (1+ (0,0,0).¢ ) di ) j= 2010020 (gy

8(0,-2,0),2,1,0) 7 \$.0.0),(1,-1,0) 1 — 5(o.=2.0,00,-20)
5(0,—2,0),(0,0,0)

By the expression (4.10), every S-matrix element can be generated by these so that

QS) = Qdae42),1) = Q(Caeray) - (C.19)

Then, as above, we determine the stabiliser groups Stab(r(/)) introduced in eq. (3.54), but this
time to do this we use the fact that the various field extensions we consider have the structure
displayed in figure 1 with the corresponding projections between the Galois groups.°!

Q(Cax) QUCi+2) (Z/2KZ)* (Z/(k+2)Z)*
(Z/KZ)*

Figure 1: Relations between different field extensions of Q relevant for
the study of the Galois symmetry of minimal models of an odd level k.

“Note that (0,0,0), (1,—-1,0), (0, 2,0), (1, 1,0), (0,2, 0) are representations contained in any minimal model for
arbitrary level k > 1.

°*'The inclusion Q(¢.) C Q(¢e+2) follows from the fact that for k odd Q(¢~) = Q(¢x/2), which is manifestly a
subfield of Q(¢k+2)-

75
Note that the short exact sequence

1 —+ Gal(Q(Caea2y)/Q(Ce+2)) —+ Gal(Q(Cace42))/Q) 2 Gal(Q(Cag42))/Q@) — 1, (C.20)

where 7 is induced from the map 7 in figure 1, splits so that we have

Gal(Q(S)/Q) ~ Gal(Q(Cayr42))/Q(Ce+2)) x Gal(Q(Gace42))/Q(i))

~ (Z/4Z)* x (Z/(k+2)Z) C.21)

Every element 04 € Gal(Q(C4(4+42))/Q) corresponds to a pair of elements
(1p, 9c) € Gal(Q(Ca(e-+2))/Q(Ce+2)) X Gal(Q(Carn42))/QG)) C:22)

with [b] € (Z/4Z)* and [ce] € (Z/(k+2)Z)* which act as
tw iro, Oc Ce42'—> Charo C.23)

and we can write the action of oq on any x € Q(S) as
oa(x) = (O-(x)) . C.24)

This correspondence is useful since the Galois group Gal(Q(¢,+2)/Q(i)) manifestly acts on the
set R of representations. To see this, let [ce] € (Z/(k+2)Z)*, and consider the action of 0, €
Gal(Q(¢,+2)/Q(i)). As above, from the form (C.1) of the S-matrix, we can immediately read off
the action of a:

e(Sy(i),(L,M,8)) = Sy(v),(L,M,S) with 0<<k, V Selt+ 1)—1 mod k+2, (C.25)

where l! 4 k+1 follows directly from the fact that c is invertible modulo k+2, so l/ = k+1 would
imply 1+1 = 0 mod k+2, which is not possible for 0 < 1 < k. Therefore we conclude that
0-(r(l)) = r(U’/) gives a well-defined permutation of R.

From this it follows that the elements pg € Gal(Q(¢2x)/Q) also have a well-defined action on
R. Namely, we can use the fact that every such element can be written as a restriction of some
field automorphism oq € Gal(Q(C4(4+42))/Q). In terms of the multiplicative groups of units, the
restriction morphism corresponds to the map p of figure 1 given explicitly by reduction modulo 2

p: [aj {d] , where a= b mod2k. (C.26)

Then it follows that for some oq € Gal(Q(¢4(44.2))/Q)

pa(Srq),(1,M,8)) = Fa(Sr(2,m,s)) = (Fc(Sry,(2,0,8))) = =Sy(v),(0.4,8) > (C.27)

where we have used that fact that from the form (C.1) of the S-matrix, it is manifest that 1, acts
by an overall sing. Note also that the field automorphism oq is not necessarily unique, but this
does not affect the above argument.

To find the group Stab(r(/)), we first find the kernel of the projection 7 from Gal(Q(¢4(442))/Q) to
Gal(Q(¢,+2)/Q(i)), given explicitly by reduction modulo k+2:

nm: {al [e], where a= b modk+2. (C.28)
The kernel of this map is given by

ker(7) = {{a] € (Z/4(k+2)Z) |a=1 mod k+2} = {[1+v(k+2)] | v € {0,2}} , (C.29)

76
where we have noted that the even integers 1 + (k+2) and 1 + 3(k+2) are not coprime to 4(k+2).

We can now use the restriction morphism (C.26) again. Under it, the image of ker(z) is {[1], [1 +
k]} C (Z/2KZ)*.°* Then, as in eq. (C.27), it follows that

Pise(Sr(t)(L,M,8)) = F142(b+2) (Sry (n.,s)) = (91(Sra(n,m,5))) = +Sr,(2,,5) > (C.30)

Therefore p}, € Stab(r(/)). Either recalling from section 3.5 that the group Stab(r()) is at most
of order 2, or by using an argument analogous to that in eq. (C.11), it follows that

Stab(r(l)) = (dite) ~ Z/2Z, (C.31)

which is the result (C.13) found above by direct computation.

To see this, note that [1 + 2(k+2)] maps to a non-trivial element of (Z/2«Z)* as otherwise we would have that
2K|2(k+2) which would imply that 4|2(k+2), but k+2 is odd. We know that [1 + 2(k+2)] = [1+ nk] for some n € Z
since «|2(k+2). The only non-trivial possibility is [1 + n«] = [1 + «].
