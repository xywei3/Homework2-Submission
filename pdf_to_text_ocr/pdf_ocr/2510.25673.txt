Abstract

Optical techniques for spatiotemporal control can produce laser pulses with custom
amplitude, phase, or polarization structure. In nonlinear optics and plasma physics, the
use of structured pulses typically follows a forward design approach, in which the efficacy
of a known structure is analyzed for a particular application. Inverse approaches, in
contrast, enable the discovery of new structures with the potential for superior
performance. Here, an implementation of the unidirectional pulse propagation equation
that supports automatic differentiation is combined with gradient-based optimization to
design structured pulses with features that are advantageous for a range of nonlinear
optical and plasma-based applications: (1) a longitudinally uniform intensity over an
extended region, (2) a superluminal intensity peak that travels many Rayleigh ranges with
constant duration, spot size, and amplitude, and (3) a laser pulse that ionizes a gas to
form a uniform column of plasma. In the final case, optimizing the full spatiotemporal
structure improves the performance by a factor of 15 compared to optimizing only spatial
or only temporal structure, highlighting the advantage of spatiotemporal control.

1 Introduction
Laser pulses structured in space, time, or coupled space-time provide additional degrees of freedom
for optimizing laser-based applications. The spatial structure can be two-dimensional, as in pulses
with constant orbital angular momentum (OAM) [1, 2], or three-dimensional, as in pulses with
tailored trajectories [3] or spatially varying OAM [4, 5]. Common examples of temporal structure
include pulse shape, chirp, or higher-order temporal and spectral phase. Coupled space-time
structure offers the greatest flexibility and enables custom evolution of the amplitude, phase, and
polarization [6-9]. A prominent realization is the “flying focus,” which features a peak intensity
that moves independently of the group velocity over many Rayleigh ranges [10-14]. While known
structures like these present new opportunities to enhance applications [15-22], they are somewhat
limited in their adaptability. The optimal structure for a particular application may combine
existing structures or take an entirely new form.
The optimization of laser-based applications with structured pulses has typically followed a
forward design approach, in which a known structure is evaluated for its ability to improve an
outcome such as efficiency or yield. The flying focus, for instance, has found utility in plasma and
nonlinear optical processes that require velocity matching or extended interaction lengths [11,
19-22]. Inverse design, by contrast, begins with a desired outcome and seeks a structure that
maximizes or minimizes that outcome. This approach can yield finely tuned optimizations of
existing structures or reveal undiscovered structures. High-dimensional inverse design is particularly
well suited to machine learning techniques for gradient-based optimization, where optimal input
parameters are obtained by minimizing a loss function that is chosen to produce a desired outcome.
Advances in software tools and specialized computing architectures have made gradient-based
optimization increasingly accessible to the scientific community. As an example, the JAX [23]

assumed to be cylindrically symmetric. In this configuration, the most general way to describe the
structure of the amplitude and phase is to specify their values at every point in configuration (r-t),
spectral (k,—w), or spatiospectral (e.g., r-w) space. However, optimizing over such a large
parameter space could be challenging. To facilitate optimization, reduced representations for the
near-field amplitude E and phase ¢ are used instead, where the hat denotes quantities that can be
adjusted by the gradient descent algorithm. The amplitude is defined using familiar optical
uantities, while the phase is parameterized to allow for a direct mapping onto optical elements
such as diffractive optics, metasurfaces, spatial light modulators, or mirrors with custom sagitta.
More specifically, the near-field amplitude is expressed in terms of a coefficient A(r), central
frequency @(r), pulse duration 7(r), and an exponent p that describes the super-Gaussian order of

the spectral profile:
1 2 r \*° #(r) |?

where wo is the near-field spot size of an approximately flat-top profile. The phase is decomposed
into a polynomial expansion in frequency about a reference frequency wo and an expansion in
cylindrically symmetric Zernike polynomials Z°(p) (defined in Appendix A). The coefficients of this
expansion define the elements of the 4 x 4 matrix L:

where 7g is the aperture radius, c is the vacuum speed of light, fo is a nominal focal length, and
Aw = w — wo. Element — represents the contribution with power m in frequency and radial
profile Z°(r/ro). Successive powers of frequency equal to 0, 1, 2, and 3 in the matrix Q represent
diffractive contributions, radial group delay, radial chirp, and radial third-order spectral phase,
respectively. An ideal lens, for example, has lea = Vier = hie = ie = 1, with all other elements equal
to zero. Once the near-field profile Ee’? is specified, the pulse is propagated to the far field using
the Fresnel diffraction integral (see Appendix B), providing the initial condition for far-field
propagation with the UPPE.

2.2 Far-field propagation
With the initial condition determined, the UPPE is used to propagate the laser pulse through the
far field. The UPPE is a reduced form of the electromagnetic wave equation that neglects
backward-moving waves and their contribution to any nonlinearities [38-40]. By avoiding a
paraxial or slowly varying envelope approximation, the UPPE is capable of modeling neutral
dispersion to all orders and nonlinear processes such as harmonic generation and carrier steepening.
These features have made the UPPE a standard for modeling processes such as filamentation, THz
generation, and supercontinuum generation.

In the UPPE implementation used here, the cylindrically symmetric electric field is linearly
polarized perpendicular to the propagation direction. Configuration-space quantities are expressed
in terms of the longitudinal coordinate z, radius r, and time t. Transformations to spectral space
are made using quasi-discrete Hankel transforms [41] from r to the transverse wave number k, and
Fourier transforms from t to frequency w. When expressed in a frame moving at speed v¢ along the
z-direction, the UPPE takes the form

er iK (kp,w)E = S(ky,w, E), (3)
Oz
where the tilde indicates a quantity is in spectral space, E(kp, w,z) is the electric field,
K (kr, W) = kz — w/ve, kz = \/n?(w)w?/e2 — k2, and n(w) is the linear refractive index. The
right-hand side of Eq. (3) contains the nonlinear polarization density of the gas P,, the current
density of the plasma Ips and an effective current that accounts for the energy lost due to

where nz is the nonlinear refractive index, ven is the electron—neutral collision frequency, ne is the
electron density, w(E) is the photoionization rate, ny, is the neutral density, and Uj is the ionization
energy. The electron density and neutral densities evolve according to 0jne = w(E)ny and
Ny = No — Ne, Where no is the initial neutral density. In practice, Eq. (6) is solved in spectral space
to avoid integrating in time.
The UPPE is solved with a second-order predictor—corrector scheme for the nonlinear source
terms (see Appendix C). The Ammosov—-Delone-Krainov (ADK) [42] rate is used for w(E), and a
fixed electron-neutral collision frequency vey is implemented in Eq. (6) to account for inverse
bremsstrahlung absorption. The linear refractive index n(w) is obtained from the Sellmeier
equation provided in Ref. [43]. All computations employ the JAX [23], NumPy [24], SciPy [44],
Diffrax [45], and Equinox [46] libraries, and the complete differentiable program is called
SUPER-JAX (Simulation of the Unidirectional pulse Propagation Equation at Rochester in JAX).

2.3 Parameter implementation and optimization
Far-field quantities, such as the electric field and electron density, are used to define a scalar loss
function £ that approaches a minimum as the quantities near the desired behavior. The
minimization is accomplished with gradient-based optimization of the near-field parameters
expressed by A(r), &(r), 7(r), p, and L as defined in Sec. 2.1 (and denoted by @ in Fig. 1). The
form of these parameters and their allowed variation directly influence the efficacy of the algorithm.
This section describes the methodology used for the form and variation.

Optimization algorithms are generally more stable and converge more quickly when adjustable
parameters are of order unity. At the same time, the optimal values of the linn may span many
orders of magnitude. To address this, each element les in Eq. (2) is implemented as

inn = 1, +10!» — 10hmm, (8)

mn

The /°,,, term is fixed and specifies the initial phase of the electric field, e.g., 1 in the upper-left

quadrant of L and 0 elsewhere to model the phase applied by an ideal lens. The [*,,, and lve terms

are initialized to the same value, which sets the sensitivity of ln to variations in [> ,,. For example,

setting (+, and [;,,, to 0 (-3) means that variations of +0.05 in [%,, change linn by +0.1 (£0.0001).
In other words, /°,,, is a constant that determines the initial phase, and (+, and [7,,, are optimized

mn
by the algorithm to find the phase or, w) that minimizes CL.
As opposed to the finite number of parameters that determine 6 (Le., the 32 it,.), the
coefficient, frequency, and duration comprising E should mimic continuous functions of r and, in
principle, may have arbitrarily many parameters. Two implementations for these functions are
used here. The first method balances generality and complexity by representing A(r), @(r), and
7(r) with cubic B-splines. In this method, the parameters correspond to the weight of each
B-spline, allowing the user to regulate the smoothness and variability of the functions by adjusting
the number of B-splines. To enforce physical constraints (e.g., finite bandwidth), the spline outputs
are passed through a hyperbolic tangent before initializing the pulse to limit the minimum and
maximum function values (see Appendix D).
The second method for implementing the near-field radial functions discretizes each function
into np parameters on a uniform grid along the near-field radius. In this method, the parameters
are the function values on the grid. The number of parameters can be equal to or less than the
number of points yf in the near-field radial simulation grid. If np = ny, then the parameter grid
exactly overlays the simulation grid, i.e., each function value is set by a single parameter. If
Np < Mnf, then linear interpolation is used between the parameters to compute the npr function
values on the simulation grid. Because this representation introduces many free parameters, the
resulting functions can vary rapidly with radius. Smoothing is applied with a moving average of
100 points on a grid containing nur = 1600 points to reduce the variation. Similar to the spline
method, the outputs are passed through a hyperbolic tangent function to enforce constraints.

The choice of electric field parameterization strongly impacts convergence. The three cases
described in Sec. 3 were evaluated with both the B-spline and discretized implementations, each of
which resulted in different optimized pulses. Only the best performer is presented, with cases 1 and

3 using 20 B-splines and case 2 using 1600 discrete parameters. Other approaches to the
parameterization include representing the functions with alternative basis sets or neural networks.
The convergence is also sensitive to the initial conditions, the choice of loss function, and the
learning rate of the optimizer. Several optimizers were tested, and the L-BFGS-B method of the
SciPy minimize function proved effective in all cases studied. Due to the many choices that affect
convergence, the results presented here are not intended to be exhaustive or to represent global
optima, but rather to show workable solutions that demonstrate the capabilities of AD in nonlinear
optics and plasma physics.

3 Results

This section presents three simulations that demonstrate the utility and flexibility of
gradient-based optimization for the inverse design of structured laser pulses. The first two cases are
simulated in vacuum, while the third includes the effects of all nonlinear source terms in Eq. (4).
Case 1 is initialized with a monochromatic, continuous wave and produces an extended focal region
of constant intensity. Case 2 starts with a finite-duration pulse and creates a superluminal intensity
peak that travels many Rayleigh ranges with constant spot size, duration, and amplitude. Case 3
modifies a finite-duration pulse to generate a uniform column of plasma. The initial phase of the
electric field is always set to that of an ideal focusing lens. In each case, the loss function L is
reduced by at least a factor of 15 from its initial value Lo.

Table 1 summarizes the parameters for each simulation, including the near-field pulse profile,
far-field domain, and optimization metrics. The initial wavelength \o corresponds to the frequency
wo at which w is initialized, and U is the initial pulse energy. Physical constraints on A, w, and T
are listed as minimum, initial, and maximum values (e.g., Amin, Ao, and Amax). The number of
UPPE grid points are given in radius, time, and longitudinal space as n,, n,;, and nz, respectively.
The corresponding physical dimensions of the domain are the maximum radius Rmax, temporal
width 7, and longitudinal width L,. The longitudinal distance over which the loss function is
integrated is given as Lioss. The number of iterations nop_ and the total wall-clock time Tyan are
also included. For case 1, convergence was reached after 409 iterations (1.7 hrs), whereas cases 2
and 3 continued optimizing for the full job duration (maximum of 48 hrs).

3.1 Case 1: longitudinally uniform intensity

Unlike ideal lenses, which focus laser beams to a single plane, axicons [47, 48] and axiparabolas [49]
produce longitudinally extended focal regions. Although these optics can be designed to yield an
approximately uniform intensity profile, they often create longitudinal modulations in the on-axis
intensity. Many applications that rely on an extended focal region would benefit from a truly
constant intensity profile.

The goal of the first simulation is to produce a longitudinally extended focal region with
uniform intensity in vacuum. A monochromatic electric field is considered, requiring only spatial
structuring through A and the first row of L (corresponding to zeroth-order terms in powers of
frequency). The loss function is defined as £L = f |Isim(r = 0, z) — Itarget(z)| dz, where I = ceo|E|?/2
is the intensity. Figure 2 shows (a) the optimized on-axis intensity profile (blue) alongside the
target intensity profile (dashed orange), and (b) the optimal near-field coefficient A. The converged
intensity is relatively flat and closely matches the target across the region included in the loss
function. The optimal coefficients from the first row of L are listed in the first row of Tab. 2.

An axiparabola generates an extended focal region that resembles the target intensity profile,
albeit with modulations in the on-axis intensity. The green dashed—dotted line in Fig. 2(a) shows
the intensity pattern for an axiparabola with a positive focal region of 2 cm, specified by the
Zernike coefficients listed in the second row of Tab. 2. These coefficients are similar to those
learned by the algorithm, but the loa term has opposite sign. The additional element los = —0.0005
in the learned phase is an important modification, without which the loss value rises by a factor of
6. For comparison, the axiparabola with a radially uniform A results in a loss value 7x greater
than the optimum. This comparison illustrates how forward design can identify pulse-shaping
techniques that produce a desirable effect, while inverse design can further refine or discover new
pulse structures for specific applications.

3.2 Case 2: spatiotemporally uniform intensity

Many applications—such as laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) [19-21] and THz

generation [22]—require an intensity peak that moves with a prescribed velocity, finite duration,
and constant spot size over an extended region. Several methods have been proposed to produce
such intensity peaks [10-12, 50, 51], but these approaches involve trade-offs among non-uniform
intensity, variable spot size, and limitations on the minimum pulse duration. As an example, an
axiparabola combined with a radially stepped echelon produces an intensity peak with an
ultrashort duration and a custom trajectory favorable for LWFA [20, 51], but the resulting spot
size variation can complicate the interaction [21].

The goal of the second simulation is to create an intensity peak with uniform intensity, duration
(40 fs), and spot size (10 wm) that propagates at a superluminal velocity (1.005c) over many
Rayleigh ranges (8 mm, or 27 Rayleigh ranges). All parameters in E and a) are allowed to vary, and
A, 7, and w are implemented with 1600 discrete points. The pulse energy is held constant at
0.1 mJ. The loss function is defined as L = f |Isim(7,t, 2) — Ltarget (1, t, z)| dr dt dz, and regions in r
and t are included only where Jtarget is within 90% of its maximum value.

The optimized intensity profile closely reproduces the desired behavior and is shown in Fig. 3 as
a function of (a) z and t — z/c and (b) r and z. In (a), the intensity peak propagates with the
specified superluminal velocity, and regions of high intensity are mainly concentrated along the
target trajectory (dashed line). The spot size in (b) is fit to 1/e? of the intensity and remains
nearly constant, varying by only 6% over the region of interest (between 0.4 and 1.2 mm in z). For
comparison, an axiparabola-echelon combination that achieves the same focal velocity, focal region,
and duration has a spot size that varies by a factor of 2.4 over the target region [21, 49, 51]. The
near-field pulse shape exhibits variations in the coefficient, central frequency, and duration [see
Fig. 3(c-f)], yielding a complex structure that is unlikely to result from forward design. The
coefficient function shown in (d) is largest between approximately 1.4 and 2.3 cm. This radial
concentration of the pulse energy was also employed in Ref. [48] to reduce spot size variation when
focusing with axicons.

via the coefficient fy9 = —0.9872. Chirped pulses have been employed in previous flying-focus
implementations [10-12], but typically with diffractive optics (e.g., loo = lo2 = 1 with all other

elements of L set to 0). Here, the chirp is combined with a chromatic focusing optic exhibiting

additional spherical aberration. This aberration plays a key role; for instance, without the large loa
term the loss value increases by a factor of 41. The third-order spectral phase terms in the last row
of Tab. 3 remain small.

3.3 Case 3: Spatially uniform density
Cases 1 and 2 focused on producing an extended, uniform intensity in the far field. Many
plasma-based applications further benefit from a uniform, pre-ionized plasma density that enables
pulses to propagate without extraneous energy loss or distortion from ionization effects. Localized
ionization can cause refraction, and plasma introduces additional dispersion during propagation.
Because of these effects, the optimal structured pulse for creating a uniform plasma column may
differ from a structured pulse that produces a uniform intensity in vacuum.

The third and final simulation aims to generate a 1.6-mm-long, 4-jm-radius column of uniform

plasma using a single laser pulse. Hydrogen gas at atmospheric density is used as the propagation
medium, with an ionization potential U; = 13.6 eV and a nonlinear refractive index
nz = 7.5 x 10-74 m?/W. The pulse energy is held constant at 0.3 mJ, but all other parameters are
allowed to vary. The near-field radial functions are implemented with 20 B-splines. The loss
function, evaluated at the final simulation time t,, is defined as L = f Nsim(T, te, Z) — Mtarget| dr dz,
where the integration is restricted to the central 1.6 mm in z and the four innermost radial cells
(r <4 pm).
The converged results shown in Fig. 4 demonstrate a type of superluminal flying focus similar
to the “flying focus X,” where the central frequency increases quadratically with radius [50, 52].
The electron density is shown in (a) as a function of z for the four innermost radial cells (shades of
blue) along with the target density of 6 x 10!° cm~* (dashed orange). The electron density profile
produced by the pulse is nearly equal to the target value across most of the region. The (b) far-field
on-axis intensity peak propagates with a superluminal velocity of 1.14c, and the (c) near-field
electric field amplitude has a central frequency that increases quadratically with radius. The
individual near-field coefficient, central frequency, and duration are plotted in (d-f). All 16
coefficients of L shown in Tab. 4 were allowed to vary, yet the values indicate only modest chromatic
focusing, primarily through the Iz and fy) terms. This slight deviation from an ideal lens,
combined with the spectral amplitude shown in Fig. 4(c), is sufficient to produce the target density.
Two additional tests were performed to demonstrate the importance of spatiotemporal
structure in creating a uniform plasma profile: the first optimized only spatial structure (i.e., A and

the first two rows of L, with Ion = tix), and the second optimized only temporal structure (i.e., @
and 7 as constants rather than radial functions, p, and the first column of L, with lo2 = loo and

iyo = b9). The resulting density profiles are shown in Fig. 5(b) and (c), respectively, along with
(a) the original, unoptimized case and (d) the optimized case with full spatiotemporal structuring.
The ratio of final to initial loss values £/L£o is reported for each case. Optimizing with only spatial
and only temporal structuring in (b) and (c) gives almost no improvement, reducing the loss by
just 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. A large improvement is achieved only when the phase and
amplitude are optimized together in (d), reducing the loss by 93%.

4 Discussion and conclusion
A differentiable implementation of the UPPE enables the inverse design of spatiotemporal
structures optimized for both linear and nonlinear processes. The optimization loop involves four
steps. First, the near-field spatiospectral amplitude and phase of an incident laser pulse are
parameterized as described in Sec. 2.1. The pulse is then propagated to the far field, after which
the UPPE system presented in Sec. 2.2 is solved using the JAX Python package—complete with
native GPU acceleration and AD. The third step evaluates a customized single-output loss function
that is defined to yield desired features in the far field when minimized. Finally, the near-field
parameters are optimized by a gradient descent algorithm, with gradients of the loss function
obtained through reverse-mode AD.

Optimization was performed for the three test cases described in Sec. 3, and the loss function
decreased substantially in each case (see the last row of Tab. 1). In case 1, optimization of the
coefficient A and the phase demonstrated the ability of inverse design to improve upon existing

structures, such as those produced by an axiparabola. In case 2, the full Eet* expression was
optimized to produce a rich near-field structure that would likely only emerge through inverse
design. The optimization in case 3 generated a type of flying focus that achieved the desired

behavior, which was only possible with full spatiotemporal control.

The utility of the differentiable framework ultimately hinges on whether the structured pulses
can be realized in the laboratory. For instance, due to its few-percent bandwidth and relatively
smooth profile, the near-field electric field profile obtained in case 3 [Fig. 4(a)] may be easier to
realize than the profile from case 2 [Fig. 3(c)]. Further studies could investigate the significance of
the rapid variations in A, @, and 7 observed in Fig. 3(d-f). These functions could be smoothed,
then simulated again to test whether the variations are essential for good performance.
Alternatively, the optimization loops could be restarted using the converged solution (or a
smoothed version of it) as an initial condition. Restarting the loop in this way could improve the
converged result, since the L-BFGS-B minimization method retains a history of gradients and
parameter updates. A stochastic gradient descent algorithm could also be tested. Once a
sufficiently simple pulse structure is determined for a given application, a range of experimental
techniques for generating spatiotemporally structured light [50, 51, 53-58] could then be leveraged
to produce the desired pulse.

The parameterization of the incident electric field amplitude and phase described in Sec. 2.1 is
only one possible approach to characterizing spatiotemporal pulse shapes, and other
parameterizations may yield pulses with improved performance. Several descriptions more general
than Eqs. (1) and (2) were tested: using B-splines to represent a functional form
F[(w — &(r)) * #(r)| for the spectral amplitude instead of a super-Gaussian, a two-dimensional
B-spline representation of E (r,w), and replacing the LZ matrix product with four free-form
functions of radius 1, m(1). In each case, however, the optimization algorithm produced noisy
far-field solutions with larger final loss values compared to the results presented in Sec. 3. The right
balance must be found between generality and tractability in choosing the field parameterization.

As tools for AD and GPU acceleration become more widely available, gradient-based
optimization of physics simulations is poised to become an important tool for research and
discovery. For future work, this differentiable framework could be applied to the inverse design of
structured pulses for other nonlinear optical processes, including perturbative harmonic generation,
high-harmonic generation, long-distance pulse propagation in air sustained by self-focusing and
ionization refraction, and the generation of terahertz radiation. Further analysis of the results
presented here could yield deeper insight into the spatiotemporal structure of the optimized pulses
and guide strategies for their experimental realization.

Appendix A. Zernike polynomial definitions
The normalization for the Zernike polynomials is defined such that
(2n + 2) So Z°(p)Z2,(p)p dp = Snn. The four Zernike polynomials used in Eq. (2) are then

Z(p) =1 (9)
Z3(p) = 2p? —1 (10)
Z4(p) = 6p* — 6p? +1 (11)
Z§(p) = 20p® — 30p* + 12p? — 1. (12)

Appendix B. Transforming from the near field to the far field
The near-field electric field E(r, wheter) is computed from the product of the spectral amplitude
and phase, which are defined in Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively. The far-field electric field at focus is
found by computing the Fresnel diffraction integral as follows:

E(r,w, fo) = -——-efo [ Bewye% “eho Jo ( - ) r dr’, (13)

where r’ is the near-field radius and Jo is the zeroth-order Bessel function of the first kind. To
initialize the simulation at the specified longitudinal location zo, the transformed electric field is
multiplied by the linear evolution operator,

which can be derived from Eq. (19) with S' = 0.

Appendix C. Predictor—corrector scheme for the unidirectional pulse propagation
equation
This appendix details the predictor—corrector scheme used to solve the UPPE in the spectral
domain, as defined in Eq. (3). First, the electric field is written as E= E(k, w, z)e'**, reducing
Eq. (3) to

where the shorthand 5(E(z)) has been used for S(kp,w, E(z)). Equation (15) can be integrated

Equations (18) and (19) give the solution. This method of solving the UPPE is similar to Heun’s
method (a second-order Runge-Kutta method with two stages), and would be exactly Heun’s
method if B*(zo + Az) = E(zo)e**4* + Aze'*4*$(E(zo)) was used in place of Eq. (19).

Appendix D. Parameter constraints
The parameters contained in A(r), @(r), and 7(r) can take any value determined by the
optimization algorithm, including values that may not be physical. For instance, the algorithm
could adjust the bandwidth or pulse duration to be outside of the range achievable by a realistic
laser system. Additionally, it may be desired to limit the relative contrast in A(r), even while the
energy is kept constant. To constrain the values of the near-field functions, their raw output is
passed through a hyperbolic tangent function before being used to compute the near-field
amplitude E. As an example, let A(r) ) denote the direct output of the coefficient function after
parameterization with either B-splines or discrete points (see Sec. 2.3). The coefficient function
used in the calculation of Eq. (1) is then

> 1 >

A(r) = Amin + 5 (Amax — Amin) {1+ tanh [3 (A(r) 1+ Asnite) ] (20)
where Amin (Amax) is the minimum (maximum) value allowed for the coefficient and

Asgnitt = log [(Amin — Ao)/(Ao — Amax)] /6. Defined in this way, initializing the raw output to

A(r) = 1 corresponds to A(r) = Ao, and any learned values —oo < A < 00 will yield an output
Amin < A < Amax:
