Abstract

The degeneracy of central configurations in the planar N-body problem makes their
enumeration problem hard and the related dynamics appealing. The degeneracy is
always intertwined with the symmetry of the system of central configurations which
makes the problem subtle. By analyzing the Jacobian matrix of the system, we sys-
tematically explore the direct method to single out trivial zero eigenvalues associated
with translational, rotational and scaling symmetries, thereby isolating the non-trivial
part of the Jacobian to study the degeneracy. Three distinct formulations of degeneracy
are presented, each tailored to handle different formulation of the system. The method
is applied to such well-known examples as Lagrange’s equilateral triangle solutions for
arbitrary masses, the square configuration for four equal masses and the equilateral tri-
angle with a central mass revealing specific mass values for which degeneracy occurs.
Combining with the interval algorithm, the nondegeneracy of rhombus central configu-
rations for arbitrary mass is established.

1 Introduction

A classical problem in celestial mechanics is to count all the central configurations in the
planar N-body problem. A central configuration is a special arrangement of the position vec-
tors for the given mass vector of N bodies, which can generate a homographic or homothetic
solution of the equations for the N-body problem. Euler ({/5]]) and Lagrange ({9]]) completed
the enumeration of the collinear three-body central configurations and the planar equilateral
triangle central configurations, respectively. For N > 4 the problem seems too difficult for
a complete solution. Moulton ({I7]) proved that there are exact N!/2 central configurations
for the collinear N-body problem. Until 1996, Albouy ({[I}) completed the enumeration of
the planar four body central configurations for four equal masses. For the state of the art,
please refer to ((13]) and references therein. Note that the enumeration is always up to the
translation, rotation and scaling symmetry of the central configuration system to which we
will return in §2.

One of the difficulties for the counting problem comes from the existence of degeneracy
or bifurcation of central configurations for certain masses, which causes change of number
of central configurations. Degeneracy or bifurcation has been observed for many years.
However, only a few cases have been studied.

The story started with Palmore ({18], 1975) who proved that when m, = m2 = m3 are
placed at the vertices of an equilateral triangle and 0 < m4 < mj such that m4 = mj with

central configuration of the planar 4-body problem. This was to answer a question raised by
Smale ((23], 1974) which asks whether there exists a degenerate central configuration in the
planar N-body problem for any N > 4. Then Palmore ( [19], 1976) extended his example to
the (N + 1)-body problem with arbitrary N(> 4) bodies at the vertex of a regular polygon
and a mass at the center of the configuration. But he didn’t show whether the degeneracy
gives rise to a bifurcation. Meyer and Schmidt ((14) [I5], 1987, 1988) proved that these
degeneracy do give rise to a bifurcation for N = 3 and N=4. Shi and Xie ((24], 2010)

m,/m, = is placed at the center of the triangle, the configuration is a degenerate
use analytic methods to show that there is exactly one family of concave isosceles triangle
central configuration bifurcating from equilateral triangle configuration with one at center.

Simo ((26], 1977) presented a complete numerical study on bifurcations of the central
configurations in the 4-body problem. Rusu and Santoprete ({22], 2015) investigate the
bifurcations of central configurations of the planar four-body problem when some of the
masses are equal. Using the Krawczyk operator of interval computation and some result
of equivariant bifurcation theory, they provided a rigorous computer-assisted proof for the
existence of such bifurcations and classified them as pitch fork and fold bifurcations.

Gannaway ({6], 1981) and Arenstorf ({2], 1982) presented the analytical studies of de-
generacy and bifurcations in a restricted four-body central configuration with three arbitrary
masses and a fourth small one. It was shown that each three-body collinear central con-
figuration generates exactly two non-collinear central configurations (besides four collinear
ones) of four bodies with small m4 > 0; and that any three-body equilateral triangle central
configuration generates exactly 8, 9 or 10 (depending on the primary masses m,,m2,™m3)
planar four-body central configurations with m4 = 0. Xia ((28],1991) estimated the num-
bers of central configurations for some open sets of positive masses by using the method of
analytical continuation or implicit function theorem. Interestingly, the bifurcations of cen-
tral configurations may occur at collisions between two zero masses. Roberts ({21], 2025)
recently proved the uniqueness of convex kite central configurations by using tools from dif-
ferential topology and computational algebraic geometry. He also investigated concave kite
central configurations, including degenerate examples and bifurcations. Wang ([27]], 2025)
also studied the degeneracy of central configuration in full space. Liu and Xie ({10], 2025)
established the existence of bifurcations in symmetric configurations with two pairs of equal
masses. Building on the results of [22], their work shows that a central configuration may
serve as a degenerate central configuration in the full space while appearing as a regular cen-
tral configuration in a restricted subspace. Moreover, a central configuration may also act
as a degenerate central configuration both in the full space and within a subspace. There-
fore, it is necessary to investigate whether a central configuration constitutes a degenerate
configuration in the full configuration space.

Due to the invariance of central configurations under rotation, translation and scaling,
the Jacobian matrix of the governing equations typically exhibits trivial zero eigenvalues.
These eigenvalues complicate the study of degeneracy, as they obscure the true nature of the
system’s critical points. Previous works have addressed this issue by employing appropriate
coordinates tailored to the specific configurations to reduce the number of variables and
eliminate these trivial zeros.

In this paper, we introduce a more direct approach: we systematically remove the trivial
zero eigenvalues from the Jacobian matrix itself, enabling a clearer analysis of degeneracy.
We then apply this method to several well-known central configurations, illustrating its effec-
tiveness in revealing their structural properties. Finally, combining with interval algorithm
we establish the nondegeneracy of rhombus central configurations for any given mass. The
paper is arranged as follows. In section 2} we recall the system of central configurations and
its symmetries. In section [3] depending on the formulation of the system of central config-
urations, we give three forms of the definition of degeneracy of central configurations, and
several well-known examples of central configurations are used to illustrate how the def-
initions work. Combining with the interval algorithm, we establish the nondegeneracy of
rhombus central configurations for any given mass in section |4} Various comments are given
in the concluding section |5}

2 Central configuration and its symmetries

Consider the Newtonian N-body problem with positive masses m,m2,--- ,my in the plane
R*. The position vector of the particles is given by g = (q1,@2,:-:,qn)? € R°%, with the
position of i-th particle g; = (x;,y;)’ € R* for i= 1,2,--- ,N. Let the collision set A = {q€
R* |qi=4 ; for some i # j}. The motion of N celestial bodies is determined by Newton’s
law of universal gravitation

where rj; = ||gi — q;\| is the Euclidean distance between q; and qg;. A central configuration is
a special arrangement of particles such that the force on each body points toward the center
of mass and is proportional to its position with respect to the center of mass

Equivalently central configurations can be characterized as the critical points. Let us

Clearly U is a smooth function on R2%\A. Then the equation of central configuration
can be written as
oU 1, a

6 + -A— =0, fori=1,2,---,N.
el ogi 2 Ogi

This means that central configurations are critical points of U restricted to the constant mo-
ment of inertia J = Jo by the Lagrange multiplier theorem, or equivalently, they are critical
points of /7U in the whole configuration space. If g is a central configuration corresponding
to the positive A, then the constant must satisfy

4 = UD. 6

thanks to the homogeneity of U and J.

Inspired by the previous discussions, in its most general form the equations of central
configuration can be written as

N
7) F(q.m)= S) ™ 4 4) m(qi—c)=0,  1<i<N,

with g; = [x;,y;]’, the potential U and the moment of inertia J given by and (5) respec-
tively, and c understood as (2). This system suggests us to define the mapping

F:RNxRN = RY
(8) (q.m) ++ F(q.m) =[Fi(q.m))’.

It is evident that if g is a central configuration, its translations, rotations or scalings
are also central configurations. In other words, the equations of central configurations
are invariant under translations, rotations and scalings. So, more precisely, we say that two
planar central configurations q,q € (IR?) are equivalent if there exist a constant scalar k € R,
a constant vector b € R?, and a 2 x 2 rotation matrix A € SO(2) such that

qi=kAGitb, i=1,...,N.
A side remark is that the allowed symmetries of the equations of central configurations de-
pend on the form of the equations. For example, the equation @) or equivalently, equation
(6) is not scaling invariant.

The concept of a nondegenerate central configuration should take into account all the
above invariance (see Palmore [19] and Meyer [14]). Let M Cc R2" be a linear subspace
given by

N
(9) M = {qER: "mig = 0},
i=l

ie., fixing the center of mass to be the origin. Let § = {q € M :I(q) = 1} and®=S/~
where ~ is the equivalence relation g ~ g if g = Ag where A is a 2 x 2 rotation matrix. Let
Iq) ={G € S:G~q}. Since U is invariant under rotations, it induces a well-defined function
u:®\A — R by U((g]) = U(q). A central configuration g is called nondegenerate if the
Hessian of @ at [g] is non-singular. Although this definition is conceptually clear, the quo-
tient space is awkward to work with when determining the nondegeneracy and bifurcation
of central configurations because there is no a canonical way to choose local coordinates to
calculate the Hessian.

There is another common practice in the literature to get ride of the symmetry, namely
putting constrains to work in a subspace. For example for planar problem, one can fix the
relative positions of two bodies at one coordinates axis to kill the rotation and scaling sym-
metry. Again, there is no a canonical way to put the constraints.

Instead of working with quotient space or adding extra restrictions, we give three dif-
ferent forms to directly study the degeneracy in the original full configuration space R2% \A
while explicitly accounting for the inherent symmetries. In each formulation, we systemat-
ically eliminate the trivial zero eigenvalues from the Jacobian matrix. The resulting reduced
matrix characterizes the genuine degeneracy of a central configuration through its determi-
nant, providing a unified and computationally efficient procedure. Without this reduction,
one must compute the entire spectrum of the Jacobian matrix to determine whether a central
configuration is degenerate, which is more difficult to carry out. Although the three forms
are essentially equivalent more or less, they have different presentations when we study the
degeneracy, which affects the concrete computations and the final forms of the results. That
is why we need to address this issue with care. Even though they all appear in the literature
in various forms, it is difficult to find a place where all of these forms were put together
coherently. We include them here for completeness and for readers’ convenience.

Based on these formalisms, we prove the nondegeneracy of rhombus central configura-
tions of planar 4-body problem for any mass.
3 Degeneracy

3.1 Definition of degeneracy in general

Definition 3.1 (Degeneracy). Let F : RY x RY” — R% be a smooth function. Assume that
F(qo,mo) =0. The function F is said to be degenerate at the root (go,m0) € R” x R™ if
the differential of F w.r.t. g at (qo,mo) is not full rank. That is, degeneracy occurs if the
Jacobian matrix Jac(F)| (q9,mo) Of F w.t.t. q evaluated at (qo,mo) has rank less than N.

Root (go,mo) is called a bifurcation point if there exists a small neighborhood around
(go,mo) in which the number of roots of the equation F (x,m) = 0 changes as the parameter
m varies.

In general, if (go, mo) is a bifurcation point, then F(g,m) is degenerate at (qo,mo). Con-
versely, it is not always true.

When we study central configuration, due to symmetry coming from the invariance of
the equation (7) of central configuration with respect to translation, rotation and scaling, the
degeneracy of the map defined by the left hand side of (3) is unavoidable.

Equivalently we can study the symmetry from the point of view of mappings. We define
the diagonal SO(2)-action on RY x R™ and R® by

SO(2) x (RY x R”) = RY x R™ (A, (q,m)) 6 (Aq),

and
SO(2) x RY + RY, (4,q) > Ag.

Then the mapping F(q,m) is SO(2) rotation equivariant. However, when we restrict to
central configuration (i.e., the level surface F = 0, it is rotation invariant), so the rotation
symmetry is always there.

Since the allowed symmetries depend on the concrete form of the equations of central
configurations, we give all the possibilities for completeness. (1) fixing center of mass, due to
rotation and scaling invariance we have two trivial zeros (§3.2); (2) killing scaling, we have
three zeros due to translation and rotation invariance (§3.3); (3) if we keep all symmetry, we
have four zeros (§3.4).

Remark 3.2. When we talk about the degeneracy of a solution to a system of equations
which possesses symmetries like the case at hand about the central configurations, we can
only define the nondegeneracy modulus the symmetries. We will give the precise definitions
in the following sections.
3.2 Form I: Two Trivial Zero Eigenvalues

It is convenient to work with the equivalent form of a central configuration, namely as a
critical point of JIU, with potential

Then, the equations for a central configuration are given by

which is equivalent to

jaja inal I

The system (lip: F(q,m) = [F:(q,m)|" = 0 is invariant under rotation and scaling about
a central configuration go for mo, but not for translation because the center of mass is fixed
at the origin.

For the rotation invariance as did in (p50), let A be a family of rotation matrices

w= [0 A Jesoe
and Aa
Aq= A |

where

Aqi = Alxi,yil" = ci oath | | ' | ,

From the rotation equivariance,

F(A(t)q,m) =A(t)F(q,m) for allt eR.

Taking derivative on both sides with respect to t, we obtain

PAA) — s00(F)|GarngmA'(O4= A (OF (QM)

Evaluating at a central configuration qo for mass mo with t = 0, we have
dF (A(t)qo,mo)
dt

This shows that the Jacobian matrix Jac(F)
sponding eigenvector A’(0)qo

|1=0 = Jac(F’)| (qg,mg) (A’(0)qo) = A"(0)F (go,mo) = 0.

Concerning the scaling invariance of F’, in fact, we have

F(tq,m) = pF lam) for all t > 0.

Taking differentials on both sides with respect to ¢ and applying the chain rule, we obtain

dF (tq,m 1

Evaluating at go, mo, t = 1, we get
dF (tqo,mo)
|. = Jae(F)\(go.mo)40 = —F (go,mo) = 0.
t=1

Thus, the central configuration vector itself is an eigenvector corresponding to the zero eigen-
value.

We summarize our results in the following proposition.

Proposition 3.3. Let qo be a central configuration of mo defined by equation (I). Let

Definition 3.4 (Nondegeneracy of a Central Configuration (Form ])). A central configura-
tion go for mo is said to be nondegenerate if detJ2 4 0 in Proposition [3.3] Otherwise, it is
considered to be degenerate.

Remark 3.13. When studying the linear stability of the elliptic relative equilibria in the planar

the phase space of the planar N-body problem. Here we work on the configuration space,
the above statement is basically the same as the restriction to the configuration space of their
result. See also [8].

3.5  Non-degeneracy of Lagrange Central Configurations

In 1772, Lagrange [9] discovered that equilateral triangles form central configurations for
any three positive masses m,,m2,m3, and further proved that these are the only non-collinear
central configurations in the three-body problem. While the uniqueness of the equilateral tri-
angle configuration is well-known, the non-degeneracy of Lagrange’s solutions for arbitrary
masses is not immediately obvious. In this subsection, we rederive this property using the
framework of Proposition 3.12]

Proposition 3.16. The central configurations of the Lagrange equilateral triangle qo =

[1 ,0,-— A, vee — ys - ¥] are non-degenerate for any three positive masses mo = {m,m2,m3}.

Therefore det(J2) = 4 (mp2 +mym3 +m2m3) is not zero for any positive masses. This
confirms that Lagrange central configurations are nondegenerate.

4 Non-degeneracy of Rhombus Central Configurations of
4-body Problem

As proved in [L1], two pairs of equal masses can form a unique convex central configuration
in rhombus shape. The existence of rhombus central configurations was established in [4]
(Lemma 4). In this subsection, we establish further its non-degeneracy using the framework

of Proposition

Theorem 4.1. For any positive mass m, > 0, there exists a unique rhombus-shaped central

3
configuration qo = [0,a,—1,0,0, —a,1,0] where a € & ¥3) , corresponding to the mass

vector mo = |m,,1,m, 1]. Moreover, all such rhombus central configurations are nondegen-
erate for any four positive masses mo = [m,,1,m1, 1].

Proof. The existence is already known in [4] which we include here for completeness. First
let us investigate the relations between m, and a. Substituting go and mo into the equations
of central configurations (14), we obtain two equations:

4 m4
(15) f “a ma Batata,
 (@41)2 4(a2)? 2am +2

20
and

4 mod
2m 1 yet tayet2
(16) fo 5 5 =0.
(a2 +1)? 4 2a*m, +2

Noticing that a* f,, — fo = 0 and directly solving one of the above equations, we have:

m
a (+ 1)2 -8)

(17) m= 5
(a2 +1)? —8a3

One would expect the other way around, however it is hard to get an explicit formula if it is
not impossible. By simple analysis, equation gives us

* Forae€ (0, 8), m <0.
¢ Foraeé eee /3),m > 0, and my is strictly decreasing.

* For a € (V3,0),m <0.

° ntl m, = +c0 and lim, 371 =),

Therefore, for any positive mass m, > 0, there is a unique rhombus shape central configura-
tion with the unique value a € (, 3). Now let us use the framework of Proposition
to prove the nondegeneracy of such cental configurations.

With the given go and mo,

Figure 2: The graph shows that the determinant of J2 is positive for a € (2, V3), which
means that the rhombus central configurations are nondegenerate.

We can numerically compute the value det(J2) for given a € ex V3).
For example det(J2)(1) + 4.4064 > 0. Figure[2|suggests that the determinant of J2 is positive

foraeé G2, V3), which means that the rhombus central configurations are nondegenerate.

It is not feasible to prove analytically that the determinant of J> is positive over the entire
domain a € (32, V3), despite its explicit expression being easily obtainable. We therefore
employ interval arithmetic to rigorously prove the positivity of det(J2). This approach is jus-
tified by the fundamental theorem of interval arithmetic [20] 22) [25]. The interval arithmetic
evaluation f([x]) of a function f over an interval [x] provides an inclusion interval extension
of the range R(f; [x]); that is,

R(fs[x]) S f(b).
We implement the interval arithmetic computations using SageMath 10.5. For example,
for the function f(x) =x? —2x+1, we have f([—2,2]) = [3,9] while the true range is
R(f;[—2,2]) = [0,9], confirming that R(f;[—2,2]) C f([—2,2]). This inclusion property is
the foundation of all applications of interval arithmetic and, consequently, the basis for its
use in our proposed method below.

Since m; approaches +o as a approaches va we have to divide the interval computation

24
into two parts.

The interval [V3/3 +0.1, V3 +0.01] is divided into 1000 equal small intervals. The
determinant of Jz is always positive on these small intervals. Similarly, we can further
prove that The determinant of J) is positive on [V3/3 + 0.0001, V3 + 0.1]

We cannot directly evaluate the determinant on the small interval [\/3/3,/3/3 +
0.0001] because my is undefined at the left endpoint. First note that m, is decreas-
ing on (V3/3, V3/3+0.0001] and m, > 2072. Here we treat m) as a parameter in the
expression of det(J2) and

G= (a?m, + 1)* det(J2) = gs(a)m§ +g7(a)m) +++-+81(a)m + go(a).

Ata=V3/3,

G = 0.237130883 — 4.337250275m, + 0.24968673 1mt +41 .02060288m?

+1.744273435m] + 0.1001129150m%
which is positive for any m, > 1.
Now applying interval computation on the interval [/3/3, /3/3 +.0.0001],
G = [0.23210355956589200407097272, 0.24105527338835583080436715]

where only the coefficient of linear term my is negative. It is clear that G is positive for
all m, > 2072. Therefore, det(J2) is positive on the interval (\/3/3, /3/3 +.0.0001],

This completes the proof that det(J2) is positive on (\/3/3, V3) and all the rhombus central
configurations are nondengenrate.

5 Conclusion

When studying degeneracy of central configurations with bifurcation bearing in mind, we
emphasize to work directly with the full configuration space from the computer-aided com-
putations perspectives. By developing a systematic methods to eliminate trivial zero eigen-
values due to the invariance of translation, rotation and scaling, we provide a unified frame-
work for analyzing the Jacobian matrix. This allows for a precise characterization of degen-
eracy, distinguishing it from the effects of those symmetries.

The three distinct formulations of degeneracy of central configurations presented here
offer flexibility in handling different scenarios, enhancing the toolkit for studying central
configurations. Applications to classical examples, such as the square configuration and
the equilateral triangle with a central mass, not only validate the method but also uncover
the known critical mass thresholds where degeneracy emerges. In particular, the analysis
reaffirms the non-degeneracy of Lagrange’s equilateral triangle central configurations for
any mass.

These investigations facilitate and pave the way to explore the degeneracy of central
configurations, especially their bifurcations in the full configuration space, which is our next
topic.
