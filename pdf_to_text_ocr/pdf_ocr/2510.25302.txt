ABSTRACT

Planetary rings are not only ubiquitous around the giant planets in the outer Solar System, but have
also been discovered around several small distant bodies. In contrast, no rings have been observed
around any inner Solar System objects. To constrain the dynamical origin of this ringed-versus-
ringless dichotomy, we employ a numerically cross-checked analytical model of gigayear-scale Poynting-
Robertson (PR) drag due to the solar flux acting on an isolated particle, expressed as a function of the
host body’s heliocentric distance apja and the particle radius rpar. Here we show that, in the absence
of additional perturbations, PR drag alone can explain the observed ring architecture of the Solar
System: outer planets and Centaurs/TNOs are able to retain rings for the age of the Solar System,
whereas any rings around the inner planets are removed on much shorter timescales. Because the PR-
drag lifetime scales steeply with heliocentric distance (Fawexy loa Qa ifpan)' we predict that forthcoming
surveys will reveal an ever-growing population of ring-bearing bodies in the distant Solar System.

1. INTRODUCTION

Planetary rings are among the most striking — but also the most selective — features in the Solar System. Although
a variety of mechanisms can generate rings, only a fraction of planetary bodies are actually observed to host them.
As discussed below, a ringed-versus-ringless dichotomy appears to exist between the inner and outer Solar System.
Understanding why rings persist around some objects but not others therefore remains a fundamental problem in
planetary science.

One well-studied ring formation pathway around terrestrial planets in the inner Solar System is collisional. During
the final stages of terrestrial planet formation, giant impacts inevitably eject debris that can be gravitationally captured
by the surviving body (W. K. Hartmann & D. R. Davis 1975). The canonical Earth-Moon-forming impact (e.g., R. M.
Canup 2004; E. Kokubo et al. 2000) and the putative giant impact that produced Phobos and Deimos (e.g., R.
Hyodo et al. 2017b; P. Rosenblatt et al. 2016) have been studied in terms of the dynamical evolution of the resulting
planetocentric debris: each would have left an optically thin particulate ring once satellite accretion was complete.
Yet no such rings are seen around Earth or Mars today (M. R. Showalter et al. 2006). Similarly, Mercury and Venus
lack both moons and rings — perhaps because their impacts never produced disks/rings massive enough to form
satellites, or because any satellites were later removed by tidal interactions (K. Atobe & S. Ida 2007). Even smaller-
scale impacts can in principle create transient debris rings, but none of the present-day terrestrial planets and small

inner solar system bodies exhibit ring systems.

Various formation mechanisms have been proposed to explain the rings observed around bodies in the outer Solar
System. For example, close encounters between a giant planet and a passing large body can tidally strip material from
a passing body, seeding a ring around the planet (L. Dones 1991; R. Hyodo et al. 2017a). Meanwhile, the remaining
large body can gravitationally capture part of its own debris to acquire a ring of its own (R. Hyodo et al. 2016). This
is just one example of ring formation, but such processes demonstrate that rings are not confined to massive planets
in the outer Solar System. Indeed, at the time of this paper is written, particulate rings are confirmed or suspected
around several small outer solar system bodies through observing stellar occultations — including the Centaur Chariklo
(F. Braga-Ribas et al. 2014), possibly Chiron (J. L. Ortiz et al. 2015), the dwarf planet Haumea (J. L. Ortiz et al.
2017), and the trans-Neptunian object Quaoar (B. E. Morgado et al. 2023; C. Pereira et al. 2023). Statistical estimates

suggest that rings occur around roughly 8 — 12% of small outer solar system bodies (B. Sicardy et al. 2020), implying
that additional ring-bearing objects will likely be discovered.

Indeed, the aforementioned ring-forming processes could operate in both the inner and outer Solar System; however,
observations clearly indicate that rings are more prevalent in the outer Solar System. Whether produced by impacts,
tidal encounters, or other processes, the ultimate survival of a ring depends on the dynamical evolution of its constituent
particles. Accordingly, this evolution should be consistent with the observed ringed-versus-ringless dichotomy between
the inner and outer Solar System.

The evolution of ring particles is governed by several distinct physical regimes. When a ring is optically thick,
collisional and gravitational interactions among the particles can dominate, leading to viscous spreading (D. Lynden-
Bell & A. Kalnajs 1972; P. Goldreich & S. Tremaine 1978). As an alternative, when the central body’s shape is
non-axisymmetric, resonant effects arise between the object’s spin rate and the ring particles’ mean motion (B. Sicardy
et al. 2020).

Here we instead consider the optically thin limit and follow the dynamics of individual, isolated particles around a
spherical central body due to non-gravitational forces. The dominant non-gravitational force on a ring particle depends

on its size. Here we focus on ”medium-sized” particles — typically centimeter- to meter-sized — which we assume are
neither rapidly removed by solar radiation pressure, taking into account the planetary shadow (Y. Liang & R. Hyodo
2023), nor strongly affected by Yarkovsky or YORP effects (D. P. Rubincam 2000). In this size regime, Poynting-
Robertson (PR) drag due to the solar flux may dominate the non-gravitational evolution, gradually removing orbital
energy and leading to a contraction of the semimajor axis (see also J. A. Burns et al. 2001). Note that if the planetary
shadow is neglected, solar PR drag produces no secular change in eccentricity (J. A. Burns et al. 1979); to the best of
my knowledge, the giga-year scale long-term effect of the shadow on eccentricity has not yet been investigated.

Previous studies (e.g., J. A. Burns et al. 1979) carried out an extensive analytical study of Poynting-Robertson drag,
but at that time rings had not yet been discovered around the wide range of body sizes and orbital radii we know
today. Consequently, the theory could neither fully account for observational data nor be tightly constrained by it.
In this present work, we revisit the problem in light of new observations to reassess the potential role of PR-drag in
shaping the distribution of rings throughout the solar system.

2. METHODS

In this section we describe the methodology of our numerical simulations. We concentrate exclusively on Poynting-
Robertson (PR) drag due to the solar flux. To isolate the role of PR drag, we adopt a deliberately simplified approach.
We assume that an isolated ring particle is present at around a spherical host body and then follow its dynamical
evolution over gigayear timescales. Our results are presented as functions of particle size rpar and the radial distance of
the central body from the Sun apia, providing a baseline for assessing which rings can plausibly persist to the present
day and which are destined to vanish on shorter timescales.

A direct, first-principles integration of the PR-drag force over gigayear timescales is computationally prohibitive,
so we adopt instead the analytical prescription recently developed by Y. Liang & R. Hyodo (2023). Using classical
planetary perturbation theory (C. D. Murray & S. F. Dermott 1999) together with the canonical formulation of PR
drag (J. A. Burns et al. 1979), Y. Liang & R. Hyodo (2023) (their Eq. (20)) derived an expression for the lowest
secular decay rate of a particle’s semimajor axis about a spherical central body, whether a planet or a small object,
on a circular orbit:

where par is the particle’s semimajor axis; definitions of all other variables appearing in the expression are summarized
in Table 1. This newly derived equation explicitly incorporates the angular extent of the planetary shadow, 2¢ (see
Fig. 1 in Y. Liang & R. Hyodo 2023), as well as the effects of particle inclination i and planetary obliquity e.
3

Here, lowest signifies that Eq. 1 is derived under the assumption of a particle’s circular orbit (e = 0). In reality,
perturbations can excite a finite eccentricity, so that a particle’s pericentre lies inside its semimajor axis; therefore,
the resulting smaller pericentre distance makes it easier for the particle to collide with the planet. Direct numerical
integrations that incorporate the planetary shadow, planetary oblateness Jj, solar radiation pressure, and the solar
Poynting-Robertson drag show that a particle’s orbit becomes non-circular and the decay rate given by Eq. | is indeed
a lower bound on the orbital evolution toward impact with the central body (Y. Liang & R. Hyodo 2023).

The actual lifetime before collision with the host planetary body depends on the attained eccentricity, because the
pericentre distance is g = a(1 —e). For particles that start on circular orbits, larger objects are less susceptible to
eccentricity growth driven by non-gravitational forces than smaller ones; consequently, their lifetimes more closely
approach the lower bound estimate of Eq. 1, and vice versa (Y. Liang & R. Hyodo 2023).

In this study, using the above equation, we examine how planetary parameters — specifically the planet’s heliocentric
distance and mass — and particle size affect the PR-drag lifetime of circumplanetary particles. Quantifying these
dependencies is the primary objective of this study, and we also discuss which bodies in the Solar System could host
rings.

3. RESULTS: RINGED VS. RINGLESS WORLDS

Figure 1 illustrates the time evolution of the particle’s semimajor axis dpar for selected different host planetary bodies.
Poynting-Robertson drag removes angular momentum from an orbit around a central body, causing the particle to
spiral inward. As expected, particles that orbit host bodies located farther from the Sun, as well as particles with
larger radii, survive for longer periods before ultimately colliding with the central body. In the figure, each particle is
initially placed at 5Rpia, where Rp}, denotes the radius of the central body. For comparison, the Roche limit for Earth
and Mars is ~ 3Rpia. Particles that begin at smaller orbital distances collide with the central body on correspondingly
shorter timescales.

The characteristic timescale for PR-drag-induced decay of a particle’s semimajor axis Tgecay can be written as

This expression is obtained directly from Eq. 1. In the derivation we neglect the multiplicative factor enclosed in the

arge square brackets, [-- ‘|; in Eq. 1. Over the allowed parameter ranges, this factor varies between ~ 0.46 and 1.5
— attaining the maximum for i ~ 0, « ~ 0, ¢ = 0, and the minimum for i ~ 7/2, € ~ 0, cos2¢ = —3/4. The square
racketed factor in Eq. 1 accounts for particle inclination i, planetary obliquity ¢, and the length of the planetary
shadow 2¢. While omitting this bracketed factor changes the result only by an order-unity factor and is acceptable for
the order-of-magnitude estimates intended here, including it yields a coefficient consistent with the earlier expressions
of J. A. Burns et al. (1979) and P. Goldreich & S. Tremaine (1982), which did not consider planetary obliquity and
lanetary shadow.
Note that Tdecay is independent of the particle’s initial circumplanetary distance a,,,,9 when the term in the square
rackets (Eq. 1) has been approximated as unity. From Gauss’s form of Lagrange’s planetary equations, da/dt =

Consequently, particles that begin farther out (apar larger, Mpar smaller) experience a larger absolute semimajor-axis

that orbit a planetary body farther from the Sun (apia large) survive longest. The plot shows that gigayear-scale
inward migration driven by Poynting-Robertson drag introduces a natural division in the solar system with regard to
ring lifetimes: outer planetary bodies can retain rings, whereas inner planetary bodies lose them, consistent with the
ringed-vs.-ringless pattern observed in the Solar System. We note that although the dimensionless radiation-pressure
efficiency factor Q sets the absolute scale of Taecay, reasonable variations in Q would not alter the global bimodal
architecture of ringed versus ringless worlds.

4. DISCUSSION

On the basis of the parameter space shown in Fig. 2, we may place new constraints on the formation and evo-
lutionary history of the Solar System and predict the most promising locations for yet-undiscovered ringed worlds
that future, higher-sensitivity observations may reveal. We emphasize that Fig. 2 is intended as a general framework
rather than being tied to any specific particle size. However, some observational constraints on ring particle sizes
have been obtained for several planetary ring systems (e.g., J. A. Burns et al. 2001; M. S. Tiscareno & C. D. Murray
2018). For example, the typical sizes of particles in Saturn’s dense rings are estimated to range from millimeters to
meters (e.g., R. G. Jerousek et al. 2020), and the particles in Uranus’ dense rings are likely of comparable size (L.
Esposito et al. 1991). In contrast, for fainter and more tenuous rings such as those around Jupiter and Neptune, the
characteristic particle sizes are typically in the range of 1 — 100 microns and these small particles are continuously
replenished by ejecta from nearby moons generated by micrometeoroid impacts (e.g., I. De Pater et al. 2018). As

future observations better constrain the typical particle sizes in different ring systems, or as readers adopt their own
preferred values, our parameter-space maps can be directly applied to obtain the corresponding decay timescales and
associated implications. Below, we provide some illustrative examples.

4.1. Constraints on the Giant-Impact Origin of Satellite Formation

Giant impacts are widely regarded as a common outcome of the final stages of planetary accretion (J. Chambers &
G. Wetherill 1998; C. B. Agnor et al. 1999). In the canonical scenarios proposed for the formation of Earth’s Moon
6

(R. M. Canup 2004) and Mars’s moons (R. Hyodo et al. 2017b), such collisions generate a debris disk that subsequently
spreads beyond the planet’s Roche limit, allowing a satellite to accrete from the disk material (E. Kokubo et al. 2000;
P. Rosenblatt et al. 2016; A. J. Hesselbrock & D. A. Minton 2017). Once the disks viscously spread and a moon

system has formed, the residual disk becomes highly optically

ed for e.g., viscous spreading (A. Crida et al. 2025).
H. Durisen 2023) may play an important role in the

further dynamical evolution of optically thin disks, although it has not been proven that this process can completely

remove the disk to be consistent with observations.

Giant impacts are thought to have occurred approximately 4 Gyr ago, during the late stages of planetary accretion

(e.g., E. V. Quintana et al. 2016). The proposed debris disk p:

roduced around Earth or Mars would have viscously

spread in orders of magnitude shorter than the billions of years (E. Kokubo et al. 2000; P. Rosenblatt et al. 2016).
An optically thin particulate ring — composed of dynamically isolated particles — could therefore, in principle, have

persisted for gigayears, yet no such remnant is observed today.
Figure 2 indicates that cumulative Poynting-Robertson drag

can indeed remove the residual particle on gigayear

timescales as long as the particle size is smaller than ~ 0.1 m, Therefore, to support the classical giant-impact origin of
the Moon and the Martian satellites, future independent studies should investigate the characteristic size distribution
of particles produced by giant-impact-generated debris disks during their subsequent spreading phase.

In contrast to the classical hypothesis, an alternative ring-satellite recycling scenario (A. J. Hesselbrock & D. A.
Minton 2017) suggests that Phobos is the latest survivor of several generations of satellites formed and disrupted only

should still be detectable around Mars.

Venus and Mercury likely experienced giant impacts as well. Although the absence of satellites around these planets
is beyond the scope of the present study', any resulting optically thin particulate disks would be even more susceptible
to cumulative solar Poynting-Robertson drag, and could be cleared away on relatively short timescales even if the

constituent particles were comparatively large (Fig. 2).

Indeed, all giant planets have rings. Furthermore, this expecta

rings around several Centaurs (e.g., F. Braga-Ribas et al. 2014; J. L. Ortiz et al. 2015) and trans-Neptunian objects

(eg.,

J. L. Ortiz et al. 2017; B. E. Morgado et al. 2023; C. Pereira et al. 2023). We anticipate that an ever-increasing

number of ring-bearing bodies will be discovered in the outer Solar System.

By the same argument, some Jupiter’s Trojan asteroids may

could have ejected debris that now persists as a transient particulate ring around the parent body. Based on the results

shown in Fig. 2, for example, we can expect that icy/rocky part

icles of ~ 1 cm in size can survive for billions of years,

1K. Atobe & S. Ida (2007) demonstrated that when the semi-major axis of a planet is small, the angular momentum of the satellite’s
orbit can be stripped away by solar tides, causing it to fall toward the planet.

whereas particles of ~ 1mm in size can persist for about 100 million years. NASA’s Lucy mission will begin its tour
of the Trojan swarms in 2027 and will provide a critical test of this prediction (H. F. Levison et al. 2021).

Finally, ring particles can be generated at any epoch — whether by impacts, tidal disruptions, rotational break-up,
or other processes. Here an important point is that the size-frequency distribution typically has a negative slope,
producing many small fragments and only a few large ones (e.g., J. Dohnanyi 1969; J. Colwell 1996). Smaller par-
ticles are removed on correspondingly shorter timescales: micron- to millimetre-sized grains are cleared not only by
the Poynting-Robertson drag considered here but also by radiation pressure, electromagnetic forces, and collisional
grinding (J. A. Burns et al. 1979). Conversely, decimetre- to metre-scale and larger objects can survive in orbit
for much longer intervals, yet their relative scarcity makes any associated ring system intrinsically difficult to de-
tect. Therefore, considering the above arguments, observational biases — particularly in the outer Solar System —
likely contribute to the underrepresentation of ringed bodies, and additional ring-bearing objects may yet be discovered.

5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES

We have mapped the solar Poynting-Robertson drag lifetime (Taecay; Eq. 4) of particles orbiting a central body —
whether a planet, dwarf planet, asteroid, or other small bodies — as a function of the host body’s heliocentric distance
and the particle radius. The scaling Taecay « a2 147 par can naturally explain the Solar System’s ringed-versus-ringless
dichotomy: outer planets and several distant small bodies can retain rings for gigayears, whereas inner planets lose
them on much shorter timescales.

PR drag is only one of several non-gravitational forces, and particles smaller than those considered in this study are
more susceptible to other perturbations. Additional perturbations — such as collisional grinding, tidal or shepherding
moon torques, electromagnetic forces, the asymmetric gravitational potential of the central body, and resonant inter-

actions — can further, or in some circumstances even predominantly, modify ring lifetimes across different systems.
Furthermore, recycling between rings and moons can occur (A. J. Hesselbrock & D. A. Minton 2019), and the age of a
ring’s initial formation does not necessarily correspond to the ages inferred from other contexts — such as its exposure
age, structural age, dynamical age, or erosion age — that we observe today (P. R. Estrada & R. H. Durisen 2023; S.
Kempf et al. 2023; R. Hyodo et al. 2025). The detailed discussion of these broader issues is beyond the scope of this
paper; however, we refer interested readers to a recent review (A. Crida et al. 2025).

We proposed that applying the PR drag framework may place quantitative constraints on planetary formation and
evolution. For instance, any debris left by the impacts that produced the Moon or the Martian satellites may have
consisted predominantly of sub-metre fragments in order to be removed within ~ 4 Gyr. Because Taecay increases
rapidly with heliocentric distance, we predict that additional ring-bearing objects await discovery in the outer Solar
System, with the Jupiter-Trojan population providing an imminent observational test as NASA’s Lucy mission ap-
proaches its targets.
