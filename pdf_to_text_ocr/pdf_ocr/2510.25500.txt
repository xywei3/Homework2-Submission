ABSTRACT

Context. The astrophysical origin of the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process), responsible for producing roughly half of the
elements heavier than iron, remains uncertain. Detailed chemical signatures from the oldest, most metal-poor stars, which act as fossil
records of the earliest nucleosynthesis events, can be used to identify the dominant r-process sites.

Aims. We present a homogeneous chemical abundance analysis of ten r-process element-enhanced stars. These old and metal-poor
stars are strongly enriched in r-process elements with minimal contamination from other nucleosynthetic sources. By focusing on this
chemically pure sample, we aim to investigate intrinsic variations in the r-process abundance patterns and explore their implications
for the nature and potential diversity of r-process sites.

Methods. We performed a detailed chemical abundance analysis of high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra. For each star, we
inspected over 1400 individual absorption lines using a combination of equivalent width measurements and spectral synthesis. The
analysis was conducted under the assumption of one-dimensional local thermodynamic equilibrium, employing the MOOG radiative
transfer code.

Results. We derived abundances for 54 chemical species, including 29 neutron-capture (n-capture) elements covering the full mass
range of the r-process abundance pattern. A kinematic analysis reveals that stars likely originated from ten kinematically distinct
systems. Based on this assumption, we use the sample to probe the maximum variation expected from ten independent r-process
nucleosynthesis events and compute the intrinsic dispersion of each element relative to Zr and Eu, for the light and heavy r-process
elements, respectively. This exercise results in a remarkably low cosmic scatter across the ten r-process sites enriching these stars, for

the rare earth and third peak elements, for example, we find O.a/zy) = 0.08 and o{os/zuj = 0.11 dex while the scatter between light

and heavy, o{zrzu is slightly higher at 0.18 dex.

Conclusions. The elemental abundance patterns across the ten independent r-proce:

ites show remarkably small cosmic dispersions.

This minimal dispersion suggests a high degree of uniformity in r-process yields across diverse astrophysical environments.

1. Introduction

The heaviest elements of the periodic table, those beyond the
iron peak (Z 2 30), are primarily synthesized through neutron-
capture processes during stellar evolution and explosive astro-
physical events. Among these, the rapid neutron-capture process
(r-process) is a dominant mechanism for producing half of the
isotopes and, in particular, the actinide elements thorium and

scopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile and data taken at

uranium. The r-process occurs under extreme conditions of high
neutron densities (10?° — 1078 n/em?) (Kratz et al. 2007) and
short timescales (Burbidge et al. 1957; Cameron 1957), allow-
ing atomic nuclei to rapidly capture neutrons before undergo-
ing B-decay. Despite considerable investigations, the astrophys-
ical sites of the r-process remain an area of active investiga-
tion. Compact binary mergers, including both binary neutron star
mergers (NSM) and neutron star-black hole systems, have long
been proposed as prime candidates (Lattimer & Schramm 1974;
Eichler et al. 2015). The detection of the gravitational wave event

kilonova having emission consistent with the decay of heavy el-
ement isotopes (Chornock et al. 2017; Villar et al. 2017; Drout
et al. 2017), provided the first direct observational support for
this scenario. Although NSMs are currently the leading candi-
dates for the origin of r-process elements, their contribution to
Galactic chemical enrichment is still debated (Tsujimoto, T. &
Shigeyama, T. 2014; Coté et al. 2019a; Skiiladottir & Salvadori
2020; Vanbeveren & Mennekens 2024). Factors such as merger
rates, delay times, and the sensitivity of nucleosynthetic yields to
system properties (e.g., neutron star mass) introduce uncertain-
ties that are not yet fully captured in current chemical evolution
models (Holmbeck & Andrews 2024; van de Voort et al. 2020,
2022). On top of that, multiple recent studies demonstrated that
at least two r-process sites are required to explain the observed
r-process elements abundances in metal-poor stars (Cété et al.
2019b; Molero et al. 2023; Kuske et al. 2025). For these reasons,
alternative sites for r-process nucleosynthesis have been pro-
posed in addition to NSMs, these include magneto-rotationally
supernovae (Nishimura et al. 2006; Winteler et al. 2012; Cowan
et al. 2021; Prasanna et al. 2024), collapsars (Barnes & Met-
zger 2022), common-envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) (Grich-
ener et al. 2022; Jin & Soker 2024; Soker 2025) and the neutrino-
driven wind emerging from the proto-neutron star in the after-
math of the explosion (Arcones & Thielemann 2012; Wang &
Burrows 2023). For the latter, however, simulations have shown
that under typical conditions, these winds tend to produce only
a weak or limited r-process, insufficient for forming the heaviest
elements. Additionally, certain classes of massive, fast-rotating,
and highly magnetized stars, which lead to magnetars (Patel et al.
2025), magnetohydrodynamic-jet supernovae, or black hole ac-
cretion disks (Siegel et al. 2019), are considered potential r-
process sites (Halevi & Mésta 2018). In these scenarios, the r-
process could occur in the ejecta from the central object, such as
a neutron star or black hole.

Accurately derived elemental abundances from old metal-
poor stars can be used as an observational constraint for nucle-
osynthesis models and helps trace the chemical evolution of stars
and galaxies (Sneden et al. 2008; Cescutti et al. 2022). However,
the detailed determination of elemental abundances in metal-
poor stars is challenging and strongly depends on the underlying
assumptions of stellar atmosphere and radiative transfer mod-
els. The most physically realistic models, those incorporating
three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamics (e.g., Rodriguez Diaz
et al. 2024) and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE)
effects, better capture stellar surface inhomogeneities and ra-
diative imbalances (for a detailed review of 3D-NLTE effects
in late-type stars, see Lind & Amarsi 2024). Yet, such models
are not broadly available across the full range of stellar param-
eters required for the stars of interest in this kind of study, in
which we analyze old, relatively cool (< 5500 K) metal-poor
red giants. In addition, atomic data for the development of model
atoms for the heaviest elements remains sparse, further compli-
cating accurate abundance determinations. For this reason, most
of the abundances present in literature and in this work are deter-
mined under the assumption of 1D-LTE. However, despite these
challenges, homogeneous abundance analyzes remain a power-
ful tool for minimizing systematic uncertainties and identifying
meaningful trends in abundances, especially for stars with simi-
lar stellar parameters.

In this work, we present a homogeneous chemical analy-
sis of ten r-process enhanced stars with [Eu/Fe] > +0.3 and
[Ba/Eu] < —0.5. These stars were discovered by the R-Process

Alliance (RPA)! (Hansen et al. 2018) through their successful
search for r-process enriched stars (Sakari et al. 2018; Ezzeddine
et al. 2020; Holmbeck et al. 2020; Bandyopadhyay et al. 2024).
With this sample, we investigate the cosmic spread among ten
r-process production sites that contributed to the enrichment of
these stars.

This paper is outlined as follows: Information about the ob-
servations is presented in Section 2. The derivation of the stel-
lar parameters and the details about the abundance analysis are
described in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. The results are pre-
sented in Section 5 and discussed in Section 6. A summary is
provided in Section 7.

2. Data

The ten stars analyzed in this paper are presented in Table 1,
which lists the 2MASS identifier, right ascension (R.A.), dec-
lination (Decl.), photometric data (V, G and K magnitudes,
and BP and RP colors), color excess (E(B — V)) and paral-
lax (@). For brevity, we adopt shortened source names con-
structed from the first four digits of the right ascension and
the first four digits of the declination (including the sign), e.g.,
J00401252+2729247 becomes J0040+2729. These abbreviated
names are used throughout the text and in the following tables.
All ten stars were observed as part of the RPA "snapshot" sur-
vey, which uses relatively short, moderate signal-to-noise ra-
tios (SNR ~ 30 at 4100 A) high-resolution spectroscopy (R ~
30, 000) to efficiently identify r-process enhanced stars (Hansen
et al. 2018). During this initial screening, a set of key ele-
mental abundances (specifically [Fe/H], [C/Fe], [Sr/Fe], [Ba/Fe],
[Eu/Fe], [Ba/Eu], and [Sr/Ba]) are determined to categorize the
stars. This approach allows the collaboration to quickly select
promising targets for more detailed study. Eight of the stars an-
alyzed here were discovered in the first data release from the
RPA (Hansen et al. 2018). Snapshot spectra for the remaining
two stars, J0040+2729 and JO217—1903, will be included in the
forthcoming sixth RPA data release (T.T. Hansen et al., in prep).

Following this, all of them were selected for follow-up ob-
servations, having an [Eu/Fe] > 0.3 and [Ba/Fe] < 0.0. High-
resolution, high signal-to-noise “portrait” spectra were obtained
between May 2017 and July 2018 using the Magellan Inamori
Kyocera Echelle (MIKE) spectrograph (Bernstein et al. 2003) on
the Landon Clay (Magellan II) telescope at Las Campanas Ob-
servatory, Chile. The only exception is J0040+2729, which was
observed in August 2020 with the TS23 echelle spectrograph
(Suntzeff 1995) on the Harlan J. Smith 107-inch (2.7 m) tele-
scope at McDonald Observatory. The higher SNR and resolu-
tion of the portrait observations facilitate a more detailed chem-
ical abundance analysis of the identified r-process enhanced
stars. The MIKE spectra cover a wavelength range of 3350 Ato
5000 Ain the blue and 4900 Ato 9500 Ain the red. The observa-
tions were taken with the 0.35” x 5.00” slit using 2 x 2 binning
and the 0.50” x 5.00” slit using 2 x 1 binning. The correspond-
ing resolving powers are R ~ 56,000 and R ~ 54,000 in the
blue, and R ~ 50,000 and R ~ 48,000 in the red, respectively.
The TS23 echelle spectrograph provides spectral coverage from
3400 A to 10,900 A, with a resolving power of R ~ 43,000 when
using the 1.8” x 8.00” slit and 1 x 1 binning. Table 2 summarizes
the observing log, including the instrument setup (slit size and
binning), exposure times, and SNR for each target.

Notes. For the stars J0217—1903 and J1432—4125, multiple observations were taken at different epochs. These spectra were corrected for radial
velocity shifts and subsequently coadded. We report the SNR of the final coadded spectrum only, as it is the version used for the analysis.

2.1. Data reduction

The MIKE data were reduced using the Carnegie Python (CarPy)
pipeline (Kelson et al. 2000; Kelson 2003) and the TS23 echelle
data was reduced using standard IRAF? packages (Tody 1986,
1993; Fitzpatrick et al. 2024). The data reduction process in-
cluded corrections for bias, flat-fielding, and scattered light. For
stars observed across multiple nights, the individual spectra were
co-added.

2.2. Radial velocities

To determine the heliocentric radial velocity (RVhelio) Values, we
performed an order-by-order cross-correlation using the IRAF’s
task fxcor*. The cross-correlation was carried out on 20 spec-
tral orders centered around the Mg I triplet region, and the re-
sulting velocity shift was then applied to all remaining orders.

Center at NSF NOIRLab, which is managed by the Association of Uni-
versities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) under a cooperative agree-
ment with the U.S. National Science Foundation.

The standard stars used for calibration were HD 182488, with a
heliocentric velocity of Vpelio = 81.97 km s“!, observed with the
McD setup, and HD 211038 (Vnelio = 10.44 km s!) together with
HD 122563 (Vietio = —26.13 kms~!), observed with the MIKE
setup using slit widths of 0.50” and 0.35’, respectively. Final
values presented in Table 2 are taken as the mean and standard
deviation of the orders used for the cross-correlation. All the ra-
dial velocities are consistent with the values found by Hansen
et al. (2018) and by GaiaDR3 Gaia Collaboration et al. (2023a),
except for J1916—5544. For this star, we measure +49.43 + 0.17
km s“!, in contrast to literature values of +46.58 + 0.29 km s~!
(Hansen et al. 2018) and +46.90 + 0.30 km s~! (Gaia Collabora-
tion et al. 2023b), suggesting the star belongs to a binary system.

3. Stellar parameter determination

Stellar parameters were derived using the methodology estab-
lished by the RPA (see Roederer et al. 2018; Shah et al. 2024;
Xylakis-Dornbusch et al. 2024 for details). A short overview is
provided below. Effective temperatures (T.) were determined
photometrically using Gaia G, BP, RP-bands and 2MASS K-
band magnitudes, listed in Table 1. We adopted the color—
metallicity—T calibrations from Mucciarelli et al. (2021). Red-

dening corrections were applied to the Gaia magnitudes using
the E(B — V) values also reported in Table 1, derived from the
dust maps of Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011). Extinction coeffi-
cients were taken from McCall (2004) for the K filter and cal-
culated following Gaia Collaboration et al. (2018) for the Gaia
filters, and applied individually. Following the Monte Carlo ap-
proach by Roederer et al. (2018), we estimated T.4 for each color
combination by drawing 10* realizations of the input parameters
(magnitudes, reddening, metallicity) assuming Gaussian errors,
and adopting the median of the resulting T. distribution. The fi-
nal T.¢ for each star was then computed as the weighted average
of the values from all color indices. For comparison, we show
the excitation imbalance in the left column of Figure A.1. The
slight trend in the Fe1 and Fen line abundances as a function of
excitation potential, y reflects the difference between the pho-
tometric and the spectroscopic Tefr. To reflect this uncertainty,
as well as the limitations of the 1D model atmosphere, the total
uncertainty includes the statistical weighted average plus 150 K
added in quadrature (Frebel et al. 2013). After determining Te,
the surface gravities (log g) were calculated from the fundamen-
tal relation:

°
+my — 5 log(d) + 5 — 3.1 - E(B— V) — Mpoio), (1)

M
log g = 4 log Tee + toe( 7 — 10.61 + 0.4 - (BCy

where M is the stellar mass, assumed to be 0.8 + 0.08Mo for
all the stars, being the canonical value for halo stars. BCy is
the bolometric correction in the V band, and my is the ap-
parent V band magnitude. The parameter d denotes the dis-
tance in parsecs, and the Solar bolometric magnitude is fixed
at Mbpolo = 4.75. The constant 10.61 is derived from the So-
lar reference values, log(Te#,o) = 3.7617 and log go = 4.438.
To estimate log g and its associated uncertainty, we computed
the median and standard deviation from 104 Monte Carlo sam-
ples generated for each input parameter. An additional 0.3 dex
was added in quadrature to the resulting standard deviation to
account for systematic uncertainties.

Metallicity, [Fe/H], and microturbulent velocity, € were de-
rived through equivalent width (EW) analysis of Fer and Fen
lines, where the EW is defined as the width of a rectangle, with
the same height as the line depth relative to the continuum, and
an area equal to that of the spectral line. The analysis was per-
formed by fixing Te and log g. The microturbulent velocity was
obtained by removing any correlation between Fe1 line abun-
dances and reduced equivalent width, while the model atmo-
sphere metallicity was taken as the average of the [Fel/H] and
[Fell/H] abundances, after manually removing outlier lines from
the Fer and Fen distributions that deviated by more than 2.50
from the mean abundance. This procedure results in a flat trend
of Fer as a function of the line strength (REW), as shown in the
central column of Figure A.1. The final [Fel/H] and [Fell/H]
values agree within 0.08 dex for all stars. Systematic uncertain-
tie on € is estimated to be 0.2 km s"!.

The final stellar parameters and their associated uncertainties
for the ten stars are listed in Table 3.

et al. 2021) and include isotopic and hyperfine structure broad-
ening where applicable, with r-process isotope ratios taken from
Sneden et al. (2008). Elemental abundances were determined
from a mixture of EW analysis and spectral synthesis. For the
EW analysis, Gaussian or Voigt profiles were fitted to single,
un-blended lines in the continuum-normalized spectra, while the
spectral synthesis was used for blended features and lines af-
fected by isotopic and/or hyperfine structure. The final abun-
dances were computed as the average of individual line abun-
dances. In Table D.1 in the appendix, we report the atomic data
for the lines used in the analysis, with the measured EW and
derived abundance of each line in JO040+2729. The same infor-
mation for the other stars can be found in the CDS material.

To estimate abundance uncertainties, we applied the method
described in Ji et al. (2020), which performs propagation of stel-
lar parameter uncertainties, incorporating statistical and system-
atic uncertainties on each spectral line. Moreover, a 0.1 dex un-
certainty is included for all lines to account for systematic uncer-
tainties like continuum placement and atomic data uncertainties.
Finally, an additional uncertainty of 0.2 dex is applied in quadra-
ture to all abundances derived from two or fewer lines.

5. Results

We inspected more than 1400 lines for each of the ten stars
in our sample and derived abundances of 54 atomic species,
including 29 neutron-capture elements. Abundances for Nat,
Mgr, Alt, Sit, Ki, Cat, Tit, Tin, Cri, Cru, Fet, Fen, Nir and
Zn1 were determined measuring the EW of unblended lines,
while abundances for all other species were derived via spectral
synthesis. Final abundances and associated uncertainties for the
ten stars are presented in Table B.1. The stars exhibit enhanced
[Eu/Fe] ratios, ranging from +0.39 to +1.60, and [Ba/Eu] be-
tween —0.52 and —1.01, as shown in Figure 1. Such abundance
ratios are indicative of dominant r-process enrichment (Sneden
et al. 2008), making these stars excellent candidates for probing
the nature of the r-process nucleosynthesis sites.

representing [Ba/Eu] for the sample of ten stars. All stars lie
well above the canonical [Eu/Fe] > +0.3 threshold typically
adopted for r-process-enhanced stars, and their low [Ba/Eu] val-
ues further confirm that the enrichment is consistent with a pure
r-process origin. Grey stars in the background are taken from
Roederer et al. (2014).

5.1. Carbon and Nitrogen

Carbon abundances were determined for eight stars using spec-
tral synthesis of the CH G-band at 4313A. For the stars
J0246—1518 and JO217—1903, no CH absorption features were
detected, and thus no carbon abundance could be determined.

Nitrogen abundances were estimated from the CN molec-
ular bands at 3876A and 3589A were detected in six of
the observed stars (J0217-—1903, J1430-—2317, J1916-5544,
J2009-3410, J2049-5124, J2109—1310). The NH band at 3369
was also investigated and detected in JO217—1903, J2049-5124
and J2109-1310, for which we obtained a lo consistency with
N abundance derived from CN, and in J1432—4125 in which we
have no CN detection instead.

Almost all the derived carbon and nitrogen abundances show
no extreme enhancements across the sample. Carbon abun-
dances, corrected for evolutionary effect according to Placco
et al. (2014), spans the range [C/Fe] = —0.35 to +0.55, while
nitrogen ranges from [N/Fe] = -—0.23 to +0.56. These val-
ues fall below the conventional thresholds for carbon-enhanced
metal-poor (CEMP) and nitrogen-enhanced metal-poor (NEMP)
of [C/Fe] > +0.7 (Beers & Christlieb 2005; Aoki et al. 2007)
and [N/Fe] = +1.00 (Pols et al. 2012), respectively. The only
exception is given by J2019—1310, for which the carbon value
minimally exceeds the CEMP limit, being [C/Fe] = +0.74

5.2. Elements from oxygen to zinc

We determined abundances for 21 atomic species with Z < 30
in all ten stars, including both neutral and singly ionized: O1,
Nat, Mgt, Alt, Sit, Kt, Cat, Secu, Tir, Tin, V1, Vu, Cri, Cru,
Mn1, Mnu, Fe, Fen, Cot, Nit, and Zn1. Additionally, we report
the detection of Sc1 in one star and the detection of Cur in four
stars in our sample. The Cur abundance is based solely on the
5105 Aline, arising from a high-excitation level (y = 1.39 eV).

Its intrinsic weakness and sensitivity to stellar parameters lead to
non-detections in most cases. For Sc1, the investigated lines have
central wavelengths between 3900 and 4050 A, in the near-UV.
For stars in our parameter range, this spectral region typically
suffers from severe line blending, and Sc1 is a minority species
in these stars, making detections difficult. The [X/Fe] abundance
ratios for the light elements are shown in Figure 2, where our
sample is compared to Milky Way halo stars from Roederer et al.
(2014). In that study, NLTE corrections were applied to Na and
K, resulting in systematically lower average abundances relative
to our sample. For elements where abundances of both neutral
and singly ionized species were derived, we plotted the average
abundance derived from the two ionization states. Overall, the
abundance ratios of the light elements in our stars are broadly
consistent with those observed in other metal-poor stars, show-
ing no significant anomalies.

5.3. Neutron-capture Elements

We analyzed spectral lines from 29 neutron-capture elements.
A detailed review of each of these elements is provided in the
following subsections.

5.3.1. Rubidium

We identify a tentative detection of rubidium (Z=37) in
J1430—2371, the coolest and most metal-rich star in our sample,
based on two Rb1 spectral lines, at 7800 Aand 7947 A. The first
one is a resonance feature, though partially blended on the blue
wing with a nearby Sir line, which complicates precise abun-
dance determination. Fitting this feature yields an Rb abundance
of log e(Rb) = 0.82 + 0.20. To support this result, we also exam-
ined another resonance line at 7947 A, from which we estimate
an upper limit of log e(Rb) < 0.91. Since this upper limit lies
only 0.09 dex above the value derived from the resonance line,
we used this result as a validation of the previous estimate, inter-
preting it as a tentative detection of Rb1.

5.3.2. Elements between the first and second r-process
peaks

Abundances for the light neutron-capture elements strontium
(Sr, Z = 38), yttrium (Y, Z = 39), and zirconium (Zr, Z = 40)
were determined for all stars in the sample. In particular, Sr
abundances were derived using the three Sru lines located at
4077, 4161, and 4215 A. Y and Zr abundances were measured
using line lists containing 41 and 51 transitions, respectively. For
each star, the abundance determination relied on at least 10 lines,
covering a wide wavelength range. We also report detections of
molybdenum (Mo, Z = 42), ruthenium (Ru, Z = 44), rhodium
(Rh, Z = 45), and palladium (Pd, Z = 46) in eight, eight, three,
and five stars, respectively. Mo abundances are based primar-
ily on the Mor line at 3864 A(shown in panel A of Figure 3),
with the line at 5533 Aalso contributing in a few cases, show-
ing agreement within 0.2 dex, when both lines were detected.
Ru abundances were derived using four Rut lines in the blue
region of the spectrum at 3436, 3498 (see panel B in Figure 3),
3798, and 3799 A. Rh abundances were determined from the Rh1
line at 3434 A(see panel C in Figure 3) for stars J1432—4125,
J1916-5544, and J2019-—1310. For J2009—3410, an upper limit
was derived using the same line. Pd abundances are based on the

We report a detection of silver (Ag, Z=47) in only one star,
J1432-—4125, based on the Agi line at 3381 A, which is the
only transition included in our linelist. This spectral feature is
intrinsically weak and frequently blended with NH molecular
lines, making it particularly challenging to detect in metal-poor
stars. Due to these limitations, no Ag abundances could be
determined for the other stars in our sample.

5.3.3. Elements beyond the second r-process peak

The elements from barium (Ba, Z = 56) to hafnium (Hf, Z =
72) are called Lanthanides. Their abundances are generally well
determined across our stellar sample.

For Ba, five strong Bau transitions in the optical range
were employed. Abundances for other heavy elements, namely
lanthanum (La, Z = 57), cerium (Ce, Z = 58), praseodymium
(Pr, Z = 59), neodymium (Nd, Z = 60), samarium (Sm, Z = 62),
gadolinium (Gd, Z = 64), and dysprosium (Dy, Z = 66), were
derived from numerous lines arising from singly ionized atoms
(typically more than 20 per element), ensuring robust abundance
derivations. Europium (Eu, Z = 63) abundances were obtained
using 10 Eun lines, while terbium (Tb, Z = 65), holmium (Ho,
Z = 67), and erbium (Er, Z = 68) abundances were derived
using up to five transitions, mostly located in the blue region of
the spectrum. Thulium (Tm, Z = 69), ytterbium (Yb, Z = 70),
and lutetium (Lu, Z = 71) were detected in nine, ten, and nine
stars, respectively. The Tm abundance is based on a maximum
of six lines per star, all located below 4300 A(one example
is shown in panel F of Figure 3), where line blending and
continuum placement become increasingly uncertain. Similarly,
Yb relies on a single Yb II line at 3694 A. In contrast, Lu
abundances were derived from a single, relatively unblended
line at 6220 A. Hafnium (Hf, Z = 72) was detected in nine stars

Article number, page 6 of 23

using five blue lines; although the features were relatively weak,
they still allowed for reliable abundance estimates.

5.3.4. Third peak elements

Osmium (Os, Z = 76) and iridium (Ir, Z = 77) are among the
so-called third r-process peak elements, corresponding to nuclei
with mass numbers around A = 195 near the closed neutron shell
at N = 126. We report respectively ten and nine new values of
Os and Ir, and an upper limit for iridium.

In our analysis, we investigated two Os1 lines at 4135 and
4261 A (Figure 3, panel G). The absolute abundances derived
from these two lines consistently disagreed, with the value de-
rived from the first line being systematically higher than that
obtained from the second by a minimum of 0.4 dex and up to
1 dex. Following the framework of “relative strength” as de-
fined by Sneden et al. (2009), which under LTE conditions is
expressed as log(egf) — v6 (where € denotes the absolute abun-
dance, gf the oscillator strength, y the excitation potential, and
6 = 5040/T ), a line with lower relative strength is expected to be
intrinsically weaker and consequently yield a lower abundance
measurement. The 4135 A line always exhibits a lower relative
strength compared to the 4261 A line, and thus should produce
correspondingly lower abundance values, contrary to what we
observe. This systematic discrepancy, which becomes more pro-
nounced in stars characterized by lower effective temperatures,
lower surface gravities, and higher metallicities, strongly sug-
gests the presence of an unidentified blend affecting the 4135 A
feature. This interpretation is further supported by an anomalous
radial velocity shift encountered during the fitting of the 4135 A
line. Given these considerations, we have elected to base our Os1
abundance determinations exclusively on the 4261 A line.

Similarly, we chose to base the Ir abundance solely on the
Irr line at 3800 A(Figure 3, panel H), excluding the one at
3513 A. To illustrate the reasoning for this, we show in Figure

so such measurements are not feasible. Thorium (Th, Z=90) was
detected in nine stars through three Th 11 lines at 4019 (Figure 3,
panel I), 4086, and 5989 A.In contrast, no uranium (U, Z = 92)
lines were detected. This is consistent with expectations, given
the intrinsic weakness of U m transitions.

5.4. Notes on NLTE

All abundances presented in this work are derived under the
assumption of LTE and using 1D model atmospheres. When-
ever possible, we derived the abundances from ionized species,
which are less sensitive to NLTE effects. In general, we did not
apply NLTE corrections to maintain a homogeneous analysis,
since 40% of our sample stars have stellar parameters outside
the ranges covered by the published NLTE grids. However, as
we aim to investigate scatter in r-process element abundances
we report the NLTE-corrected abundances in Table B.2 for the
subset of stars that fall within the available grids for the r-process
species Sru, Bau, and Eun, using corrections from Mashonkina
et al. (2022), Mashonkina & Belyaev (2019), and Mashonkina
& Gehren (2000) respectively. As shown in Table B.2, the aver-
age NLTE correction is relatively small for [Sr/Fe] and [Eu/Fe]
(< 0.1 dex) but significantly larger for [Ba/Fe] (~ 0.2 dex).
NLTE studies have also been performed for Nd, where Dixon
et al. (2025) found corrections ranging from —0.3 to +0.5 dex,
and Y, where Storm & Bergemann (2023) found that Y m lines in
metal-poor giants ([Fe/H] ~ —3.0, log g ~ 1.0) can have NLTE
corrections as large as 0.4 dex for low-excitation lines. However,
none of these studies has provided correction grids.

For more information, we refer the reader to the following
3D NLTE grids present in the literature for O (Amarsi et al.
2015), C (Amarsi et al. 2019), Na (Canocchi et al. 2024), Mg
(Matsuno et al. 2024), Ca (Lagae et al. 2025), and Fe (Amarsi
et al. 2022). Correction in 1D NLTE are provided for Al (Nord-
lander & Lind 2017), and for Ti, Cr, Mn and Co for which we re-
fer the reader to the MPIA NLTE database’ based on Bergemann
(2011), Bergemann & Cescutti (2010), Bergemann & Gehren
(2008) and Bergemann (2008) respectively. For Ni, Cu and Zn
corrections are provided in 1D by Eitner et al. (2023); Caliskan
et al. (2025) and Sitnova et al. (2022), respectively. For more in-
formation on the above-mentioned elements see also the NLiTE

5.5. Dynamical Origins and Orbital Properties

To investigate the possible origins of our stars, we explored their
orbital properties in the E—L, space. The total orbital energy
(E) and the vertical component of the angular momentum (L,)
were derived from the phase-space coordinates of the stars us-
ing the galpy package (Bovy 2015), and their values are re-
ported in Table 4. The results are visualized in the left panel
of Figure 5. This diagram displays the distribution of our sam-
ple stars in the orbital energy—angular momentum plane, where
E is expressed in units of 10° km* s~? and L, in 10° kms™! kpe.
The greyscale background represents the distribution of GALAH
DR3 stars (Buder et al. 2021) within the metallicity range —1.3 <
[Fe/H] < —0.9 dex. The thick black curve marks the dynamical
boundary between in-situ stars (with higher binding energies)
and accreted populations (less bound) originally calculated in
Belokurov & Kravtsov (2023) and shifted to the energy scale
of the McMillan17 potential in Monty et al. (2024). The grey
contours outline the region associated with the Gaia-Sausage-
Enceladus (GSE) debris, as described by Belokurov & Kravtsov
(2023) and adapted to our Galactic potential. In this space, two
stars in our sample, JO040+2729 and JO217—1903, appear to lie
within the GSE-defined region. To further test this hypothe-
sis, we determined approximations for the orbital actions using
the Stackel fudge implemented in galpy (Mackereth & Bovy
2018) to create the so-called "action diamond" (Vasiliev 2019;
Myeong et al. 2019), shown in the right panel of Figure 5. This
diagram plots the normalized azimuthal action, Jg/Jiot, against
the vertical-minus-radial action, (J, — Jr)/Jtor, providing a com-
pact view of the orbital morphology. Our ten stars are shown
as colored markers, with the color indicating their orbital ec-
centricity, obtained by computing the orbital integrations over
3 Gyr with 1000 time steps per Gyr, assuming the McMillan17
Galactic potential (McMillan 2017) and Local Standard of Rest
as Monty et al. (2024). The background greyscale again shows
the distribution of GALAH stars, while the grey box marks the
highest density region of GSE members in E—L, space, accord-
ing to Myeong et al. (2019).

Interestingly, while JO040+2729 and JO217—1903 appear
within the GSE region in the E-L, plane, they sit at the edge of
the typical boundary in J/Jio¢ assumed for GSE members and
well outside of the highest density region. This discrepancy indi-
cates that their orbital morphologies are inconsistent with those
of the GSE population, thereby weakening the case for their as-
sociation with this major accretion event. Further support for this
interpretation comes from their low metallicities of —2.72 and
—2.86 dex, which are significantly below the characteristic GSE
metallicity distribution, typically peaking around [Fe/H] ~ —1.5
(Myeong et al. 2019; Monty et al. 2020; Ceccarelli et al. 2024;
Ou et al. 2024). Finally, the GSE is known to be depleted in
[Eu/Fe] at low metallicities, with typical values of [Eu/Fe] be-
ing subsolar below [Fe/H] ~ —2.5 (Ou et al. 2024; Monty et al.
2024). These combined properties suggest that J0040+2729 and
J0217—1903 may instead be associated with other halo substruc-
tures or represent remnants of distinct accretion events. The val-
ues of the actions and the eccentricity are reported in Table 4
(note that with an axisymmetric potential like (McMillan 2017),
Jp = Ly).

In addition, we investigated whether any of the ten stars are
associated with the chemodynamically tagged groups (CDTGs)
identified by Gudin et al. 2021; Zepeda et al. 2023; Shank et al.
2023. We find that only JO246—5124 belongs to one of the 36
CDTGs identified by Shank et al. (2023), while the remaining
stars do not appear in any of the groups analyzed in these studies.

In summary, our dynamical analysis as mapped in Fig-
ure 5, indicates that the ten stars in our sample likely
originate from ten distinct astrophysical environments, each
tracing separate r-process enrichment histories. Six of the
stars (J0040+2729, JO217—1903, J0246-1518, J1430—2317,
J1432—4125, J2009-3410) lie above the dynamical boundary in
the E-L, plane (left panel of Fig. 5), consistent with an accreted
origin, while three stars have prograde orbits and could either
have formed in situ or been accreted, the last star have kinemat-
ics compatible with being a MW disk star. Working from the hy-
pothesis that nine of our stars are accreted from now-disrupted
dwarf galaxies, and one star formed in the MW we can use these
stars to trace r-process enrichment over a wide range of environ-
ments and estimate an upper limit on the scatter between them.

6. Discussion

This work presents one of the largest homogeneously and com-
prehensively analyzed samples of r-process-enhanced stars to
date. While most previous studies have been limited to small
samples, often focusing on one or two stars (Sneden et al. 2003;
Christlieb et al. 2004; Aoki et al. 2010; Xylakis-Dornbusch
et al. 2024), or relied on heterogeneous compilations from the
literature, our study provides a systematic and self-consistent
analysis of ten stars with robust abundance determinations. For
each star, we derived abundances for over 50 species. Notably,
this includes 29 neutron-capture elements, making our dataset
uniquely suited to probe the detailed structure of the r-process
abundance pattern. In addition, our kinematic analysis (Sec-
tion 5.5) shows the stars are not linked to the same accreted struc-
ture, suggesting that they each trace an independent enrichment
history. This provides a valuable opportunity to investigate the

diversity of r-process nucleosynthesis pathways across distinct
progenitor systems.

6.1. The r-process element abundance pattern

The complete r-process element abundance patterns for the ten
stars in our sample are presented in Figure 6, separated into
light (30 < Z <_ 55, left panel) and heavy (55 < Z < 92,
right panel) r-process elements. The abundances for each star
have been rescaled to the pattern of HD 222925 (grey dots and
a solid line) by computing the average abundance offset with re-
spect to this star (Roederer et al. 2018, 2022), separately for light
and heavy elements. We use HD 222925 as a reference, as this
exhibits the most comprehensive r-process pattern observed to
date. For comparison, the Solar r-process pattern from Sneden
et al. (2008) is shown as a grey dashed line. Residuals with re-
spect to the average offset to HD 222925 for each star are shown
in the lower panels. This re-scaling approach allows us to assess
the scatter in the r-process element abundance pattern, with min-
imal influence from scatter induced by the analysis, enabling a
clearer comparison across stars. The resulting trends and devi-
ations will be discussed in detail in the following subsections.
Plots for the individual ten stars, each rescaled to the europium
values of HD 222925, are shown in Figure C.1 in the Appendix.

6.1.1. Light r—process elements

The production of the lightest neutron capture (n-capture) el-
ements in the r-process has historically been seen to exhibit
significant star-to-star variation when rescaled to Eu, leading
to the view that their synthesis was not universal and poten-
tially involved contributions from multiple astrophysical pro-
cesses or sites (e.g., Travaglio et al. 2004; Hansen et al. 2012;
Spite et al. 2018). This apparent lack of universality is contrasted
with the relatively consistent patterns observed for the heavier
lanthanides. However, recent work by Roederer et al. (2022) has
challenged this picture by showing that several light trans-iron
elements, including Se, Sr, Y, Nb, Mo, and Te, when scaled to
Zr, follow a remarkably consistent abundance pattern in a sample
of metal-poor, r-process-enriched stars with a dispersion < 0.13
dex. These results suggest that, under certain astrophysical con-
ditions, the production of light r-process elements may also re-
flect a universal mechanism, potentially tied to a common nucle-
osynthetic site.

This picture of universality among light r-process elements pro-
vides an important framework for interpreting our abundance
measurements. In our sample, the Sr abundance presents a larger
star-to-star variation compared to Y and Zr (see left panel of
Figure 6), for which the universality seems to hold. However,
Sr abundance was derived from the analysis of only three lines,
compared to the other two elements for which over 20 clean tran-
sitions were investigated.

The limited number of Sr lines and their characteristics
(See Section 5.3.2) likely contribute to the larger observational
spread.

The derived abundances of Mo, Ru, and Pd exhibit sub-
stantial star-to-star variation, as it is shown in Figure 6. Such a
spread is qualitatively consistent with the scenario proposed by
Roederer et al. (2023), in which the deposition of fission frag-
ments contributes to the element-to-element abundance scatter
in metal-poor stars. However, the reliability of these measure-
ments is affected by the fact that they are based on weak and of-
ten blended lines located in the near-UV region (3400 - 4000 A).

Article number, page 10 of 23

These observational challenges can introduce systematic uncer-
tainties that may mimic or enhance real abundance variations. In
particular, the Mo and Ru lines often lie in complex blended fea-
tures, while the Pd lines are extremely weak and prone to con-
tamination. As a result, it is difficult to determine whether the
observed spread reflects true astrophysical scatter or is driven, at
least in part, by measurement limitations. Alternative diagnostics
would be necessary to disentangle observational effects from in-
trinsic abundance variations and to assess potential contributions
from fission fragment yields in this mass region for this sample.

6.1.2. Heavy r—process elements

The heaviest r-process elements, including the third r-process
peak and the actinides, provide essential constraints on the astro-
physical conditions and robustness of the r-process. Numerous
studies have shown that, for a wide range of metal-poor stars en-
riched by the r-process, the abundance pattern of heavy elements
from the second peak (Z ~ 56) to the third peak (Z ~ 76)closely
follows the scaled solar r-process residuals (e.g., Westin et al.
2000; Sneden et al. 2008). This apparent invariance, often re-
ferred to as universality, suggests that a single type of r-process
event (or at least a tightly constrained set of conditions) can ro-
bustly reproduce the heavy-element pattern over a wide range
of progenitor environments. On the other end, the universality
seems not to hold for the actinides, since some Milky Way halo
stars show enhanced Th and U abundances relative to the rare
earth elements (the so-called "actinide boost"; Hill et al. 2002;
Holmbeck et al. 2018; Placco et al. 2023). The other extreme in
the shape of actinide deficiency has also been detected in one star
in the r-process enhanced ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Reticulum II
(Ji & Frebel 2018). Therefore, examining the abundances of Pb,
Th, and U in our sample offers a valuable test of the robustness
and possible diversity of the r-process at its heaviest end.

Across our sample, the abundances of elements from Ba
to Er are consistently well determined and exhibit relatively
small star-to-star scatter (See right panel in Figure 6). This be-
havior aligns with the previous findings, where elements be-
yond the second r-process peak are known to follow tight abun-
dance trends, particularly in the highly r-process-enhanced stars.
These elements are typically associated with strong, relatively
unblended absorption lines in the optical range, which facilitates
robust abundance determination, in particular in high SNR spec-
tra. However, in the same plot (Figure 6), is shown how, at higher
atomic numbers (Z > 68), the observed scatter increases, likely
due to a combination of weaker lines and more limited line avail-
ability.

Moving to the third peak, Os and Ir abundances can offer
insight into the neutron density and entropy of the r-process en-
vironment, as well as potential signatures of fission recycling
(Alencastro Puls et al. 2025). Despite their importance, Os and Ir
abundances are notoriously difficult to derive in metal-poor stars
due to the weakness of their lines, which are typically located in
the crowded blue-UV region of the spectrum and often blended.
For this reason, not many abundances of those elements were re-
ported in literature before the recent work from Alencastro Puls
et al. (2025) who published 33 Os1 abundances plus five upper
limit values and 32 Ir1 plus eight upper limits. In our sample,
Os and Ir show a larger dispersion, compared to the lanthanides,
again likely due to the analysis of a single line as mentioned in
Section 5.3.4.

Finally, the actinide element Th displays remarkable consis-
tency across stars in our sample (Figure 6), with no significant
star-to-star dispersion, except for two clear outliers: J1430—2371
M. Racca et al.: The R-Process Alliance: Exploring the cosmic scatter among ten r-process sites with stellar abundances.

and J2009—3410. These two stars exhibit significantly lower Th
abundances, with a rescaled log e(Th/average of the offset from
HD 222925) ratios of —0.30 and —0.37, respectively, compared
to the average value of —0.05 of the other eight stars. This
suggests a potential case of actinide depletion in these two stars,
similar to what is observed in the Reticulum II star, contrasting
with the otherwise uniform behavior of Th relative to Eu in the
rest of the sample. However, we note that these two stars have
the lowest effective temperatures in the sample. We therefore
recommend caution in the interpretation of these abundances.

6.2. Cosmic Abundance Variations Across Independent
r-Process Sites

As stated in Section 5.5, the ten stars analyzed in this study are
chemically and dynamically untagged, and for the following fur-
ther discussion, we therefore assume them to represent tendis-
tinct r-process events. To provide a conservative upper limit, we
assume that the measured abundance spread for each element
arises entirely from astrophysical origins, neglecting any contri-
bution from observational uncertainties. We then computed the
standard deviation of the abundance of each r-process element
across the ten stars, after normalizing the light (Z < 55) and
heavy (Z > 55) elements to Zr and Eu, respectively. The re-
sults for elements detected in at least three stars are shown in
Figure 5, where the standard deviations a[X/Zr] and o[X/Eu]
are plotted as a function of atomic number, and color-coded by
the average number of lines used for abundance determinations.
We also plot the standard deviation of the ojzr/zyy ratio itself,
as a red horizontal line in the plot. This serves as a benchmark
for the total variation between light and heavy r-process element
production across the ten r-process events. The numerical val-
ues of the standard deviations of all the elements are reported in
Table 5. For most elements, the spread is remarkably small: we
find o = 0.04 — 0.09 dex (corresponding to fractional variations
< 18%) for the light r-process elements, and 0 ~ 0.08 — 0.12
dex (< 24%) for the heavier elements. A few notable exceptions
exist, including Ru, Tm, Yb, and Hf, where the dispersion ex-
ceeds [zr/Eu). However, the scatter observed for these elements
among the ten stars is most likely driven by observational limi-
tations rather than genuine astrophysical variations. For these el-
ements, we inspected up to six spectral lines, but in most cases,
only three or fewer could be reliably analyzed. This is consider-
ably less than what is typically available for other lanthanides,
as also illustrated in Table B.1. As a result, while the line-to-
line scatter within individual stars remains small (as it is clear
from Table D.1), the abundance uncertainty a, in Table B.1,
becomes larger whenever the determination relies on only few
lines. A similar situation applies to Lu, Os, and Ir: although
their dispersions across the stars appear smaller, the robustness
of their abundances is likewise limited by the very small number
of available lines.

The larger variation in the o[zr/gy value is also expected, as
this represents the scatter detected in numerous previous studies
(see Sec 6.1.1). This variation in the ratio of the light to heavy
r-process elements can be directly compared to the lanthanide
fraction of the r-process element production site. For example,
the ejecta of the GW170817 kilonova event (Kasen et al. 2017)
required a multi-component model including lanthanide-poor
and lanthanide-rich material to explain both the blue and red
parts of the light curve. The lanthanide fraction for this event was
later compared to r-process enriched stars by Ji et al. (2019), who
found that this event did not produce enough lanthanide-rich ma-

terial to match the stars. The ojz/zy) value of 0.18 dex found for
our ten stars thus provides a range of lanthanide fractions. Since
all ten stars in the sample presented here are r-process enhanced
(to varying degrees, as reflected by their [Eu/Fe] and [Ba/Eu]
ratios) and did not originate from one common environment, we
interpret the measured Cosmic Values as the maximum allowed
variation in abundance ratios produced by potentially up to ten
independent r-process enrichment paths operating in the distinct
environments where these stars formed.

This means that, regardless of the specific astrophysical ori-
gin, whether NSMs, magnetorotational supernovae, collapsars,
magnetars, or other channels, any viable r-process site must re-
produce element ratios consistent with the O.osmic Constraints es-
tablished here. In this sense, our measurements provide robust
empirical bounds on the diversity of r-process nucleosynthesis
pathways.

In order to investigate the potential effect of NLTE, we
calculated the scatter among stars for which NLTE-corrected
values for Sr, Ba, and Eu could be determined. The scat-
ter with NLTE-corrected abundances are O{s,/z-,NLTE = 0.11
and O7[Bga/Eu|NLTE = 9.05. For comparison, the scatter in LTE
abundances for the same six stars are o[s,/zr,tTE = 0.06 and
O[Ba/Eu,LTE = 9.06. While the comparison is not fully straight-
forward because only Sr was corrected in the [Sr/Zr] ratio, these
results indicate that NLTE corrections tend to slightly reduce the
scatter in [Ba/Eu] and increase it in [Sr/Zr], reflecting the dif-
ferential impact of NLTE effects on different elements (see Ta-
ble B.22).

7. Summary

In this work, we present a homogeneous and comprehensive
chemical abundance analysis of a sample of ten r-process-
enhanced stars. These stars are characterized by strong enhance-
ments in r-process elements and no significant s-process con-
tribution, having a +0.39 < [Eu/Fe] < +1.06 and -1.01 <
[Ba/Fe] < —0.52. For each star, we analyzed over 1400 spectral
lines, deriving abundances for more than 50 species, including
29 neutron-capture elements from Rb to Th. The derived abun-
dance patterns display the well-known universality for the heavy
r-process elements (Ba to Ir), with only mild star-to-star varia-
tions. A slightly larger scatter is observed for Tm, Yb, and Hf,
likely driven by increased measurement uncertainties due to line
blending and continuum placement in the blue spectral region.
A similar small scatter is seen for the light r-process elements
in the range 38 < Z < 42, while the elements in the range
43 < Z <$ 50 exhibit a somewhat larger dispersion across the
sample, possibly in accordance with the fission fragment depo-
sition scenario, proposed by Roederer et al. (2023).

Kinematic analysis of the stars suggests they are not linked
to a common birth environment but originated in distinct, unre-
lated progenitor systems. This sample thus offers valuable con-
straints on the diversity of ten individual astrophysical sites con-
tributing to r-process enrichment. To quantify this, we calculated
the cosmic standard deviation (Gcosmic) for each element among
the ten stars, representing ten different r-process nucleosynthesis
sites. These values provide an upper limit to the possible varia-
tion introduced by different r-process nucleosynthesis environ-
ments across ten independent stellar sites and are remarkably
small for the rare earth and third peak elements, for example,
O{La/Eu] = 9.08 dex and o7jos/Euy = 0.11 dex. A somewhat larger
scatter of 0.18 dex is seen between the light and heavy parts
of the r-process pattern (o[zr/zu)) representing the ratio between

Notes. Corrections were calculated for Sru (Mashonkina et al. 2022), Ban (Mashonkina & Belyaev 2019) and Eun (Mashonkina & Gehren
2000). Column | lists the star identifier. Columns 2—4 give the LTE abundances [Sru/Fe], [Bau/Fe], and [Eu n/Fe]. Columns 5-7 list the NLTE
corrections applied to Sr, Ba, and Eu. Columns 8-10 show the resulting NLTE-corrected abundances. These corrections are based on literature
values for stars where NLTE effects have been quantified.
