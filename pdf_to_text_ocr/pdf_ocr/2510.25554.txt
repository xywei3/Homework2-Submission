Abstract

Soil physics models have long relied on simplifying assumptions to represent complex processes,
yet such assumptions can strongly bias model predictions. Here, we propose a paradigm-shifting
differentiable hybrid modeling (DHM) framework that instead of simplifying the unknown, learns
it from data. As a proof of concept, we apply the hybrid approach to the challenge of partitioning
the soil water retention curve (SWRC) into capillary and adsorbed water components, a problem
where traditional assumptions have led to divergent results. The hybrid framework derives this
partitioning directly from data while remaining guided by a few parsimonious and universally
accepted physical constraints. Using basic soil physical properties as inputs, the hybrid model
couples an analytical formula for the dry end of the SWRC with data-driven physics-informed
neural networks that learn the wet end, the transition between the two ends, and key soil-specific
parameters. The model was trained on a SWRC dataset from 482 undisturbed soil samples from
Central Europe, spanning a broad range of soil texture classes and organic carbon contents. The
hybrid model successfully learned both the overall shape and the capillary and adsorbed
components of the SWRC. Notably, the model revealed physically meaningful pore-scale features
without relying on explicit geometrical assumptions about soil pore shape or its distribution.
Moreover, the model revealed a distinctly nonlinear transition between capillary and adsorbed
domains, challenging the linear assumptions invoked in previous studies. The methodology
introduced here provides a blueprint for learning other soil processes where high-quality datasets

are available but mechanistic understanding is incomplete.

1. Introduction

Physics-based modeling approaches have a long tradition in soil physics and have been applied to
simulate fundamental soil processes such as infiltration, evaporation, solute transport, and energy
exchange in the vadose zone (Green and Ampt, 1911; Gardner, 1958; Philip and De Vries, 1957;
Van Genuchten, 1982). Mechanistic modeling typically involves conceptualizing the problem,
deriving governing equations from physical laws or empirical relationships, and validating the
resulting models against experimental data. These models are then used to study system functions
and behaviors, test hypotheses, and assess the responses of a system to changes in the driving

forces or internal properties.

The process of deriving representative models in any natural system inevitably requires
simplifying poorly understood components of the system. For instance, soil physics makes
assumptions regarding (largely unobservable) pore geometry and its distribution within soil,
attainment of equilibrium conditions, or the functional forms of constitutive relationships. While
these simplifications enable tractable formulations, they are shaped by the modeler’s view of the
system that may bias the true representation of soil processes. While some assumptions are refined

as new evidence emerges, the original modeling and representation bias may persist.

To overcome some of these challenges, we propose differentiable hybrid modeling (DHM) as an
alternative approach to the explicit representation of certain soil physical processes (e.g., making
assumptions about pore sizes, shapes and their distributions). Hybrid methods, which fall under
the broader umbrella of scientific machine learning (SciML), embed neural networks within
physical models so that the unknown or poorly understood components of a system can be learned
directly from data while the well-established physical laws remain explicitly enforced (Psichogios

and Ungar, 1992; Karniadakis et al., 2021; Moseley, 2022; Shen et al., 2023). By constructing both
4
the physical equations and the neural components in a differentiable form, these hybrid systems
can be trained end-to-end using gradient-based optimization. This allows all parameters to be
adjusted jointly to minimize a downstream, physics-informed loss function. This dual nature of
these methods maintains the interpretability of traditional formulations while enabling discovery
of processes that are otherwise inaccessible through purely mechanistic or purely empirical

approaches.

Automatic differentiation (AD) which is the backbone of DHM (Baydin et al., 2018), has also
advanced other domains of SciML such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) (Raissi et
al., 2019). PINNs have been successfully applied in vadose zone modeling to estimate soil
hydraulic properties from soil moisture measurements (Tartakovsky et al., 2020; Bandai and
Ghezzehei, 2021; Minasny et al., 2024), to model water flow and solute transport using
geoelectrical data (Haruzi and Moreno, 2023), and to develop flexible non-parametric pedotransfer
functions (PTFs) for the soil water retention curve (Norouzi et al., 2025). While DHM shares
conceptual similarities with PINNs, it differs fundamentally in structure and training objective.
PINNs learn solutions that satisfy governing physical laws, while DHM embeds neural networks
within an existing analytical model or process-based model to learn the unknown or less
understood components.

To demonstrate how DHM can be used as a framework for learning complex soil physical
processes, we apply this method to the classic problem of modeling the soil water retention curve
and its partitioning to capillary and adsorptive components. The SWRC is a fundamental soil
property that defines the relationship between water content and matric head (or suction) in soil.
Modeling a variety of land-surface processes, including infiltration, runoff, evaporation, and

energy exchange at the land surface requires knowledge of the SWRC across scales (Gupta et al.,
2022; Tehrani et al., 2023; Turek et al., 2025). Moreover, partitioning the SWRC into its capillary
and adsorbed components enhances the modeling of the soil hydraulic conductivity curve and is
essential for determining the liquid—water interfacial area, which influences soil health and
biogeochemical processes, particularly the retention and transport of interfacially active

contaminants such as PFAS (Guo et al., 2020; Brusseau, 2023).

All existing SWRC models that partition capillary and adsorbed film water have been developed
based on specific prior assumptions and simplifications about soil pore geometry, the functional
forms used to describe water retention components, and the transition between these two soil water
regimes. Because these assumptions directly influence the resulting partitioning, different models
applied to the same soil can yield substantially different outcomes, reflecting the sensitivity of
predictions to their underlying assumptions (Or and Tuller, 1999; Lebeau and Konrad, 2010;
Peters, 2013; Lu, 2016; Weber et al., 2019; Ghorbani et al., 2025). Therefore, there remains a need
for new approaches that can learn the partitioning directly from data with minimal prior

assumptions, while still respecting key physical constraints.

In this study, we develop a hybrid model that learns the shape of the SWRC as well as the capillary
and adsorbed water content components from basic soil properties using a state-of-the-art
differentiable modeling approach. In key contrast to traditional parametric models with rigid
physical assumptions, our method relaxes these assumptions and instead learns a flexible,
physically interpretable, and data-driven partitioning, with only universally accepted assumptions
included. Our study introduces a new generation of SWRC models, which we term “semi-
parametric” (i.e., semi-analytical) models. In this new type of SWRC models, part of the curve is
described by analytical equations, while the remaining parts are flexibly learned from data using

neural networks, yet the final SWRC remains continuous, differentiable, and physically consistent.
We believe our work demonstrates the potential of the DHM framework for unifying physical

theory and data-driven discovery across a wide range of fundamental soil physical processes.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Conventional Modeling Approach

Classical models of soil water retention partition the total water content into capillary and adsorbed
(film) domains by assuming an idealized pore geometry and prescribed pore-size distributions. For
example, Or and Tuller (1999) represented the pore space as a unit cell consisting of an angular
central pore (e.g., square or polygonal) connected to slit-shaped corners that provide surface area
for film adsorption. By applying the augmented Young—Laplace equation, they calculated liquid
distribution within this unit cell as a function of both capillary and adsorptive contributions. The
model was then upscaled to the sample scale through statistical averaging over an assumed pore-

size distribution.

In semi-empirical approaches, the capillary domain is modeled by representing soil pores as a
bundle of cylindrical tubes that conform to a specified size distribution (e.g., lognormal). The
adsorbed water component is described empirically, and the transition between capillary and film

domains is represented by a simple linear or additive formulation.

Different choices of pore geometry, pore-size distribution, and functional relationships have led to
a variety of models in the literature that often produce divergent capillary—adsorbed partitioning

when applied to the same soil.
2.2. Hybrid Modeling Framework

Our hybrid modeling approach aims to construct a data-driven framework that flexibly learns both
the overall shape of the SWRC and the individual contributions of capillary and adsorbed water
from basic soil properties. Specifically, we aim to relax the restrictive assumptions in conventional
models: idealized pore shapes, certain pore size distributions, fixed functional forms for which
there is no universal agreement or any assumption about the transition between the two

components of soil water.

The hybrid model uses the same inputs and outputs as conventional pedotransfer functions,
translating basic soil physical properties to SWRC. However, during this mapping from inputs to
outputs, the model learns multiple intermediate processes implicitly, without requiring explicit

data for them.

We begin with universally accepted principles describing the coexistence and behavior of capillary
and adsorptive forces across the full moisture range. As we derive the governing equations from
these known principles, any unknown terms are treated as components to be inferred from data. In
this strategy, the semi-analytical expression provides the physical skeleton of the model while the
unknown parts are flexibly learned from data. To physically guide the model, we only rely on a

few physical constraints that are universally accepted.

2.2.1. Physical definitions and model derivation

Capillary water refers to liquid water filling the spaces between soil particles, held by surface
tension and the contact angle of water with solid surfaces, which leads to the formation of curved
liquid—vapor interfaces (menisci). The adsorbed film water component refers specifically to liquid

water retained in thin films by adsorptive forces, where a distinct liquid—air interface is present
(see for example figure 4 of Nachum (2025)). The adsorptive forces in soil arise from
intermolecular interactions between the liquid and solid surfaces, including van der Waals forces,
electrostatic double-layer forces, and structural (hydration) forces (Derjaguin et al., 1987; Tuller

and Or, 2005a).

The total volumetric water content retained in a soil can thus be expressed as the sum of its

capillary (@,) and adsorbed (@,) components:
6=60,+ 6, (1)

Note that all terms in Eq. (1) are functions of matric head. As a soil dries, capillary water drains
from larger pores and recedes into pore corners. Beyond a certain matric head threshold, water
persists primarily as thin films adsorbed onto particle surfaces. At this dry end, experimental
studies show that the water retention curve becomes linear in pF — @ space, where pF = log |h|
and h is the matric head in cm. This linear behavior can be described analytically by the Campbell
and Shiozawa (1992) model (hereinafter referred to as Campbell-Shiozawa model and denoted by
the subscript CS), which in pF — @ space is written as:

6 =(1 ur Je Q)
ee PFary °

Where @¢s is the predicted water content by Campbell-Shiozawa model, and 6, and pFg;-y are its
fitting parameters that determine the slope and intercept of this empirical model at the dry end.
The parameter pFq;y corresponds to the logarithm of matric head at oven dryness, where the soil
is assumed to reach zero water content.

The Campbell—Shiozawa model was originally developed for the dry end of the SWRC (i.e., the

higher range of pF values), where only adsorptive forces are active. In the lower range of pF
values, where capillary water begins to contribute, the expression for 0c; no longer holds and must
be revised. To account for this, we introduce a transition function, denoted as f, that modifies O¢5
in the mixed region, where capillary and adsorbed water coexist. This function is treated as an
unknown to be learned from data, and it is expressed as a function of capillary saturation, defined
as S, = 0,/0,, where 0, is the saturated water content. Accordingly, the adsorbed film component
of the SWRC can be modeled as:

9q = f (Sc) Ocs (3)

Combining Eqs. (3) and (1), the total water can be expressed as:

9a

0 = 6. + f (Sc) Ocs (4)

The second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (4) accounts for the adsorbed film water
contribution. When 9, approaches zero (i.e., at very high pF values), the retention behavior is
dominated by adsorbed water. In this limit, Eq. (4) should reduce to the Campbell-Shiozawa
model, Eq. (2). To ensure this, we reparametrize the transition function with a hard constraint that

enforces f(0) = 1:
f (Sc) = 14S. g(Sc) (5)

where g(S,) is an unknown function that is learned from data. Combining this equation with Eq.

(4), the total water content can be expressed as:

8a
ee 6
0 = 6, + (1 +S, 9S.)18s (6)

Inserting Eq. (2) into Eq. (6), we obtain:

10
0 =0,+[1+5.9(5)1(1-— Jo, (7)
PFary

It is worth noting that Eq. (7) reflects only a general structural formulation based on a few widely
accepted assumptions about water retention in soils. Specifically, it assumes that total water
content consists of two components, capillary and adsorbed water, and that the contribution of the
capillary component vanishes as capillary saturation (S,) approaches zero. In this condition, Eq.
(7) reduces to Campbell-Shiozawa model for the dry end. The function g(S,) captures the
transition between capillary and adsorbed dominant regions behavior without explicitly specifying
its shape and form in advance. Similarly, the capillary component, 6,, as well as soil constants

(i.¢., 85, PFary, and 8.) are treated as unknowns to be learned from data.

2.2.2. Neural sub-model for the capillary water

We replace the capillary water content (@,) in Eq. (7), which is a function of pF’, with a dedicated
neural network sub-model named NN,(x, pF; @-), which receives the vector of soil physical
properties x = [Sand, Silt, Clay, OC, BD] and pF as input. The vector @, represents the trainable
parameters (weights and biases) of this neural network. This network has two hidden layers, each
with eight units (i.e., nodes) (Table 1). By taking pF as an input, the network outputs the capillary
water content at the specified pF. This architecture produces a continuous representation of the
curve without limiting it to a specific functional form (Haghverdi et al., 2012; Norouzi et al., 2025).
To ensure meaningful predictions, the sub-network output is constrained to remain less than
saturated water content (0,). To enforce this, the raw output of the capillary network is passed

through a sigmoid activation and scaled by the @, value.

11
2.2.3. Neural sub-model for the transition function

The transition function in Eqs. (5) and (7) includes an unknown component, g(S,), which maps
the input S, to a scalar output. Rather than assuming a fixed analytical form for g(S,), we replace
it with a fully connected neural network, NN,(S,;,), and allow it to be learned from data.
Similarly, @g refers to the trainable parameters of this network. This neural network is capable of
approximating a wide range of continuous functions, which helps capture complex transition
behaviors. The neural network NNj(S;; @g) consists of two hidden layers and a linear output layer
without any constraint on the output value (Table 1). We designed this sub-network to be more
flexible to ensure that the shape of the overall transition function, f(S,), is not limited by the

capacity of NNg(S;; Pg).
2.2.4. Neural sub-model for the soil dependent constants

The Campbell—Shiozawa model and the transition function both depend on three key soil-specific
parameters: @,, pFg,y, and 6,. We assume that these parameters can be predicted from basic soil
physical properties, and therefore, we model each parameter using a dedicated neural network. In
our hybrid framework, each parameter is estimated by a separate sub-network: NN,(x; @,),
NNary(& Pary), and NN,(x; @,), corresponding to @,, pFg;y, and 6, respectively. Each sub-
network takes five fundamental soil properties as defined by x: sand, silt, clay, OC, and BD.
Additionally, each of the neural networks has two hidden layers, each containing four units with
Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) activation function (Table 1). Although a single multi-output
neural network could have been used, given that the inputs of these networks are identical, we

opted for separate networks to maintain clarity and interpretability in the modeling framework.

12
Since 6, and 8, cannot exceed unity, we constrain the predictions of NN, (x; @,) and NN,(x; @o)
to a range between 0 and | by applying a sigmoid activation function in the output layers of these
sub-networks. Similarly, several studies showed that the range of pF, falls between 6.5 and 7.45
(Schneider and Goss, 2012; Arthur et al., 2013; Lu and Khorshidi, 2015; Karup et al., 2017). To
ensure broader applicability and account for potential variability beyond these observations, we
constrain the NNg;y(X; ary) sub-model output to predict values within a slightly wider interval
of 6.2 to 7.6. This is achieved by scaling the sigmoid output of NNg;y (x; @ary) to this target range.
To keep notation simple, the explicit dependence on inputs (x, pF) and trainable parameters (@) is

omitted in the remaining text wherever it does not cause ambiguity.

2.2.5 Hybrid model and loss function

By embedding all the neural network sub-models into Eq. (7), we obtain our hybrid model,

expressed as:

13
9a

6 = NN, + [1+ (Ge) nna] (2- a an, (8)
ry

The total water content in this model is estimated by jointly training several neural network sub-
models. It is important to note that Eq. (8) is directly trained end-to-end on measurements of the
total water content as a function of pF (Fig. 1), and all the neural network parameters are learned
jointly. Therefore, separate training of individual sub-networks using distinct target measurements
is not needed. Instead, the sub-networks adjust their predictions during training so that the final
predicted total water content closely matches the measured total water content at each pF value

(Fig. 1).

In our hybrid modeling design, each measured point on the SWRC is treated as an independent
training example, paired with its corresponding soil properties: sand, silt, clay, OC, BD, and pF.
The key assumption is that, given a sufficient number of measurements, training the hybrid model
in Eq. (8) enables the model to capture the complete shape of the SWRC, including both the
capillary and adsorbed water components, which are modeled with various internal sub-networks.
A major advantage of this method is that it allows samples with very few measured points to be
included in the training set. This capability is not achievable with conventional parametric models,
where a minimum number of measured points from each sample is needed (Rasoulzadeh et al.,

2025).
The loss function used for training the hybrid model is as follows:

14
Where 6 and @ are the predicted and measured water contents, respectively, and they are both a
function of pF. The first two terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (9) represent the mean squared
error between the volumetric water contents predicted by the neural network and the observed
measurements, where Nez and Ng; denote the number of training examples from the wet and
dry ends, respectively. As shown by Norouzi et al. (2025), using separate terms for the wet-end
(ie., pF < 4.2) and dry-end (i.e., pF > 4.2) is necessary to account for disparities in sample
sizes and the narrower range of water contents typically observed at the dry end. The coefficients
are weights assigned to each term in the loss function which determine the relative importance of

each loss component during training.

The last two terms in Eq. (9) are introduced to enforce two physics-based constraints described

below.

Figure 1. Workflow of the proposed hybrid model illustrating the interior neural networks,

analytical formulation, and loss function structure for learning the soil water retention curve and
its capillary and adsorbed components. The model inputs, including soil physical properties and
pF, are fed into separate neural networks whose outputs are combined within the hybrid
formulation to predict the total water content, which is then used in the loss function. The entire
model, including all neural network components, is trained end-to-end, meaning that all parameters
are optimized jointly from input to output through gradient-based minimization of a downstream,
physics-informed loss function, without explicit labeled data for the individual sub-networks. pF

serves as an input only to the capillary neural network (NN-,).

16
2.2.6 Universally accepted physical constraints
Our hybrid model relies solely on general physical reasoning without imposing rigid or system-
specific assumptions. Here, to guide the model, we incorporate two physical constraints that are

broadly accepted in soil physics and supported by pore-scale understanding.

First, at high suctions in soil (i.e., for pF > 5), the soil water content is assumed to be entirely in
adsorbed form, meaning that the capillary water content should approach zero in this range of pF
(Norouzi et al., 2025; Tuller and Or, 2005b). To enforce this, we introduce a constraint in the loss
function. Specifically, we generate a set of residual (collocation) points, which are synthetic
samples with random combinations of sand, silt, clay, OC, and BD, paired with random pF values
higher than 5. During each training step, the output of the @, neural network at these residual points
is computed, and the mean of the squared values is added as a penalty term to the custom loss
function to encourage 6, to approach zero for pF > 5 (third term in Eq. 9). These residual points

are illustrated in Fig. 2a.

Second, the soil air-entry value, also known as the bubbling pressure, corresponds to the matric
head at which air begins to penetrate the largest soil pores (Fredlund and Xing, 1994; Sourmanabad
et al., 2024). According to this definition, when the soil matric head (expressed in terms of pF) is
below a specific value, the soil remains saturated, and its water content remains constant despite

further changes in matric head. This condition can be mathematically represented as:

do
dpF =0, DF < PFair—entry (10)
The air-entry value, pF gir—entry, depends on both soil texture and structure and is generally lower
in coarse-textured soils (Rawls et al., 1982). To implement this constraint within our neural

network, we set pF = —0.3 (equivalent to a matric head of -0.5 cm) as the minimum threshold,

17
below which the soil is assumed to stay fully saturated, with water content remaining constant
despite variations in pF’. As illustrated in Fig. 2b, we generate a set of residual points, which are
randomly sampled within the input space using pF values from -0.3 and -2.0. During training, we

evaluate Eq. (10) at these points and penalize deviations from this constraint by adding the fourth

term to the loss function (Eq. 9).

2.2.7 Model training via automatic differentiation

The hybrid model developed in this study involves several interconnected neural networks, each
containing trainable parameters (Fig. 1). These networks are coupled in Eq. (8) through a physics-
informed ansatz (i.e., a prior mathematical form assumed to guide the model). This coupling of
various neural networks results in a highly nonlinear system whose parameters must be optimized

to minimize the total loss function defined in Eq. (9).

18
Training such a hybrid system requires computing gradients of the loss function, Eq. (9), with
respect to all trainable parameters. To enable efficient and accurate gradient computation, we
leverage automatic differentiation (AD), a core feature in modern deep learning frameworks such
as TensorFlow and PyTorch (Baydin et al., 2018). Automatic differentiation automatically
constructs a computational graph during the model’s forward pass and traces the sequence of
mathematical operations from inputs to outputs. During backpropagation, reverse-mode AD
traverses this graph from the output layer back to the inputs, systematically applying the chain rule
to compute exact gradients with respect to every trainable parameter. This allows the model to be
trained efficiently using standard gradient-based optimization algorithms, despite its architectural

complexity and the presence of embedded physical constraints.

2.2.8 Hyperparameter optimization

The developed hybrid model consists of separate sub-network neural models, each designed for a
specific component. Table | reports the inputs, architecture, and activation functions of each sub-
network. All hidden layers across the sub-networks employed Exponential Linear Unit (ELU)

activation functions.

The output of networks NN,, NN;, NNqyy, and NN, were implemented with sigmoid activation
functions and were scaled appropriately to their respective physical ranges. Additionally, the
networks NN;, NN,, and NNg;y, which estimate soil-dependent constants, shared a similar

structure: two hidden layers with four units each and ELU activations.

We set A, and A, in Eq. (9) to 1 and 12.1, respectively, based on manual tuning. The parameters

A3 and A, were set to 10 and 5, respectively. These weights were tuned to ensure their

19
corresponding constraints were satisfied without degrading the overall performance of the model.

S, and S, which determine the number of residual points in sets | and 2, were both set to 2000.

The Adam optimizer (Kingma, 2014) was used for model training with an initial learning rate of
0.005. An adaptive learning rate strategy was applied, in which the learning rate was reduced by a
factor of 0.8 if no improvement in the validation loss was observed, continuing down to a minimum

of 0.0005.

To avoid overfitting, early stopping with a patience of 10 epochs was applied. Additionally,
because the capillary sub-network (NN,) directly influences the smoothness of the final model, we
applied L2 regularization with an intensity of 0.15 to all layers of this sub-network. L2
regularization prevents overfitting by controlling the magnitude of large weights in the network
(Ng, 2004). The model was entirely developed in Python and implemented using TensorFlow

(Abadi et al., 2016).

2.3 Experimental data and train/validation/test splits

For training and evaluating the hybrid pedotransfer functions in this study, we used 482
undisturbed soil samples from the publicly available dataset of Hohenbrink et al. (2023), which
include measurements of soil hydraulic properties for a wide range of texture types and organic
carbon contents (Fig. 3 and Table 2). The 482 soils were extracted from the main dataset
(consisting of 572 soil samples) with the condition that measurements of SWRC, soil textural

fractions, bulk density, and organic carbon content, are available.

Particle size distribution was measured using wet sieving and sedimentation techniques. The size
classes were categorized following the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)

classification system, which defines clay as particles smaller than 2 1m, silt as 2-50 um, and sand

20
as 50—2,000 um (Hillel, 1982). The selected set of soil samples covers eleven soil textural classes
of USDA system, making the dataset highly suitable for the data-driven approach in this study

(Fig. 3).

Organic carbon content was measured by high-temperature combustion using an elemental
analyzer. Bulk density was determined gravimetrically, by oven-drying the soil samples for at least

24 hours following evaporation experiments.

The dataset includes measurements of the soil water retention curve covering a broad range of
matric heads. The wet and medium moisture ranges (pF < 4.2) were measured using the
simplified evaporation method (Peters and Durner, 2008; Schindler, 1980), implemented via the
HYPROP device (METER Group AG, Germany). This method captures the drying branch of the
retention curve and provides high-resolution measurements. For the dry end (pF > 4.2),
additional measurements were obtained using the dewpoint method (Campbell et al., 2007; Kirste
et al., 2019) via the WP4C device (METER Group, Inc., USA). Due to the large imbalance between
the number of dry-end and wet-end data points, we uniformly resampled the wet-end
measurements to 15 points. For more detailed information about the measurement details and

device specifications, readers are referred to Hohenbrink et al. (2023).

Department of Agriculture) soil triangle. Point colors indicate organic carbon content (%) of each

soil sample. The abbreviations Sa, Si, and Cl stand for sand, silt, and clay, respectively.

To train the model with the customized loss function in Eq. (9), which includes separate terms for
the wet and dry ends of the SWRC, we partitioned the data for each end into training and test sets
separately to achieve a more balanced split. Seventy percent of the samples from each end were
used for training and validation, while the remaining 30% served as a hold-out test set. This
stratified sampling ensured that each subset, training, validation, and testing, represented the full
range of wet and dry conditions. The dataset comprised 8394 pF —@ observations after
resampling, of which 5916 pF — @ pairs (339 samples) were used for training and validation, and
2478 pF — @ pairs (143 samples) for testing.

To avoid data leakage and account for the strong correlation among water content measurements

within individual soil samples, we partitioned the dataset at the soil sample level rather than at the

22
level of individual pF — @ pairs. This ensured that all pF — @ observations from a given sample
were assigned entirely to either the training or testing set. Additionally, we ensured that samples
from the same soil profile (i.e., location) were exclusively included in either the training or the

testing set.

2.4 Evaluation criteria
Model performance was evaluated based on three metrics: root mean square error (RMSE),
coefficient of determination (R-squared), and the ratio of the interquartile range to RMSE (RPIQ),

all calculated using the predicted and observed volumetric water contents:

RPIQ = ae (13)

where N is the total number of measured points, 8 is the mean of the measured water contents, and
Q75 and Qs correspond to the 75th and 25th percentiles of the measured water contents,
respectively. The RPIQ metric offers a scale-independent metric by comparing the RMSE with the

variability of the data.

3 Results and Discussion

3.1 Physics-informed neural network performance

Figure 4 shows the predicted shape of the SWRC for twelve soil samples with different texture
classes according to the USDA classification system. The model is trained by optimizing the loss
function (Eq. (9)) over the entire training set as a whole, rather than fitting it sample by sample.
Unlike parametric PTFs, which use predefined analytical forms for the SWRC, our hybrid model
learns the curve shape directly from the data. Once trained, the model can predict the entire
continuous SWRC. To achieve this, for any given soil with fixed physical properties (i.e., sand,
silt, clay, OC, and BD), we vary the pF over a specified range to generate the continuous curves

shown in Fig. 4.

The discovered shapes of the SWRCs are smooth, analytically differentiable, and therefore suitable
for simulation of soil water flow (i.e., Richardson-Richards equation). These curves exhibit a
sigmoidal shape in the wet range, similar to traditional parametric models (van Genuchten, 1980;
Kosugi, 1994), and transition to a linear form at lower water contents, consistent with the
Campbell-Shiozawa model behavior assumed at the dry end. Notably, the transition between the
neural network-predicted region and the analytically modeled region governed by the Campbell-
Shiozawa model is seamless, with no noticeable discontinuities or abrupt changes, resulting in a
smooth, continuous curve. Furthermore, at the wet end, the curves remain invariant with respect
to pF for values below -0.3. At the dry end, the range of pF at zero water content, pFg,, for all
curves remains between 6.2 and 7.6, ensuring the satisfaction of the physical constraints imposed

at both ends during training.

The overall performance of the hybrid PTFs on both the train and test sets is depicted in Fig. 5. As

shown, the model demonstrates a close performance on both the train and test sets, indicating the

24
generalization capability of the model. This close performance between training and testing sets is
particularly important in developing continuous, non-parametric and semi-parametric PTFs, as

even small degrees of overfitting can distort the predicted curve, making it physically unrealistic.

The model achieved an RMSE of 0.049 m? nr? on the test set, which is reasonable given the
diversity of soils represented in the dataset, including eleven USDA texture classes, and samples
with high organic carbon content and very low bulk density (Table 2). The extent of variations in
soil properties is also reflected in Fig. 5, where measured water contents reach values as high as
0.8 m? m®. This diversity, along with dataset size, variations in soil properties, and measurement
quality, are key factors influencing the performance of PTFs. The performance of the PTF
developed aligns well with both continuous parametric models (dos Santos Pereira et al., 2025)
and continuous non-parametric models trained on HYPROP system measurements (Haghverdi et
al., 2018). However, due to differences in the datasets used and input predictors across studies,

direct comparisons are challenging.

sets.

The discovered partitioning of capillary and adsorbed film components of the SWRC for the soil
samples shown in Fig. 4 is depicted in Fig. 6. These curves are obtained by plotting the first and
second terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (8). The curves shown in Fig. 6 should be considered
as follows: at each pF, the total water content (black line) is the sum of the capillary and adsorbed

film water contents.

This data-driven partitioning aligns remarkably well with the physics-based models in the
literature, such as that of Or and Tuller (1999) model, which was developed by incorporating
detailed interfacial physics within an angular pore geometry. Specifically, the capillary component
dominates under saturated conditions for all soils. This corresponds to the point where the liquid—
vapor interfacial area is effectively zero. As pF increases (corresponding to more suction in soil),
pores of varying sizes begin to drain, and this process starts with larger pores. For each pore size,
there exists a critical pF’, often referred to as the “onset of drainage”, at which air starts to invade

the pore.

27
As drainage progresses, water films begin to form along the surfaces of the partially emptied pores.
With further increase of pF, smaller pores also undergo drainage, leading to a gradual decrease in
the capillary component and a concurrent increase in the contribution of the film component. This
reflects the physical process by which surface area becomes increasingly available for film water

as the capillary water recedes to the pores corners (Or and Tuller, 1999).

At a pF between 2.5 and 4 for all soils, the film component reaches a peak. Beyond this peak,
toward the dry region, both capillary and adsorbed film contributions decline; this is the point
where even the adsorbed water films begin to thin. This decline continues at very high pF values
and eventually the adsorbed water converges to the Campbell-Shiozawa linear model for the dry
end, with the extent of this linear region being dependent on soil texture (Fig. 6). Note that,
consistent with physical constraints imposed, the water content for pF > 5 remains entirely in

adsorbed form for all soils.

Another important point in Fig. 6 is the crossover between capillary and adsorbed component
curves, which determines the boundary between capillary and adsorbed dominant regions. This
crossover point is highly dependent on soil texture, and as seen in Fig. 7, with an increase in clay
content, the water content at this point increases. This is because the fraction of finer particles (i.e.,
silt and clay) provides a greater specific surface area, which supports the formation and retention

of more extensive water films along particle surfaces (Norouzi et al., 2022, 2023).

An important advantage of DHM is the ability to replace unknown or poorly defined components
with neural networks, which serve as universal function approximators. In our model, the transition
function f(S,) in Eq. (5), whose analytical form was not known in advance, was learned directly
from data. This function governs how the Campbell-Shiozawa model should be modified at pF
values lower than a certain threshold, where capillary and adsorbed film water may coexist. This
learned function is shown in Fig. 8. As illustrated, f(S,) exhibits a decreasing trend, which is
expected: as capillary water increases, the contribution of the Campbell-Shiozawa model to total

water content should diminish.

The transition function was designed with a hard constraint to satisfy f(S, = 0) = 1, ensuring full
reliance on the Campbell-Shiozawa model when the capillary saturation is zero (Fig. 8).

Interestingly, although not explicitly constrained to do so, the learned function also satisfies

30
f(S, = 1) =0. This behavior implies that at saturation (S, = 1), the entire water content is
attributed to capillary water, with no contribution from the adsorbed film component (Fig. 6).
Additionally, the transition between the two endpoints (S, = 0 and S, = 1) is distinctly nonlinear,
deviating from the commonly assumed linear transition (1 — S,) used in previous studies (Fayer

and Simmons, 1995; Lebeau and Konrad, 2010).

function from linear behavior.

3.2 Performance of the sub-networks for soil constants

One of the key advantages of DHM is its ability to train multiple internal models simultaneously
within a unified framework (Shen et al., 2023). In our hybrid PTF, we implemented three dedicated
sub-networks (i.e., sub-PTFs) to estimate key soil parameters, namely, 6,, pFary, and 9p, directly
from basic soil physical properties (see Eq. (8) and Table 1). Each of these sub-networks maps soil

properties to a physical constant. After training, each of these networks could be used as a

31
standalone PTF. It should be noted that these sub-networks were not trained with separate target

data; instead, they adjusted their parameters as part of the joint training of the full hybrid model
(Fig. 1).

Figure 9 illustrates the predictions of each sub-network, plotted against one of the representative
input variables, to ensure that these sub-networks have learned meaningful physically or

empirically known relationships rather than overfitting the training data.

The sub-network NN, predicts 6,.The predictions of this sub-network exhibit a clear inverse
relationship with bulk density in its input layer, consistent with the physical understanding that
higher bulk density typically corresponds to lower total porosity and thus lower water content at
saturation (Fig. 9a). Interestingly, for high bulk density values, the predictions align well with the
standard equation used to calculate porosity from known bulk density, assuming a particle density
of 2.65 g/cm?. However, for soils with low bulk density (organic soils), the predictions deviate
from this relationship, demonstrating the inadequacy of the 2.65 g/cm? assumption for such soils

(Marakkala Manage et al., 2019).

In Fig. (9b) the predictions of NN, are plotted against OC in the input layer. As expected, saturated
water content increases with increasing OC. Organic particles have lower intrinsic density with
more irregular, often fibrous structures than mineral particles, which leads to looser packing and
greater total pore volume. Consequently, soils with higher organic carbon content tend to exhibit
higher porosity and lower bulk density, consistent with observations in analytical modeling studies

(compare for example with the trend observed in Figure 4 of Robinson et al. (2022)).

Similarly, the sub-network NN, (Fig. 9c), which predicts 8, of Campbell-Shiozawa model and

determines the slope of the linear region at the dry end, shows a positive correlation with clay

32
content. As noted by Campbell and Shiozawa (1992), this free parameter is highly influenced by
the amount of soil clay content, which determines the specific area of soil. Higher 6, values are

indicative of finer-textured soils, which retain more water across a wide range of matric heads.

Figure 9. Predicted soil-specific parameters by the interior sub-networks of the hybrid PTF model,
plotted against representative input variables. The parameter 0, represents saturated water content
and 6, and pFg;y are the fitting parameters that determine the slope and intercept of the empirical

model at the dry end [Eq. (2)].

In contrast to the other two sub-networks, the sub-network predicting pFg,y, denoted as NNg;y,
does not show any clear correlation with the input variables. This is consistent with findings by Lu

and Khorshidi (2015) and Karup et al. (2017), who showed that pF, is more dependent on clay

33
mineralogy than soil OC or clay content. Although no strong correlation is observed, all
predictions from this sub-network remain within the imposed limits (pF = 6.2 to 7.6), which

were enforced as a hard constraint by scaling the network’s output to the target range (Fig. 9d).

These results collectively demonstrate that the interior sub-networks not only remained within the
specified physical bounds but also captured relationships that are consistent with established

physical and empirical understanding.

4 Conclusions and outlook

We have introduced differentiable hybrid modeling (DHM) framework that integrates mechanistic
understanding with data-driven learning in a unified framework. In this method the unknown or
less understood parts of a system can be learned from data by embedding neural networks while
the known physical processes are explicitly preserved.

As a proof of concept, we applied the DHM framework to the challenging problem of partitioning
the soil water retention curve (SWRC) into capillary and adsorbed components. At the dry end,
where there is general agreement on the dominance of the adsorbed water component, we used an
analytical model, while for higher saturations with more complex processes, we embedded
physics-informed neural networks. Our new generation of SWRC models, which we refer to as
“semi-parametric models”, successfully learned the overall shape of the SWRC as well as its
adsorbed and capillary component. Notably, the hybrid model learned pore-scale features without
relying on explicit geometrical assumptions about soil pore shape or its distribution.

Our model demonstrates a new perspective on the use of data in soil physics. We used the same
inputs and outputs as conventional pedotransfer functions, translating basic soil physical properties
into a soil water retention curve, but our main objective goes far beyond simple prediction. During

this mapping from inputs to outputs, the hybrid model learns multiple intermediate processes

34
implicitly, without requiring explicit data for them. Importantly, these learned internal
relationships produced physically meaningful results and as observed in the case of transition
function, the model discovered a nonlinear function that challenges the linear assumptions invoked
in previous studies. This represents a fundamental shift in how pedotransfer functions can be used,
not merely to predict, but to discover the underlying physical relationships encoded in data.

A great advantage of the DHM framework is its flexibility in design. As our understanding of soil
physical processes advances, we can incorporate more soil physics knowledge into the hybrid
model structure. For example, in this study we used the Campbell-Shiozawa analytical model to
represent the dry end, owing to its better fit to the approximately linear behavior observed in that
region. Future work could examine the use of more physically based dry-end formulations within
the same DHM workflow (Tuller and Or, 2005b; Smagin, 2025). From another perspective, the
internal components trained in our model could later be used as standalone predictive models for
specific soil properties or integrated into other modeling frameworks.

Given the increasing availability of large soil datasets, we believe DHM and its capability for end-
to-end training of several internal components (i.e., sub-models) within a single optimization
process, provides a promising tool that can be leveraged for modeling fundamental physical
processes where partial knowledge of the underlying mechanisms has led to over-simplifying

assumptions and biased predictions.
