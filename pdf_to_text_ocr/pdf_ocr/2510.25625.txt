In this work, we introduce HybriNet an innovative and robust framework capable of enhancing
spatial resolution, generating fluid dynamics databases for specific flow parameters, and predicting

their temporal evolution. The methodology is based on the development of a reduced-order model
(ROM) by integrating high-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) with machine learning
(ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. The ROM enables the generation of multi-parametric
uid dynamics databases concerning varying flow conditions, increases the spatial resolution, and
predicts the behaviour of the fluid dynamics problem in terms of time. This helps to accelerate nu-
merical simulations and generate new data efficiently. The performance of the proposed approach
has been validated using a collection of 30 two-dimensional laminar flow simulations over a square
cylinder at different Reynolds numbers and angles of attack. The databases reconstructed using
he proposed methodology exhibited a relative root mean square error below 2% when compared

t.
to ground-truth high-resolution data, demonstrating the robustness, accuracy, and efficiency of
the proposed framework.

Fluid dynamics plays a significant role in human life and is integral to numerous natural and an-

environment, fluid motion drives ocean circulation, shapes rivers and

channels, and transports sediments [1], [2]. It also plays a major role in air pollution, being responsi-

ants (which can be particulate matter, gases, or heat), as well as heat

and mass transfer [3], [4]. In industry, fluid dynamics is crucial for power generation, manufacturing
rocesses, lubrication, and refrigeration [5]. Thus, fluid dynamics research is essential for a deeper
understanding of flows, improving prediction accuracy, and controlling these physical phenomena.

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is widely used in both industry and academia to predict
he behaviour of a fluid in motion under specific conditions. This numerical method resolves the

flow: Navier-Stokes, conservation of mass and energy, among other

hings [6]. Numerical simulations of complex phenomena, such as turbulent flows, multiscale, multi-
hase, cavitation, etc., are computationally expensive, requiring significant computational resources
and considerable time to complete [7]. The development of reduced-order models (ROMs) is an al-
ernative to overcome the previously mentioned CFD limitations. ROMs are capable of drastically
reducing computational cost by approximating large-scale systems as simplified ones, which involves
finding a latent low-dimensional space to represent the full-order model (FOM). ROMs can be classified
as intrusive (ROMs) and non-intrusive (niROMs). The former requires the governing equations of the
henomenon to solve the unknowns, while the latter is purely data-driven [8].

Modal decomposition methods are widely used in fluid dynamics to understand the relevant flow
structures in fluid dynamics phenomena [9]. The data-driven nature of these methods makes them par-
icularly useful for the development of ROMs [10], [11]. Singular value decomposition (SVD) [12], [13]
and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) [14] have been extensively applied to extract the dominant
atterns and structures of a flow, being able to accurately represent the high-dimensional phenomenon
with just a few SVD/POD modes (it is worth mentioning that SVD is one of the two common methods
used to compute POD modes; therefore, the terms POD and SVD are often used interchangeably in
he literature). [15], [16], [17]

High-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) [18] is a multi-dimensional extension of SVD,
capable of extracting the underlying multilinear physics that is related to each of the dimensions
of the tensor [19]. Karasézen et al. [20] developed ROMs for cross-diffusion systems, where they
demonstrated the computational efficiency of the ROMs and the accuracy of the spatio-temporal
patterns for new parameter values. Kazeem et al. [21] combined POD-HOSVD to develop reduced
order models of different flow fields, demonstrating its application to reconstruct the flow and fill up
missing or incomplete data. Lorente et al. [22] demonstrated the robustness of the modal decomposition
method coupled with cubic spline interpolation for efficiently generating aerodynamic databases. This

methodology was applied to a set of steady-state 2D airfoil numerical simulations with flow conditions
varying across Mach number M € (0.4, 0.8], flap deflection angle J € [—5°, 5°], Ad = 1° , and angle of
attack (AoA) a € [—3°, 3°], Aa = 0.5° for the reconstruction of local pressure fields and prediction of
global aerodynamic coefficients with reduced computational cost. The increment between the a and 6
represents a significant limitation, as it requires the generation of a large amount of data. The method
shown in this paper addresses this limitation.

Machine learning has revolutionized various fields in recent decades due to the increasing availability
of high-quality data, novel algorithms, and technological advancements [8]. As mentioned earlier,
the data-driven nature of modal decomposition techniques such as SVD/POD and HOSVD makes
them ideal candidates for coupling with machine learning methods, which can effectively address the
n
oO

onlinearities of the phenomena under study [23]. Several studies have explored the enhancement
f niROMs obtained through modal decomposition with deep learning for different purposes, such as
super-resolution, flow feature interpolation and temporal forecasting. For instance, regarding resolution
enhancement, Hetherington, et al. [24] used SVD to enhance the spatial resolution and repair fluid
dynamics databases through linear and non-linear interpolation methods compared to DL approaches.
In the same line, Diaz et al. [23] combined SVD and deep neural networks to enhance the spatial
resolution of fluid dynamics databases, achieving reconstruction errors below 5%. On the topic of flow
feature interpolation, Aversano et al. [25] developed a methodology combining POD with Gaussian
Process Regression (GRP) to develop a digital twin of a semi-industrial furnace. Procacci et al. [26
developed a digital twin combining POD and sparse sensing for the same furnace. In the area o
temporal forecasting, Abadia-Heredia et al. [27] developed a hybrid-ROM based on POD combined
with deep learning architectures, capable of predicting over time using only the temporal coefficients
from various fluid dynamics databases. In the same line, Xiaoqing, et al. [28] combined POD with
Long-Short Term Memory neural networks to predict pressure time series using data obtained from
wind tunnel tests of a single square cylinder and two tandem square cylinders.

In this work, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, we present for the first time an innovative
methodology, referred to in this document as HybriNet, capable of enhancing spatial resolution, gen-
erating fluid dynamics databases for specific flow parameters, and predicting their evolution over time.
This has been achieved by applying ML techniques to the strategies proposed by Lorente et al. [29]
while overcoming the limitations related to AoA interpolation. Moreover, the tool extends the ideas
introduced in our previous work to enhance the spatial resolution of the data [30], and integrates the
redictive framework proposed by [31] to forecast temporal dynamics. To sum up, the main contribu-
ions of this work include: (i) the development of a hybrid, deep learning-based, multi-parametric ROM
grounded in physical principles; (ii) the combination of HOSVD with neural networks to perform spatial
resolution enhancement and temporal prediction while maintaining reduced dimensionality; and (iii)
he integration of HOSVD with GPR and deep neural networks to enable database generation for un-
seen flow conditions. The proposed methodology has been validated on a database of two-dimensional
square cylinder flows under various flow conditions, obtained through numerical simulations.

This manuscript is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the proposed methodology to develop
HybriNet; Section 3 describes the set-up for the numerical simulations and summarises the databases;
Section 4 describes the main results obtained and the discussion. Finally, Section 5 reports the con-
clusions of the work.

2 Methodology

This section provides a detailed description of the steps taken in the development of the fully data-
driven ROM: HybriNet. These steps include the organization of the data obtained through CFD, an
SVD-based temporal alignment method, and an in-depth explanation of the HOSVD modal decom-
position technique. In addition, a detailed description is provided of the various machine learning
approaches developed for data enhancement, the generation of databases under unseen flow condi-
tions, and forecasting. Finally, the error metrics used to evaluate the proposed method against its
counterpart are also presented.

2.1 Data organization

The fluid dynamics databases used in this work are organized as a multidimensional array, referred
to as a snapshot tensor, where the data are distributed on an equispaced two-dimensional grid. The
flow-related information, such as the streamwise and normal velocity components, Reynolds number,
angle of attack, spatial coordinates, and time, is stored separately within the tensor. This snapsho
tensor is a collection of matrices, where the columns and rows for a given time correspond to the
tensor fibres. In this work, the two-dimensional flow past a square cylinder was first organized into
fourth-order tensors and subsequently into sixth-order tensors.

For a two-dimensional time-dependent simulation defined by a particular Reynolds number and
angle of attack, the streamwise and normal velocity components are represented in a Jz x J3 coordinate
system (with Jz and J3 being the number of spatial grid points associated with each component, and
4 the number of snapshots varying in time) as:

V(%j5,Yjg,tk) for jo=1,...,J2, jg =1,...,Jg, and k=1...,K. (1)

This information is organized as a fourth order J, x Jz x J3 x K-tensor V, whose components
Vj, jojgk ave defined as:

Vijaigk = Va(Vjn,Vjgsth),  W2jojgk = Vy(®jn+ Vins th) (2)

where the index j; refers to the streamwise and normal velocity components (j; = 1,2 where
J, = 2). For cases where the database contains information under different flow conditions (such as
varying Reynolds numbers and angles of attack, Re and AoA, respectively), the data must be organized
as a sixth-order tensor (Jj x Z, x Zy x Jo x J3 x K). The flow condition data (Re, AoA) are contained in
the Z and Z dimensions, respectively. The streamwise and normal velocity components are organized
in a Jz x J3 coordinate system, as follows:
Vierzaiajak = Ui(R€z,,A0A2,, © j,Yjgrth), Waerzrjaisk = V2(Rez,,A0Az,, %j2,Yj3,th), (3)

where the indexes z; and z2 are related to the varying parameters Re and AoA that describe the
flows. On the other hand, j2 and j3 are the discrete values of the #- and y-axis, while k is the discrete
time.

2.2. POD Phase-Based Alignment

In order to achieve consistency across simulations with varying unsteady behaviour (e.g., due to differ-
ent Reynolds numbers and/or angles of attack), a phase-based alignment technique has been developed
using SVD. This method maps the temporal evolution of each simulation onto a common, phase-aligned
temporal grid based on the dominant flow dynamics.

Given a four-dimensional tensor, as in eq. (1), where the first three dimensions correspond to the
flow variables and the number of spatial points in the x and y directions, the data are reshaped into
a two-dimensional matrix:

KE RU 24s) xe (4)

where K denotes the number of temporal snapshots. The temporal mean is subtracted to obtain the
fluctuation matrix:
xX’ =xk-X, (5)

where X is the temporal mean computed along the second dimension.

Next, we perform SVD on the mean-subtracted matrix:
X’=U=xV', (6)

where U € R‘/1¥2/s)*" contains the r spatial SVD modes in its columns, © € R’*” is the diagonal
matrix of singular values, and V € R**" contains the temporal SVD coefficients, each one associated
with a POD mode. Here, r denotes the number of retained SVD modes (typically r < min(J;J2J3, K)).

A key property of SVD is that its spatial modes, the columns of U, are ordered by decreasing
energy, where the energy of the i-th mode is proportional to the i-th singular value o;. Hence, if u;
and u, are the i-th and j-th columns of U (with corresponding singular values 0; and oj), then for
any 72> j,

Oj; 2 Oj. (7)

Therefore, the i-th SVD mode contains at least as much energy as the j-th mode.

2.2.1 Phase alignment of the databases

The first column of V, denoted as vj, usually captures the dominant oscillatory behaviour in periodic
or quasi-periodic flows, since it is related to the first (most energetic) SVD mode. This mode is
normalized to lie within the interval [—1, 1] using the following transformation:

Pa vi = min(vi)

(8)

max(vj) — min(vj)

The normalized temporal coefficient Vi is used to determine the dominant period T of the signal.
This period is then used to phase-align all the databases, such that the onset of the dominant frequency
cycle in the first SVD mode occurs at the same time instant across all databases. This alignment is
crucial to ensure that the ROM can accurately predict the temporal dynamics of the system, as it
removes phase discrepancies. For a given number of snapshots ngnaps, each period is discretized into a
uniform temporal grid of K snapshots:

® {6 —, i tye}. (9)

The aligned temporal snapshots are obtained by extracting or interpolating the original temporal
coefficients onto a structured phase grid. Cubic interpolation is applied when the target phase positions
do not coincide with the original sampling points. This procedure ensures that all signal oscillations
begin at the same phase and contain the same number of samples per cycle, which is essential for
consistent phase alignment across databases.

Finally, the aligned snapshot matrix Xalignea is reconstructed using the aligned r POD modes
and reshaped back into its original four-dimensional spatial format with temporally aligned snapshots
across the phase dimension, as shown in Fig. 1

2.3 Data pre processing

Before the dimensionality step, normalization techniques must be applied to prevent the loss of relevant
information associated with small magnitudes that may exist in the database. Centering and scaling
normalization has been utilized in this work. Sola et al. [32] showed that adequate pre-processing of
the data can reduce both the absolute error and the computational time during training by almost an
order of magnitude [33] in deep learning architectures.

The combination of both centering and scaling transformations is also called standardization. This
method ensures that the normalized output Vstandardized has a mean equal to 0 and a standard deviation

of 1 [34].

The centering and scaling pre-processing technique has been tested on all the databases included in
this study. Centering and scaling were performed along the axes corresponding to variables, features,
and time dimensions.

2.4 Higher-order singular value decomposition

The High-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) is an extension of SVD for multidimensional
arrays. It was first introduced by Tucker in 1963 [18], [35], [36] and later popularized around the year
2000 by De Lathauwer et al. [37], [38]. HOSVD has been applied in several engineering fields, such as
aerodynamics [22], [39], fluid dynamics [40], and reduced order modelling [21], among other things.
For a six-dimensional snapshot tensor, the HOSVD can be expressed as:

Pr Po Ps Pa Ps N

1 3 :
Virzizaiziak © > > > > S> SprpapspapsnW5), W2),, WE), WO, WO) Ten, (11)

pi=1 p2=1 p3=1 pa=1 ps=1 n=1

where Sp, psp3pipsn is referred to as the core tensor, P; refers to the number of retained singular
vectors i—th mode, and WY, W?), W®), W, W), and T are the mode matrices resulting from
the decomposition. W corresponds to the number of velocity components (Le., streamwise and
normal velocity components), while W(?) and W(?) represent the Re and AoA, respectively. W)
and W©) correspond to the mode matrices for the a and y spatial dimensions, respectively. The last
matrix, T, is associated with the temporal component.

The mode matrices are obtained by applying SVD to each of the fibers of the snapshot tensor.
The set of SVD modes for each dimension corresponds to the eigenvectors associated with the positive
eigenvalues. These SVD modes are orthonormal and are organized in decreasing order based on their
energy content. The singular values are denoted as follows:

As mentioned above, HOSVD can be used for noise filtering and compression by truncating the
SVD modes in each of the mode matrices obtained from the decomposition. This approach aims to
extract the coherent structures of the flow, calculating the most relevant SVD modes associated with
each component of the database. This results in a compressed approximation of the database. This
approximation can be expressed as:

N
Vissi >. Wasvestaien'V ens (13)

n=1

where N refers to the spatial complexity of the tensor which determines the number of spatial SVD
modes W), 2, 25jj,n and the rescaled temporal SVD modes Vyn. The spatial SVD modes are defined
as follows:

Pr Po Ps Pa Ps

a) 3 4 5
Wanita = >) >. > DS YS Smoazerion WE), W2,,WO,We WE /os, (1)

pi=1 p2=1 p3=1 pa=1 ps=1

Tin = 0h Tn. (15)
HOSVD is applied to the original six-dimensional tensor, retaining an appropriate, tunable number
of SVD modes along each dimension. The number of retained modes is chosen to achieve an optimal
balance between data compression, accurate reconstruction, and effective noise filtering. The resulting
mode matrices for the Re (i.e., W®)), the AoA (i.e., W©)), the spatial dimensions (i.e., W“, W?),
and the time coefficients T, are therefore coupled to different machine learning approaches to expand
the database in terms of flow parameters, space and time. The mode matrix for the velocity components
(ie, W")) remains unchanged. These approaches are detailed in the following section.

The cumulative energy of the first r singular values was calculated as a measure of how much of
the total variance is captured by their corresponding modes. It is defined as:

wo?

E(r)= = 16

= Sr oF uo)

where o; are the singular values of the data matrix, ordered such that 0; > 02 >-+-: >». The value

E(r) € [0,1] quantifies the fraction of total variance (or energy) retained by the first r modes. This
formulation is widely employed to identify the most energetic modes in a fluid dynamics databases [41],

[42].

2.5 Gaussian Process Regression

Gaussian Processes (GPs) are non-parametric supervised learning methods used for regression and
probabilistic classification problems. Kolmogorov laid the foundation for GPs in 1938 [43]. Later, in
1978, Ibragimov & Rozanov formally introduced them in Ref. [44]. In 2006, Rasmussen and Williams
compiled previous theoretical developments on GPs in Ref. [45] and applied them to regression and
classification tasks, demonstrating the utility of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for both prediction
and uncertainty quantification. GPR models the underlying function as a GP, allowing interpolation.

The prediction of a solution in an unexplored region for a database X with N training points and
corresponding outputs y can be conducted using a GPR model. In general, the regression problem
can be formulated as:

w= fi) +2, e~N(,02), a)

where € represents Gaussian noise with variance 2 and mean 0. Under the GP assumption, the
function values follow a normal distribution during training, the function values follow a multivariate

normal distribution with zero mean and covariance K:

f ~ N(0,K), (18)

where K is the covariance matrix, defined as K;; = k(x;,x,;), representing the pairwise covariances
between training inputs. The function f(x) is modelled as a sample from a GP, which is defined as:

L(x) ~ GP (m(x), k(x, x’)), (19)

where m(x) is the mean function, which is typically assumed to be 0, and k(x,x’) is the covariance
function (also referred to as the kernel), which determines the similarity between function values at
different inputs.

For computation with a test input x,, the distribution of the observed outputs y and the function
value at x, is expressed as:
A oN C [* wn secre) (20)

where k, = K(X, x,) is the covariance vector between the training and test input values. The
posterior predictive distribution, after applying standard Gaussian conditioning formulas, follows:

P( fal X X,Y) = N (ta, 2), (21)

where the mean prediction is given by:

[sn =k] (K+ 07) 'y, (22)

and the variance (uncertainty associated with the prediction) is expressed as:

o? = k(x«,x«) —k] (K +.02I)"'k,. (23)

The set of optimal hyperparameters for the Gaussian Process is defined as:

0 = {o7, lon}, (24)

where of is the signal variance, which controls the amplitude of the function variations; ¢ is the
characteristic length scale, determining how quickly correlations decay with distance between input
points; and o,, is the standard deviation of the Gaussian noise associated with the observations. These
hyperparameters are estimated by maximizing the marginal likelihood, expressed as:

1 1 N
log p(y|X) = -5y'(K +o2I)ly - 3 log |K + 02]| — > log 27. (25)

2.6 Neural networks based on LSTM architectures

Neural Networks based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [46] architectures are widely used tools
for modelling and forecasting time series data [47] and are particularly useful for data with complex
temporal dynamics [48]. Generally, neural networks struggle with time series due to their inability to
retain information over long sequences, LSTMs address this limitation through specialized memory
cells and gating mechanisms namely, input, output, and forget gates which enable the network to
selectively remember or discard information across time [46]. This allows LSTM networks to learn
intricate temporal patterns and dependencies, making them especially effective for problems where the
future state depends not only on recent inputs but also on long-term historical context. LSTMs can
learn the underlying dynamics directly from data without requiring explicit knowledge of the governing
equations.

2.7 Development of the hybrid deep learning multi-parametric ROM: Hy-
briNet

This section outlines the methodology developed to construct a hybrid ROM capable of generating
new flow condition databases, enhancing spatial resolution, and performing temporal forecasting (as
shown in Fig. 2). The section is structured as follows: first, a general overview of the workflow is
presented; next, the generation of new flow conditions using GPR is detailed; then, spatial resolution
enhancement using ML and DL techniques is discussed; and finally, the temporal forecasting through
DL models is addressed.

along each spatial dimension, and ¢ indicates the number of temporal snapshots. W are the mode
matrices associated with each dimension of the tensor, o are the singular values, and S denotes the
core tensor.

2.7.1 Overview

The development of the proposed HybriNet focuses on the offline stage, which involves all the above-
mentioned pre-processing steps 2.2, 2.3, HOSVD 2.4, and its combination with different ML ap-
proaches.
The initial step, the database is in tensor form, as in eq. (3), and it is decomposed using HOSVD.

The resulting SVD mode matrices associated with the flow parameters, spatial, and temporal
dimensions are used to expand the fluid dynamics multi-parametric database. HybriNet has been
developed using a modular approach, where each module involves the use of a specific mode matrix
(or set of mode matrices) with a specific ML approach and is independent of the others.

The database upscaling in terms of space is achieved by the application of GPR to the W) and
W®©) spatial SVD mode matrices. The module developed for the generation of new flow conditions
interpolates the SVD mode matrices W) and W), corresponding to the Re and AoA tensor compo-
nents, using GPR. The forecasting module relies on an LSTM-based recurrent neural network applied
to the temporal mode matrix, T.

The expansion of the spatial mode matrices, the interpolation over Reynolds number and AoA
through GPR, and the training of the RNN are all conducted once during the initial stage (commonly
referred to as the offline stage). In the subsequent stage (referred to as the online stage), the decom-
posed tensor, the expanded spatial mode matrices, the interpolated Reynolds number and AoA modes,
along with the pre-trained neural network, are employed to perform predictions at low computational
cost.

2.7.2 Generation of multi-parametric databases through GPR

The generation of new databases containing information about fluid dynamics problems under dif-
ferent flow conditions, with varying parameters such as Re and AoA, is made possible through the
combination of HOSVD and GPR interpolation. In this work, the GPR library scikit-learn, available
in Python, has been used due to the robustness of its models. It is worth mentioning that other inter-
polation methods, such as linear interpolation, spline interpolation, and ordinary kriging, were tested
during the development of the methodology, but GPR proved capable of capturing the non-linearities
in the data, thereby improving the accuracy of the results.

The interpolation process follows the steps shown in Fig. 3. First, HOSVD is applied to the sixth-

points (i.e., fewer points in the spatial dimensions), serve as the inputs for another GPR, the parameters
of which are detailed in Tab. 2. In this approach, a Matern kernel, which is a generalization of the RBF
kernel, has been used. This kernel specifies the covariance between two measurements as a function
of their distance [45], and the smoothness of the interpolation is controlled by the parameter v; larger
values of v lead to smoother functions.

2.7.4 Temporal forecasting through Deep Learning

The prediction of fluid dynamics behavior has been achieved through the combination of HOSVD and
deep neural networks. In this study, the Keras API [49] is employed to develop a simple yet robust
recurrent neural network, RNN. The proposed approach is autoregressive, meaning that the neural
network’s predictions are recursively used as inputs for future predictions. This enables long-term
forecasting with reduced computational time. The generated data can then be used by HybriNet as a
ROM, of the CFD simulation, thereby accelerating the numerical simulation process.

Predicted temporal coefficient

Figure 5 illustrates the steps taken to forecast the behaviour of a fluid dynamics problem. First, the
weighted SVD mode matrix associated with the temporal dimension and calculated through HOSVD,
denoted as T, is extracted. Each SVD mode is then treated as a time series. To train the RNN, these
time series are segmented into multiple input sequences. Each sequence has a fixed length (i.e., the
number of time values used as input), and the network is trained to predict a future time window
defined by the prediction horizon h. These input sequences serve as the training data for the neural
network described in the following paragraph.

The RNN architecture developed in this work is simple yet robust. It consists of one LSTM
layer [50], followed by a fully connected layer to map the output to the desired dimensions, and a
reshape layer to ensure consistency in output structure. The Adam optimizer [51] is used for training.
Mean Squared Error (MSE) is employed as the loss function during training, while Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) is used for validation. The number of LSTM units, neurons, and other details are
summarized in Table 3.

The LSTM layer was selected due to its ability to learn long-term dependencies in time series data.
This is achieved through a gating mechanism that controls the flow of information. It includes three
main gates: the forget gate, the input gate, and the output gate. The forget gate determines which
past information should be discarded; the input gate decides which new information should be stored;
and the output gate regulates the information passed to the next time step [50].

The temporal matrix T is split into three subsets for training (70% of the total data), validation
15%), and testing (15%), following standard machine learning practices.

2.7.5 Error metrics

IN this work, we have considered two error measures:

12
Relative root mean squared error - RRMSE The Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE)
is a metric used to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed approaches by comparing the predicted tensor
reconstruction V with the reference tensor V obtained from CFD simulations. This comparison is
performed for a specific Reynolds number, AoA, spatial resolution, and forecast horizon. The RRMSE
is defined as:

RRMSE = ——_————,

where V; and V; represent the components of the ground truth and predicted tensors, respectively,
and N is the number of snapshots. A lower RRMSE value indicates higher reconstruction accuracy.

Estimated probability density function of the normalized error The normalized error is
defined as the difference between the ground truth tensor V and the reconstructed tensor V"*. This
value is then normalised between 0 and 1 by the maximum absolute error and can be expressed as:

vi -v¥s
—_—s te _
max([V; — VES)’

e=

(27)

where V; is the real value, VY’ is the predicted value, and max(|V; — VY’5|) is the maximum absolute
error among all data points.

The distribution of the normalized error of the predicted database is displayed in a relative frequency
histogram, where the optimal number of bins or classes for a histogram have been calculated using the
Sturges rule, expressed as:

kpins = 1+ loga(N), (28)

where N corresponds to the number of spatial points per snapshot.

3 Database

The validation of the methodology has been performed using a database composed of a set of two-
dimensional numerical simulations that recreate the behaviour of a laminar flow passing over a square
cylinder. This section details the governing equations of the problem under study, the set-up of
the numerical simulation in regards of the computational domain, grid development, and boundary
conditions.

The results obtained through the numerical simulations of the two-dimensional laminar flow over
a square cylinder are finally organized in a 6th-order tensor, as in eq. (3). The characteristics of
this tensor are detailed in Tab. 4. Figure 6 displays the design space of the database, the generated
databases for unseen flow conditions must be inside these limits.

3.1 Flow around a square cylinder

The flow around square cylinders is a widely studied problem in fluid dynamics. It is characterized
y flow separation at the sharp corners of the square cylinder, creating low-pressure zones behind the
cylinder that promote the formation of vortex shedding. At Reynolds numbers above 4000, this vortex
shedding becomes turbulent, leading to aleatory fluctuations in the flow patterns [52].

The flow around square cylinders has been selected as a benchmark problem for this study due
0 the extensive research conducted on this phenomenon under various flow conditions over the past
decades. This background enables the analysis of different flow parameters such as AoA and Re.
Variations in these parameters are known to induce significant changes in the flow topology, including
alterations in the onset and location of flow separation, modifications in the wake structure, transition
etween steady and unsteady regimes, and changes in vortex shedding frequency and symmetry [53].

14
Studying the flow around a square cylinder is particularly relevant as it serves as a simplified model for
understanding flow behaviour around bluff bodies, similar to those encountered in urban environments.

3.2 Governing equations

The governing equations for an incompressible, two-dimensional Newtonian flow are given by the
continuity and Navier-Stokes equations, written as:

Ov 1
V-v=0, BE t(v-V)v Vet Ze

Vv. (29)

where v is the non-dimensional velocity vector containing the streamwise and normal components
in a two-dimensional setting, defined as (vz, vy), and p is the pressure. Length, time, velocity, and
pressure are non-dimensionalized using L*, L*/V*, V*, and p*V,*?, respectively. The Reynolds number
is given by Re = V,*L%/v*, where the superscript * indicates dimensional quantities. Here, Lz is the
side length of the square, and V,* is the incoming free-stream velocity.

3.3. Geometry, computational domain, mesh and boundary conditions

For these two-dimensional simulations, the domain geometry has been developed in a Cartesian coor-
dinate system in the X-Y plane, following the criteria of [53]. The characteristic length of the square
cylinder is referred to as “ZL,” and was used to adimensionalize the domain. The distance considered
for the upstream is 16L, while for the downstream is 25L,. The distance between the superior and
inferior boundaries is 57LZ,. Figure 8, illustrates the distribution in the computational domain. For the
above-described configuration, a set of numerical simulations will be performed for flows with various
Reynolds numbers in laminar regime (Re from 200 to 600 in steps of 20) and also for a different set of
AoA (values from 50 to 30° in steps of 5°).

A structured grid consisting of 112,000 hexahedral elements was generated using Gmsh 4.13.1,
following the meshing methodology proposed by [54], which is recognized for its high accuracy in
laminar flow simulations. This grid resolution is sufficient to construct a high-quality database for
the evaluation of HybridNet. The resulting database supports three key capabilities: (i) enhancing
spatial resolution, (ii) interpolating to infer flow fields at previously unseen Reynolds numbers and
angles of attack, and (iii) producing time-accurate predictions. The primary objective of this work is
to demonstrate the practical application of HybridNet, which is introduced here for the first time.

Figure 9: Structured mesh developed for the two-dimensional numerical simulation of the laminar
flow past a square cylinder.

The numerical simulations have been performed using OpenFOAM 9 [55], an open-source CFD
solver based on the finite volume method for spatial discretization. The temporal discretization em-
ploys a second-order Euler scheme, while the pressure-velocity coupling is handled using the PIMPLE
algorithm, which is a combination of PISO (Pressure Implicit with Splitting of Operator) and SIMPLE
(Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure-Linked Equations) methods. The simulation has been performed
using the PIMPLE algorithm, which is used for transient simulations. The boundary conditions were
set as follows: a Dirichlet condition was imposed for the velocity at the inlet, where the streamwise
and crosswise components were defined as U, = Ux cos(AoA), Uy = Ux. sin(AoA), with U. = 1. At
the outlet, a Dirichlet condition for pressure (p = 0) and a zero-gradient (Neumann) condition for
velocity were applied, allowing for outflow. On the top and bottom boundaries, zero-gradient con-
ditions for velocity and fixed pressure were imposed as open-flow conditions. The Reynolds number
was controlled by varying the dynamic viscosity of the fluid while maintaining a constant free-stream
velocity. Variations in AoA were introduced by adjusting the inlet velocity vector. The time step has
been established as A t = 0.001 [s], with a total simulation time of 5 [s] with a writing interval of the
flow variables of 0.02 {s]. Figure 10 depicts the boundary conditions set in the computational domain.

is applied to velocity. Top and bottom boundaries are treated as open-flow with zero-gradient velocity
and fixed pressure.

4 Results and discussion

This section presents the results obtained from applying the proposed HybriNet for resolution enhance-
ment, forecasting, and multi-parametric database generation. This section is organized as follows: first,
an analysis of the singular value decay for each of the SVD mode matrices associated with Re, AoA,
and temporal dimensions is provided, together with the GPR interpolation results. Then, the results
obtained for the four different test cases considered for the validation of this method are discussed.
Finally, a summary of the prediction of RRMSE is presented.

To demonstrate the efficiency, robustness, and accuracy of the proposed tool, two different scenarios
have been considered: the completion of inconsistent multi-parametric databases and the generation of
databases for unseen flow conditions. These results have been evaluated using the error metrics detailed
in Sec. 2.7.5. Table 5 provides a detailed overview of the aforementioned test cases, the techniques
employed, and their corresponding scenarios. Table 6 collects the prediction RRMSE, calculated as in
eq. (26) of the test cases detailed in Tab. 5.

4.1 HOSVD analysis and GPR interpolation for Re and AoA

As mentioned in Section 2.4, the singular values of?) (Eq. (12)) associated with each dimension of

the tensor result from applying HOSVD to the database. To perform dimensionality reduction and
determine how many modes to retain in each mode matrix, the energy content of the singular values
was analyzed along the Re dimension (7) and the AoA dimension (o()).

For the Re dimension, the associated singular values o), the cumulative energy content per SVD
mode, and the singular value decay are displayed in Fig. 11. Figure lla shows a significant drop in
singular value magnitudes between the first and second modes, forming a sharp elbow. This suggests
that the first two singular values are considerably more important than the rest. The same trend is

seen in the cumulative energy plot (Fig. 11b), where the first two singular values account for 99.8% of
the total energy. As a result, dimensionality reduction can be applied by keeping only the first three
modes, which together capture more than 99.9% of the total energy.

Regarding the AoA dimension, Fig. 12a shows a significant decay in the ¢) magnitudes between
the first and second modes, followed by a more gradual decline in the subsequent modes. In contrast
to the Re dimension (Fig. 11), the cumulative energy plot in Fig. 12b indicates that 96% of the energy
is captured by the first mode. However, to exceed 99% of the total energy, at least four modes must be
retained. It is important to note that only 5 Reynolds numbers are available in the database. Therefore,
the input matrix for the Re dimension has a rank of 5, which limits the maximum number of singular
values to 5. To ensure accurate reconstruction, the first four modes along the AoA dimension have
been selected, accounting for over 99.5% of the total energy.

region representing the 90% confidence interval, as shown in Fig. 13b and Fig. 13c. In contrast,
the piecewise linear interpolation consists of straight segments that fail to capture the underlying
curvature or non-linear trends, thereby missing key variations in the data. Multiple reconstruction
tests were conducted using both methods, and GPR consistently produced more accurate results due
to its ability to model non-linear behaviour. Notably, in Fig. 13a, the confidence interval region is
barely visible. This results from the GPR model fitting the underlying function with high accuracy
low uncertainty, leading to a very narrow confidence interval.

Figure 14 compares the results obtained by applying GPR and piecewise linear interpolation along
each of the retained SVD modes associated with the AoA dimension. It can be observed that in the
first SVD mode (Fig. 14a), the data distribution shows a linear trend with a negative slope, where
both the regression and interpolation methods produce similar results. Similar to the first mode, the
second mode shows initially a linear trend with a positive slope, where GPR and piecewise linear
interpolation provide similar results up to the singular value corresponding to AoA = 20°, beyond
which GPR smoothly captures the trend of the data. For the third and fourth modes, displayed in
Fig. 14c and Fig. 14d, respectively, it can be observed that GPR addresses the non-linear behaviour
of the data, providing a smooth fit.

4.2 HOSVD analysis for the X and Y spatial dimensions

The singular value decay along the X and Y spatial dimensions, denoted as 04) and o°) respectively,
is shown in Fig. ??. It is observed that, apart from the drop between the first and second singular
values, there is no significant decay in magnitude thereafter. To determine an appropriate trunca-
tion threshold for dimensionality reduction, the cumulative energy distribution has also been plotted
(Fig. ??). Figure 15c indicates that approximately 99.9% of the total energy in the X dimension is
captured by the first 11 SVD modes, while 15 modes are required along the Y dimension to retain
99.9% of the energy (Fig. 15d).

4.3. HOSVD analysis and RNN forecasting for the temporal dimension

Figure 16 displays the singular value decay and cumulative energy plots along the temporal dimension.
Figure 16a exhibits a significant decrease in the magnitudes of the first two SVD modes, followed by
a more gradual decrease in subsequent modes. From the third to the fourth SVD mode, the decay
becomes even less pronounced, and beyond this point, the singular values remain nearly constant,
forming an almost horizontal line indicative of negligible decay. The cumulative energy plot displayed
in Fig. 16b shows that almost 99.9% of the total energy is contained in the first 7 SVD modes. Thus,
a highly accurate approximation of the full-order model can be achieved retaining 7 SVD modes.

Figure 17 presents the predictions obtained using the RNN for each of the retained SVD modes
along the temporal mode matrix T. The first three modes exhibit low-frequency oscillations, indicating
the presence of dominant flow features. From the fourth mode onward, the frequency of oscillations
increases, and slight variations in amplitude become more noticeable, reflecting more complex and
higher-frequency dynamics. The region where the prediction overlaps with the ground truth corre-
sponds to the test set. In this region, the predicted curves show a strong agreement with the ground
truth, suggesting that the model generalizes well across the temporal domain. The smooth transition
from ground truth to predicted data confirms that the RNN has effectively learned the underlying
temporal dynamics of the system. Overall, the predicted time series matches the trends and frequency
content of each mode, indicating that the neural network successfully captures the temporal behaviour
embedded in the low-dimensional representation of the system.

4.4 Filling missing data from incomplete databases

This section presents the results obtained using the proposed HybriNet to fill in missing flow data from
incomplete databases (FRe, FAoA tasks on Tab. 5), where one or more flow conditions are missing
from the original database. Figure 18b summarizes the two different cases considered, where the goal
is to obtain an evenly sampled database in terms of Re and AoA: filling in a missing AoA for all Re
numbers (Fig. 18a), and filling in a missing Re number for all AoA values. Table 6 collects the RRMSE
for streamwise and normal velocity components for the different test cases addressed using HybriNet.

Figure 19 presents a comparison of the predictions obtained using the proposed HybriNet model
to reconstruct missing data in the database for the FAoA case (AoA = 15°). The model predicts the
flow fields across all Re in the database for this missing AoA. Although the interpolation is performed
along the AoA dimension with one value missing, the model accurately captures the flow behaviour.
The streamwise and normal velocity components are well predicted in both the high-resolution case
(with an upscaling factor of 2) and the low-resolution one, closely matching the ground truth data.
The MSE distribution for both velocity components shows the highest values near the square cylinder,
which is mainly due to the dimensionality reduction. However, in the wake region and the rest of the
domain, the MSE values are very low, indicating good predictive performance overall.

Figure 20 shows the streamwise and normal velocity contours predicted for the FRe case (Re= 260).
The model predicts the flow fields across all AoA in the database for this missing Re. Similar to Fig. 19,

24
the interpolation is performed along an incomplete set of Reynolds numbers and demonstrates high
accuracy in predicting the flow field. For both velocity components, the HybriNet model successfully
reconstructs and upscales the flow structures both upstream and downstream of the square cylinder,
capturing the flow behaviour under these specific conditions. The MSE distribution for the streamwise
velocity shows the highest values near the top and bottom of the bluff body. In contrast, for the normal
velocity component, the maximum MSE values are located in the wake region behind the cylinder.

The evolution of the streamwise velocity at a point of interest (x = 70, y = 80), located in the wake
region behind the bluff body, is shown in Fig. 21 for the FRe case and Fig. 22 for the FAoA case. The
predicted and reference values closely match over time steps 106 to 128, which correspond to the test
set excluded during the training of the LSTM-based neural network. This overlap indicates that the
network was properly trained using the 7 retained SVD modes from the temporal mode matrix T and
is capable of accurately predicting future flow snapshots. Beyond the test interval, the predicted time
series continues to follow the ground truth data closely, confirming that the model effectively captures
the temporal dynamics of the flow at this location.

Figure 22: FRe task; Same as 21 but with Re = 260 and AoA = 20°.

Figure 23 shows the normalized error distribution plotted as relative frequency histograms for the
streamwise and normal velocity components in the FRe test case. Figure 23a indicates that almos
90% of the error values for the streamwise component are clustered near zero and a slight bias toward
negative values. The normalized error histogram for the normal velocity component (Fig. 23a) shows
that over 90% of the values centred around zero within an error range of +0.1, showing no visible bias
toward positive or negative values. This distribution aligns well with the MSE distribution presented
in Fig. 19 and the low RRMSE values detailed in Tab. 6.

In the same manner as Fig. 23, the normalized error relative frequency for the streamwise and

4.5 Generation of databases for unseen flow conditions.

This section presents the results obtained for generating data under unseen flow conditions using the
proposed HybriNet. Two distinct cases were considered, with the objective of predicting flow conditions
where neither the AoA nor the Reynolds number exist in the original database: generating a database
for AoA = 22.5° at Re = 230, referred to as N1 (Fig. 25a), and for AoA = 11° at Re = 245, referred to
as N2 (Fig. 25b). These test cases were strategically chosen to evaluate the capabilities of the proposed
methodology: the N1 task lies between two equispaced entries in the original database, while the N2
task corresponds to a prediction near an existing database value.

Figure 25: Same as Fig. 18 but for the generation of new databases for unseen flow conditions scenario.
The dots in red refer to the added unseen flow conditions, while the highlighted ones in black refer to
the target flow condition.

Figure 26 displays the predicted streamwise and normal velocity components for the N1 case. It
is evident that, for both velocity components, the high-resolution predictions accurately capture the
flow phenomena, closely matching the structures observed in the ground truth. Similar to the filled-in
data for incomplete databases, the MSE distribution remains close to zero over most of the domain,
with maximum errors occurring near the top and bottom of the bluff body for the streamwise velocity,
and in a localized region downstream of the bluff body for the normal velocity component.

The predictions obtained for the N2 test case are shown in Fig. 27. Similar to the N1 case, the
proposed HybriNet accurately captures the fluid dynamics phenomena. The flow structures for both
the streamwise and normal velocity components are precisely reconstructed in both the low- and high-
resolution predictions, demonstrating the ability of GPR to spatially upscale with high fidelity to the
original data. Regarding the MSE distribution, the maximum errors occur in the vicinity of the bluff
body for both velocity components.

Figures 28 and 29 show the evolution of the streamwise velocity magnitude at a point of interest

(x = 70, y = 80), located within the wake behind the square cylinder. For both test cases, the original
and predicted time series overlap closely over the snapshots corresponding to the test set (between
snapshots 106 and 128), indicating that the LSTM-based neural network was adequately trained on
the temporal coefficients associated with the retained temporal SVD modes.

4.6 Summary of the results obtained.

Table 6 presents the RRMSE computed for both the streamwise and normal velocity components across
the four test cases considered in this work. It can be observed that the FAoA case yields the lowest
error values for both velocity components, indicating that the proposed HybriNet effectively captures
variations related to changes in the angle of attack. In contrast, the FRe case exhibits the highest
RRMSE values, particularly for the streamwise component, suggesting that the model encounters
greater difficulty generalizing across different Reynolds numbers. For the N1 and N2 cases, the RRMSE

values lie between those of FRe and FAoA, with N1 showing slightly better performance than N2 in both
components. The streamwise velocity tends to exhibit higher reconstruction errors than the normal
velocity, likely due to the larger magnitude variations typically present in the streamwise direction.
It is worth mentioning that the RRMSE for both velocity components remains consistently below 2%
across all test cases, demonstrating the high accuracy and robustness of the proposed model.

5 Conclusions

To the best of the authors’ knowledge, HybridNet is introduced for the first time in this study as
a unified, modular framework that simultaneously addresses three critical tasks in fluid dynamics
modeling: parametric interpolation, temporal forecasting, and resolution enhancement. HybridNet
enables the generation of multi-parametric databases by interpolating across physical parameters, in
this case, angle of attack (AoA) and Reynolds number (Re), while extending its capabilities to produce
accurate temporal predictions and high-resolution reconstructions for both ground truth and predicted
data.

The results demonstrate that HybridNet delivers accurate reconstructions in both temporal and
parametric domains, as well as improved spatial resolution. Its modular architecture ensures flexibility
and generalizability, making it applicable to a wide range of databases where parametric variability,
spatio-temporal dynamics, and resolution limitations are key challenges.

The application of higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) facilitates effective dimen-
sionality reduction while preserving the most significant flow structures, thus enabling computationally
efficient data processing and storage. Coupling HOSVD with neural networks allows for spatial resolu-
tion enhancement by reconstructing high-resolution datasets from low-resolution inputs with minimal
error. Furthermore, Gaussian process regression (GPR) proves effective for interpolating new flow
conditions, such as intermediate Re numbers and AoA values, ensuring the continuity and consistency
of fluid dynamics databases.

Validation results confirm the accuracy and generalization capacity of the proposed framework, with
reconstruction errors consistently below 2% across all test cases. The forecasting module, based on
recurrent neural networks (RNNs), accurately predicts future flow states while preserving the coherence
of flow structures over time.

This hybrid deep learning multi-parametric reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework represents
a significant advancement in data-driven fluid dynamics analysis, offering a scalable, flexible, and
computationally efficient alternative to traditional high-fidelity simulations. Its modular design renders
it adaptable to diverse fluid dynamics scenarios, extending its applicability to complex flow problems
beyond the configurations examined in this work.
