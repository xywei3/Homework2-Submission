Solutions to the Einstein equations near the threshold of black hole formation exhibit remarkable
behavior known as critical phenomena gravitational collapse. In this work we perform characteristic
evolution in compactified Bondi coordinates in order to study the critical collapse of a Yang-Mills
field, allowing for the extraction of global quantities such as the Bondi mass and news function. Our
numerical approach is fourth-order accurate. First, we demonstrate that the collapsing field exhibits
local Discretely Self-Similar (DSS) behavior, characterized by an echoing period of A ~ 0.7388,
agreeing with previous works up to the second decimal place. We find that global quantities such as
the Bondi mass and news function display the same DSS behavior. We furthermore show that the
mass of the black holes formed during near-threshold evolutions scales as a function of the distance
to the critical parameter, with a critical exponent of approximately y = 0.1977 + 0.0009. Finally, our
findings indicate that these results are universal, irrespective of the initial data.

ar field is A ~ 3.44, in the Yang-
Mills field case, we have A ~ 0.7 [6]. At a practical
evel this means that the Yang-Mills field allows for a less
computationally demanding study of critical collapse.

The code developed is based on the solution of a
Characteristic Initial Value Problem (CIVP), in which the
initial data is specified on a null hypersurface. Our space-
ime is then foliated by a family of non-intersecting outgo-
ing null hypersurfaces. We compactify our domain in order
o include both the origin and future null-infinity 4+ in
our computational domain. Our motivation for this choice
of evolution is that it allows us to study the collapse from
he point of view of .%*, corresponding to an idealized
astrophysical observer. In this manner, our choice of nu-
merical setup allows us to study global quantities such
as the Bondi mass and the news function familiar from
discussions of gravitational waves in asymptotically flat
spacetimes.

Different aspects of the gravitational dynamics of a
Yang-Mills field have been studied with different con-
inuum formations and numerical approximations. For
instance, the system has been studied as a CIVP, with
an evolution based on compactified null hypersurfaces [7],
with a focus on the late-time behavior of subcritical evolu-
ions far from the critical regime. Again focusing on late-
ime tails, results have been presented using compactified
nyperboloidal evolution [8]. In their setup the foliation is
spacelike but leaves nevertheless terminate at %*. Criti-
cal collapse with the model was first studied in [4] is) using
a Cauchy formulation. Building on B], critical collapse
of a Yang-Mills field has been examined in [10) with a
hyperboloidal foliation, with a particular focus on type-
III collapse, a rare finding in which the two final-states
on both sides of the threshold are black holes, but the
Yang-Mills field is in different vacuum states. The state-
of-the-art was provided in Schwarzschild-like coordinates
by [5]. For the type-II collapse of the magnetic ansatz,
hey find a critical exponent of ~ = 0.19714+ 0.00074 and
an echoing period of A = 0.7364 + 0.0007 which, we will
see, are compatible with our findings.

In [11], the threshold o

collapse for two interacting
spherical fields, a massless scalar field and a Yang-Mills
field, was studied. Based on numerical results the exis-
tence of a “quasi-discretely self-similar” solution shared by
the two fields was conjectured. Empirically this solution
is equal to the Choptuik solution at infinitely small scales
and the type-II Yang-Mills critical solution at large scales,
with a gradual transition from one to the other. This
work employs the use of single-null coordinates, but in
an non-compactified domain, not allowing for radiation
studies at Zt.

Using a complementary strategy to the hyperboloidal
approach, global aspects of critical collapse of a scalar field
were studied in [12]. A self-gravitating massless scalar
field in spherical symmetry was evolved numerically with
a characteristic formulation, using a compactified grid
and thus including .7* in the computational domain.

In view of the above, in this work we follow the formula-
tion of [12] but make adjustments to achieve fourth-order

accuracy on compactified null-slices, which allows efficient
computation of radiative quantities at .7+. The novelty
consists of the combination of a characteristic formulation
and the study of the radiation emitted during a Yang-Mills
field collapse. The advantage is not only that it allows
for the study of .%*, but also the fact that the evolution
equations, at least in the spherical setting, are much sim-
pler than in other formulations such as hyperboloidal or
Cauchy. The study of solutions close to criticality then
becomes very computationally efficient, allowing for a
more straightforward tuning to the critical solution. A
characteristic approach also simplifies the study of the
causal structure of our solution and, as observed in [13]
can be used to side-step the need for mesh refinement.
Recent further discussion of characteristic formulations
can be found in [14].

The paper is organized as follows. In section [II] we
present our formulation the field equations. In section [IT]
we presents our numerical approach. Our results concern-
ing critical collapse are presented in section[IV] Finally, we
conclude in section [V] Geometric units are used through-
out.

II. CONTINUUM MODEL

In this study we focus on the threshold of collapse of
a purely magnetic SU(2) Yang-Mills field in spherical
symmetry. We begin in this section by formulating the
equations of motion for this model along the lines of [10)

i.

Our work differs from these as we consider a charac-
teristic foliation of spacetime with compactified Bondi
coordinates, as opposed to the non-compactified form used
in [1] or the hyperboloidal evolution of [10] [15]. Ulti-
mately this has the advantage that we do not need to solve
constraints for initial data but can resolve the dynamics
out to infinity. Our continuum model follows the charac-
teristic formulation of GR previously used in [12] to study
the collapse of a massless scalar field. Their work uses
compactified Bondi coordinates, which simplifies the study
of the region close to the center of spherical symmetry.
Their approach allows for the study of the gravitational
collapse from the point of view of an observer at future
null-infinity, which we now utilize to study the collapse
of a purely magnetic SU(2) Yang-Mills field. Since the
period of the critical solution is significantly smaller in
comparison with that of the massless scalar field, we are
able to calculate nearby solutions accurately without the
use of either mesh-refinement or infalling coordinates with
regridding. Our adjustments to the numerical approach
of [12] are discussed below in section

A. Geometry

The line element in Bondi coordinates {u,r,,¢} is of
the form

ds? = — e287) WAG), ®) du? — 2628") dudr
+r?(d6? + sin? 6d¢?),

in which 8(u,r) and V(r) are smooth metric functions.

Our gauge choice will be such that our outgoing null

slices are parameterized by the proper time of an observer

located at the origin, where the strong field dynamics are

happening.

In order to obtain a fully regular system of evolution

equations, we work with the Misner-Sharp mass func-

ion (3). In this way, we eliminate V by using

m(u,r) = : : = ve] . (3)

n numerical studies of GR, it is often useful to perform a
compactification of the radial coordinate r. We perform
a coordinate transformation which maps a half-line [0, 00)
0 a finite segment [0,1], according to

(4)

Points at %+ are then included in our grid at x = 1. In
such a manner, we can simulate observers at null-infinity
which will allow us to extract global properties of our
roblem.

B. Yang-Mills Field Collapse

As in [II], the purely magnetic Yang-Mills field in
spherical symmetry can be parametrized as

F =dW A (71d6 + 72 sin 0d¢) — (1 — W?)r3d0 A sin Odd,
(5)
where 7; are the Pauli matrices with tr(7;7;) = ;;. (See
also [4], which used a similar parametrization to study
the critical collapse of a Yang-Mills field in Cauchy co-
ordinates.) In the presence of a Yang-Mills field W the
Einstein Equations are

‘We can then use Equation ( to perform our time evolu-
tion and find our field W on slices of constant u. In fact,
we introduce a parametrization for W such that we regu-
larize Equation (i). An appropriate ansatz for W [4 [1]

is given by

in which x(u, x) = O(1) both at the origin and at .%*. To
make the numerical implementation more straightforward,
we define a new variable €(u, 7) = 27(u, 2).

Our final evolution system of equations is then com-
posed of two Einstein equations (3 and the wave equation
originating from W (i). regularized by the parametriza-

tion given by (2).

C. Asymptotic Quantities

We now define the radiation quantities at %* for the
collapse, namely the Bondi mass and the news function.

1. Bondi Mass

If we define the total energy enclosed by a surface, this
energy definition is said to be quasilocal. The Misner-
Sharp mass, given by Equation is one such quantity.

On the other hand, the Bondi mass is a global mass
definition for asymptotically flat spacetimes. It captures
he mass that remains on a null hypersurface of constant wu,
and is defined as

M(u) = Jim (0,7) eeonse: (13)

Because this hypersurface doesn’t intersect any of the
radiation emitted prior to the retarded time u, it turns
out that the Bondi mass can only decrease with increasing
retarded time uw. For instance, in an isolated system,
outgoing waves can radiate physical energy to .%+. The
Einstein equation in {rr} gives us an expression for the
mass change that can be written as

My, = he ?F py? Tule)
+8ar (r — 2m) Tur(u,r) (14)
—2re?8 (r — 2m)? T,,.(u, 1).

Equation is valid for a general matter model in
spherical symmetry. For the case of a Yang-Mills field,
the mass loss formula at .%* is simply

Ma = —8mre 2 2 (15)

su?

in which wu is equal to the central time uc. We can con-
clude that the Bondi mass is in general not conserved,
being monotonically decreasing in u. This is as expected
physically since no mass can enter our compactified do-
main.

2. News Function

The news function N(w) is a quantity related to the
emission of energy momentum through .%+. The Bondi
mass-loss equation provides a relation between N(u) and
the Bondi mass M(u) [7]. It can be written as

e72H (uc) dM (uc)
“ duc

in which H = B(uc,0o). As discussed in [16], H is related
o the redshift. It can be argued that if H — oo, then a
finite amount of central time uc corresponds to an infinite
amount of time ug (see Equation (17)). This means that
ight rays being emitted from the center are infinitely
redshifted.

We denote the Bondi time by wg. In [16], it is shown
hat the relation between central and Bondi time in the
imit r — oo is

= —4nN?(uc), (16)

dup =e?" duc. (17)

Using the mass loss formula we derived for the Yang-Mills
system and the Bondi mass-loss Equation (6),
find an expression for the News at .7+ for the case of this
hysical system

we

N(ug) = Vue: (18)

This can be translated onto Bondi time as

N(ug) = V2e7" Eu. (19)

Ill. NUMERICAL METHOD

As in [12] we solve the CIVP numerically, meaning that
we use a null foliation of spacetime and specify our initial
data on a hypersurface of constant u. The main difference
here, besides the fact that they study a scalar field criti-
cal collapse, is that we use a different integration scheme.
Piirrer et al. [12] integrate over a null parallelogram, devel-
oping a code based on a Diamond Integral Characteristic
Evolution [17]. We instead use a Runge-Kutta integrator
for both the time u and space x integrations, which are
done separately. Our integration scheme is straightfor-
ward to apply and has the advantage of being globally
fourth-order accurate. We started by implementing a
second-order accurate method and found, somewhat un-
surprisingly, that our results improved substantially once
we upgraded to fourth-order accuracy. Derivatives were
approximated using a fourth-order finite difference scheme
given by

(20)

At the first and second gridpoints of our grid, our finite
difference operator is not defined, thus we need to use
a different stencil, lopsided by two and one gridpoints
respectively, and we need to make sure that the error
terms match. Following [18], we use lopsided derivative
operators, which are found to be

which have the same leading error as Equation (20). We
use Kreiss-Oliger dissipation to damp the formation of
high frequency modes.

Julia, Python and Mathematica files) can be found at

the GitHub repository

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

We implemented the evolution system of equations (3
and (11) as derived in Section
begin with a description of given data and diagnostics,
before briefly presenting a representative validation test
and finally moving on to discuss our physical results.

A. Initial Data and Diagnostics

We construct initial data families for € that are
Gaussian-like:

&(uo, x) = Ar(x) exp - (ea (22)

We fix ro = 0.3 and o = 0.1, and study the influence of
changing the amplitude A, our tuning parameter.

The critical solution is parameterized by a critical am-
litude A = A, which determines the separation between
wo different scenarios in parameter space: supercriti-
cal solutions, which correspond to black hole formation,
and subcritical evolutions, in which the initial data even-
ually disperses to flat spacetime. We find the critical
amplitude that produces such evolutions by performing
a bisection search in the parameter A. From each bi-
section, we extract relevant quantities of critical solu-
ions, such as the self-similarity echoing period A and the
accumulation time u,. For a near-critical solution, the
approximate value of the accumulation time defines an ap-
roximate location (advanced time) of the Self-Similarity
Horizon (SSH).

In practice, we detect the formation of an apparent
10rizon by monitoring the value of the compactness 2m/r
hroughout the evolution, with 2m/r = 1 signifying the
presence of an apparent horizon. In our particular null
coordinates, our slices do not penetrate apparent horizons.
Therefore, we soften the condition by using 2m/r > 0.71
as the condition to mark evolutions as supercritical, as
is common practice. We have adjusted the specific value
chosen for this criteria and find that within some range
this has little effect on the outcome.

Evolutions closer to criticality are required to ‘slow
down’ according to a Self-Similarity Horizon (CFL)-type
condition, which is a condition that guarantees that the
full numerical domain of dependence contains the physical
domain of dependence. This condition can be written as

C= <1, (23)

in which C is the Courant number and v =
value of v can be obtained from Equation
dé = dd = 0, and can be rewritten in terms of m and x
as

dx (1- x)3e?9 (2m/x i)
du 2 ,

We start the evolution with Au = 0.5 Ax, updating Au

at each iteration according to Au = 0.5 Ax (22) This
ensures that the distance any information travels during
a timestep At must be smaller than the distance between
mesh elements (Az). Our scheme is not strictly causal but
this poses no difficulties beyond this (expected) restriction
on the timestep.

As we tune closer to A, our solutions are expected

to exhibit critical behavior. One of the characteristics is

FIG. 1. Convergence factor Q(u) throughout the evolution,
using a code that is fourth-order accurate. The dotted and
solid lines correspond to a grid with 100 and 200 points at
the lower resolution, respectively. We see that as we increase
resolution, Q gets closer to 2. The initial data is constructed
using Equation 2. and setting A = 0.01, ro = 0.3 and o =
0.08. We stop the convergence test when the magnitude of
all fields is smaller than 10~*. We use a lower resolution here
than in our near-critical runs, but as we increase resolution
and data strength, the solution converges in a similar manner.

discrete self-similarity of the collapsing field solution. This
self-similarity is characterized by an echoing period A,
which we will extract from our evolutions.

Based on our Bondi coordinates {u,r,6,¢}, we define
the specific DSS-adapted time coordinate as

T = —In(u, — u), (25)

where u is the proper time at the origin, and u, is the
the accumulation time, at which the curvature diverges
in the limit of infinite tuning to the threshold. T is then
what we will call the similarity time, which is defined for
a constant u,» > 0 and u < uy [19].

The accumulation time u, can be estimated by tak-
ing two pairs of consecutive zero-crossings of the magni-
tude of the collapsing field at the origin, (un,un41) and
(Umstm41). Assuming that each pair differs in half of the
period A/4, we can solve for the accumulation time [19]
obtaining

UnUm+1 — Un+1Um

Un — Un+1 — Um + Um+1

The same reasoning can be applied to provide an esti-
mate for the echoing period A [19] resulting in

A=2In (2). (27)

Ux — Un+1

Each self-similar repetition of the solution at progressively
smaller scales is referred to as an echo.

B. Convergence Tests

To validate our numerical solutions we perform conver-
gence tests. We compute the solution f at three different

resolutions A;, Ao, and A3, with A3 = A)/2 = A,/4.

The convergence factor Q is defined as Q(u) = emda
2— tas

with ||-|| a discrete approximation to the L? norm, which
we evaluate throughout the evolution for each variable
separately, as shown in the left panel of Figur Since
all the numerical methods we implement are fourth-order
accurate, we expect Q to remain close to ~ 4 through-
out the evolution. Global zero-crossings of a particular
variable cause jumps in the apparent convergence rates,
and so a more informative plot is given by the overall
code convergence rate, obtained by computing the norm
taking into account all the variables together, which is
shown on the right panel of the same figure. We stop the
convergence test once the variables disperse and get to
values close to the numerical precision, which happens
at u = 1.0. At this point, we can no longer trust the
computed convergence factor. In Figure [I] we see that
as we increase resolution the convergence factor Q gets
closer to~ 4, indicating good fourth-order convergence as
desired.

C. Identification of Critical Behavior

We now turn to analyze different evolution regimes of
a Yang-Mills field collapse. As an illustrative example, in
Figure [2] we present the field €(u, x) for both subcritical
and supercritical initial data. We see that the subcritical
evolution disperses completely at the end of the evolution
whereas the supercritical evolution stops at earlier times,
when our compactness criteria is met. To close in on the
threshold of collapse we perform bisection searches, as is
common, for grid setups with different resolutions. The
results of our bisections are summarized in Table
Regarding the results shown in Tab. e [I] we first notice
hat the critical parameters obtained for each resolution
are consistent. Using Equation (27), we estimate an
echoing period of A = 0.73. At the continuum level,
here’s one single critical amplitude value. However, the
numerical error depends on the resolution considered, so
as we use more gridpoints, the runs become more accurate
(in practice, ‘less dissipative’) and we are better able to
oetter resolve runs with stronger initial data.

FIG. 2. € = W — 1 throughout the evolution. The top panel
shows a subcritical evolution with initial amplitude A = 0.001
and the lower a supercritical evolution with A = 0.089 for
N = 400. For clarity only a subset of the data points are
shown.

In [6] perturbative arguments are used to calculate
the echoing period, and it is found that A = 0.73784 +
0.00002, consistent with the value we report in Table
Additionally, the work of [5] estimates a value of A =
0.7364 + 0.0007, and [4] estimates A = 0.74. The error
estimation here is non-trivial as there is both numerical
error and also error from the method used to estimate A,
so that it is easy to underestimate the error associated
in these estimates. Nevertheless, the results we pointed
out are consistent with our findings, despite using very
different continuum and numerical setups.

In the next subsections we discuss local and global
self-similarity of critical solutions, then black hole mass
scaling and finally present evidence that our results are
universal with respect to initial data.

D. DSS Behaviour in Local and Global Quantities

In this section, we investigate how local and global
quantities behave in evolutions that approach the critical
solution. Following [IT], we observe that x (recalling that
W =1+27y =1+€) is not compatible with exact DSS.
The critical solution observed should instead be of the
form

x= e Tx, (28)

where T is the similarity time.

We perform a bisection search with N = 6 - 10° points
and find a critical amplitude of A, = 0.088640995, tuned
o 9 decimal places. We find that, for this resolution,
further tuning our solution did not improve the number of
echoes observed. Observe This result is achieved without
he use of mesh refinement. In Figure] we show the value
of X¥ at the origin as a function of proper time wu and of
similarity time T, for our best tuned run. We see that
indeed ¥ is DSS with an echoing period of A ¥ 0.737.

Although we can observe a significant number of echoes
or the Yang-Mills field without using mesh refinement,
his is much more difficult for the scalar field collapse,
as the echoing period is around five times larger in that
case.

The shape we find of the solutions near-criticality agrees
with the picture found in previous works, that the features
of critical solutions in a region around the origin {4} [5]. Our
main goal is, however, to inspect these features at %+.

In fact, the SSH is the past light cone of the accumula-
ion time. Hence, it is the region of spacetime where we
expect that the solution is self-similar. Moreover, since
we are using a characteristic foliation of spacetime, we
are able to show that the dynamics of the critical solu-
ion, and particularly discrete self-similarity, are radiated
o %*. This is shown in Figure|4] where the news func-
ion is plotted. An observer at .4~ is then able to observe
eatures of critical collapse. These are imprinted also in
he Bondi mass, the other asymptotic quantity discussed
in Section

To summarize, our near-critical solutions share the
same universal features as the critical solution, both at
the origin and at .%*. Lastly, our parameter estimates
are consistent with those from previous numerical works
and with the perturbative results of [6].

E. Black Hole Mass and Curvature Scaling

As discussed in Section [I] the mass of the black holes
formed in evolutions that are barely supercritical has been
found to follow a power-law described by Equation (.
For the case of the spherical Yang-Mills, this scaling
has been derived by perturbing the critical solution [6],
yielding a critical exponent of 7 = 0.1964 + 0.0007.

In this Section, we restrict ourselves to the criti-
cal solution previously obtained for 4 - 10? gridpoints,
with A, = 0.088640996, as shown in Table [I] In Figure[7]
we plot the values of the estimate mass of the black hole,
as a function of the distance to the critical parameter.
We fit the data present in Figure with an
ansatz In(mpy) = yIn(A — Ax)+b (see Equation (i) and
find that the final black hole mass scales as In(mpy) =
0.1977 In(A — A.) — 1.6171. We then extract a critical ex-
ponent of 7 = 0.1977. This value is again compatible with
that from perturbation theory in [6], but and also with the
values estimated in earlier numerical studies. In particu-
lar [5] finds an exponent y = 0.19714 + 0.00074, and [4]
estimates 7 = 0.20, both using Cauchy formulations.

This same scaling behavior happens for barely sub-
critical evolutions. In this scenario, we compute the
maximum value of T,,)T#?, which is a proxy for the max-

this quantity as a function of the distance to A,, and ex-
tract a scaling law of In(mpy) ~ 0.197 In(A — A.) —8.263,
with y = 0.197+0.002. This exponent is consistent within
errors with the 7 extracted from supercritical evolutions,
as well as with those from [4] [6] and [5]. In Figure [9] we
plot the same data from Figure} but with the linear fit
subtracted, revealing the underlying periodic behavior.

We recall that the values of the black hole masses are
estimated by taking the value of the Misner-Sharp mass
at the gridpoint in which the compactness reaches our
criterion to mark an evolution as supercritical, without
interpolation between gridpoints. In fact, assuming the

same run as Figure B] We find that the Bondi mass in the
last time step of this evolution (Tr) is mg,r, = 1.9 * 10°
mp(t = 0). The right panel shows a zoom-in of the region
where the periodicity is visible. The vertical lines are spaced
in 0.73, which is approximately the same value we calculate
for A.

Cosmic Censorship Conjecture holds true, there will still
be mass-energy left outside of the compactness peak that
will later fall through the horizon, and thus this estimate
will indeed not correspond to the true final black hole mass.
This, together we the fact that we do not interpolate to
estimate mgu, could wash out fine structure, which may
explain why we do not see the periodic behavior on the
supercritical side in Figure [7] Nevertheless, this approach
is sufficient to observe the scaling as predicted with per-
urbation theory, with a critical exponent y = 0.1977, in
agreement with theoretical computations and numerical
estimations from previous works. If we take the closest
simulation to the critical solution on the supercritical side,
we can get an estimate of the smallest black hole we can
uild for this family of initial data, at this resolution. We
find that the smallest black hole is 2.75% of the initial
Bondi mass in that evolution. At the time the horizon
forms, about 71% of the Bondi mass is contained within
he Black Hole.

F. Bondi Mass Decay

As discussed in Section the Bondi mass is an
asymptotic quantity which measure the total mass present
on an outgoing null hypersurface. We also observe this
global quantity to be DSS (see Figure , and thus
features of the critical collapse which happen around the
center of spherical symmetry are radiated towards future
null infinity. In fact, the period at which the Bondi mass
is shown to decay is approximately the same as the one
which is estimated for the echoing around the region of
the center of the collapse.

The mass loss 0,,(mp) at %* throughout the evolution
is expressed by Equation , which was obtained from
the {r,r} Einstein equation, combined with our m and
8 hypersurface equations. In Figure we plot the

FIG. 11. We compare the mass loss at .%* for the Yang-Mills

using a derived equation for the mass loss at 4+. The data
here presented corresponds to the same run as Figure]

numerical results obtained by taking a time derivative
of the variable m, computed with our numerical scheme,
along the value we obtain analytically from the Einstein
equations. We see that these values correspond almost
exactly to the analytical expected result.

This is in fact a non-trivial test of our numerical scheme
since we don’t directly solve all Einstein equations, and
in particular we don’t solve equation (15). Instead, we
calculate m in slices of constant u by integrating out
an expression that depends on the remaining evolution
variables. This provides additional evidence that our
results and implementation are valid.

G. Universality

So far, we have been studying families of initial data
that are described by Equation (22), in which we fix rg =
0.3 and o = 0.1. We have studied the influence of chang-
ing the amplitude A and fine-tuning to its critical value A...
We now study the collapse of different families of initial
data, in particular by considering initial data with differ-
ent o and rp values. For several combinations of {0,79}
values, we performed a bisection search to find the criti-
cal amplitude, and the associated power-law and scaling
period parameters. These are shown in Tab. e [IT]

As expected, runs with initial data that is more local-
ized (with smaller 7) have a smaller accumulation time,
meaning that the apparent horizon starts to form at an
earlier time in the evolution. Moreover, the critical ampli-
tude is smaller in the evolutions with denser initial data.
We obtain the same picture as in the Section|I
threshold solutions characterized by the same echoing
period A, despite using different initial data. This gives
supporting evidence that, regardless of the initial data
profile, a near-critical solution will ‘lose’ its features along
the evolution and approach the critical solution.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we examined the critical collapse of Yang-
Mills field using a null foliation of spacetime in spherical
symmetry with a purely magnetic ansatz. Our main goals
were to use a formulation that would allow the study
of this process from the point of view of an observer
located at future null infinity and to achieve fourth-order
accuracy. This allowed for the computation of radiation
quantities, and was achieved by virtue of compactified
Bondi coordinates.

The evolutions that are near-critical exhibit features
of the critical solution of the Yang-Mills field. They are
‘ound to be DSS with an echoing period of A = 0.7388.
n barely supercritical evolutions, the mass of the black
holes formed was shown to follow a power-law in relation
o the distance to the critical parameter. This relation
is characterized by a critical exponent of y = 0.1977 in
agreement with earlier work. We also presented evidence
hat near the threshold of collapse, all solutions approach
he critical solution, which is thus universal.

The critical parameters estimated are not only consis-
ent with the computations of [6], but also agree with pre-
vious numerical works that were restricted to the strong
field region. Our key finding is that, as in the case of
scalar field collapse, known features of the critical solution
in the strong-field region, such as the echoing period A,
are inherited at future null infinity.

Possible future directions consist in exploring dropping
he magnetic ansatz to investigate all the degrees of free-
dom of the Yang-Mills connection in spherical symmetry,
as explored in [5] with null infinity. Another promising
direction would be to drop spherical symmetry, as has
been done for scalar fields in [[9}23]. The study of as-
herical perturbations of spherical critical solutions from
a matter model with a small echoing period is desirable,
as it is easier to study perturbations given many periods
of periodic data. This will most likely yield more accu-
rate results than using a scalar field, as one needs much
less resolution to observe the same critical phenomena.
Recent work [14] presents a roadmap for critical collapse
simulations in null coordinates of nonspherical data, and
he treatment by Cauchy evolution could be performed

10

with more common methods.

Moreover, a limitation of our work consists in the fac
hat we use compactified Bondi coordinates which become
singular at the event horizon. In this way, we are limited
o the spacetime exterior to black hole formation. Since
we focus on the spherically symmetric case, the horizon
orms simultaneously in all radial null directions from the
center of collapse. However, in the collapse of nonspherica
initial data, the horizon forms at different retarded times
or different angles. Thus, for data that is not spherically
symmetric, it could be helpful to use a formulation tha’
can penetrate horizons. In [24], for example, an evolution
algorithm is presented for the CIVP based upon an affine
parameter rather than the areal radial coordinate, which
is potentially applicable to the entire exterior spacetime
extending additionally to the interior of the black hole.
The use of carefully chosen coordinates may not only
allow for the study of the collapse of non-spherically
symmetric data, but also help advance the study of the
scaling quantities within barely supercritical simulations.
In closing, our results show that the standard picture
of critical collapse for the Yang-Mills field in spherical
symmetry is indeed observable at future null infinity, and
that the features of the critical solution are preserved in
this region of spacetime.
