We investigate how matter density distributions affect thin-wall bubble formation in the
asymmetron mechanism, a scalar-tensor theory with a universal coupling to matter and ex-
plicit symmetry-breaking, and analyse the stability of its metastable state. We show that
the screening mechanism of the asymmetron inside dense objects induces a surface tension
associated with the boundary of the screening object, leading to a richer class of bubble solu-

tions than the standard Coleman—Callan bulk nucleation. These boundary surface tensions

are used to modify the Nambu-Goto action for instantons, allowing for the computation

of the corresponding Euclidean action for bubbles nucleating on flat planes, as well as on

concave and convex cylindrical surfaces. We find that the smallest Euclidean action occurs
for bubbles nucleating along the edge of a concave spherical surface. Comparing this edge
nucleation channel with the bulk one, we determine the maximum curvature radius for which
concave edge nucleation is preferred. Since the maximum radius of curvature is exponentially
suppressed by the action of a bulk bubble, we find that within the regime of the instanton
approximation, edge nucleation is always preferred. This is largely due to the weak cou-

plings of the asymmetron. We apply these findings to determine the maximum curvature

radius of a cosmic void and discuss how our results affect the seeding of N-body simulations

of asymmetron domains, showing that domain wall nucleation preferentially occurs at the

edges of cosmological voids. We also demonstrate that the presence of a homogeneous gas
around the dense substrates reduces the maximum curvature radius, enabling bulk bubbles

to form preferentially as the asymmetron undergoes a density-driven phase transition.
I. INTRODUCTION

The dynamics of scalar fields in the early Universe provide essential insights into cosmological
phase transitions [I], vacuum stability 2H5] and the origin of cosmic structure [6}H8]. In particular,
non-perturbative Euclidean solutions of the field equations, known as instantons [9] [10], describe

tunnelling from a metastable vacuum to the true vacuum of a theory.

A well-studied application of scalar fields in Cosmology is the symmetron mechanism introduced
in Ref [II], a scalar-tensor theory in which the scalar has a bare symmetry-breaking potential. In
the Einstein frame, the scalar is minimally coupled to gravity, while in the Jordan frame, it couples
universally to Standard Model matter fields. The presence of matter shifts the effective mass of
the symmetron at the origin, making it tachyonic in low-density environments and real in regions
of high density. Consequently, the effective potential has a single minimum in the high-density
environment of the early Universe, but as the matter density redshifts below a critical density,
the Zz symmetry spontaneously breaks and the potential develops two minima [12]. As the scalar
rolls into the different minima in distinct patches of the Universe, a domain wall network forms.
A crucial feature of the symmetron in the cosmological picture is that it delays the formation of
domain walls to a redshift of z ~ 1, as mentioned in Ref [12], which prevents the energy density of
the Universe from becoming dominated by the domain wall network during the inflationary epoch

{13} [14], which ensures the symmetron model is consistent with current cosmological observations

in Ref [5].

The more general asymmetron potential [I6}HI8] introduces a cubic term that explicitly breaks
the Z 2 symmetry of the bare potential. The effective potential features false and true vacua
2). As in the symmetron, the onset of symmetry-breaking at low densities generates domains
separated by unstable walls [16]. The pressure difference from the true domain onto the false domain
destabilises the network. The earliest systematic treatment of metastable decay was given by
J. S. Langer in Ref. [20], who developed the theory of nucleation of first-order phase transitions
in thermodynamic systems. Building on the world of Langer, Coleman and Callan [2] [3] established
the semiclassical method for computing the associated decay rate, which remains a cornerstone of
modern studies of vacuum stability. A pedagogical review of false vacuum decay and modern

applications beyond bubble nucleation can be found in Ref. [2]].
Recently, there has been a rise in interest in seeding false vacuum decay in analogue condensed
matter systems [23]. Semiclassical analyses suggest that nucleation may be enhanced at bound-
aries, such as the edge of a cylindrical substrate [22]. However, Ref. [23]|24] argues that for analogue
experiments to faithfully mimic cosmological tunnelling, boundary effects, such as bubble nucle-
ation on the interior edge of a spherical chamber, should be suppressed, since bubble nucleation in

the early Universe is a bulk process.

Seeded nucleation has also been considered in curved spacetimes. For example, the nucleation of
scalar bubbles around black holes in Schwarzschild-de-Sitter (SdS) spacetimes has been explored
in Refs. [25}{28]. In such settings, decay of the false vacuum acquires a thermal interpretation,
since the Euclidean continuation renders time compact [29], which induces a continuation of the
Euclidean action into a statistical thermal free energy of the scalar field. Additionally, spacetimes
with horizons, such as de Sitter space, have an associated temperature known as the Gibbons-
Hawking temperature [30]. However, spacetimes with multiple horizons, such as SdS, exhibit
different surface gravities, implying different temperatures; thus, a global thermal equilibrium is
absent, except in special cases, like the Nariai limit (where the temperatures of the cosmic and
black hole horizons are equal and constant [31]). While these studies neglect the quantum effects
of the black hole, such as black hole evaporation, the approximations can be justified on timescales

shorter than the horizon, where non-equilibrium effects are negligible.

In this work, we investigate how quantum fluctuations render the asymmetron false vacuum
metastable: the scalar field can tunnel through the barrier, nucleating a spherical bubble of true
vacuum. The decay rate is computed semiclassically from the Euclidean continuation of the path
integral [3] [4] [9] [10]. We extend the calculations of Coleman and Callan to discuss the role that
boundaries play in bubble nucleation. Unlike the discussion in Ref. [23] [24], boundary nucleation is
physically relevant here, since the explicit coupling of the asymmetron to dense astrophysical ob-
jects such as stars and the edges of galactic voids acts as an effective boundary for the scalar field.
This raises the question of whether bubble nucleation is enhanced on such geometries, and under

what conditions does edge nucleation dominate over bulk nucleation? Moreover, we are motivated

oy laboratory searches for symmetron-like fifth forces, which remain sensitive to parameter ranges

in which these effects could be tested [32] [33].

The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. In Sec. we use the Nambu-Goto instanton
action to calculate bubble nucleation rates in the presence of a constant background density. We
then expand this in Sec. [V]to bubbles nucleating on planar and cylindrical boundaries. We identify
convex and concave edge nucleation channels and show that concave edges minimise the Euclidean
action. In Sec. we compare bulk and edge decay rates, determine the maximum curvature
radius for which edge nucleation dominates, and apply this both to laboratory vacuum chamber

geometries and to cosmological settings such as galactic voids.

A. Universal Coupling of Scalars to Matter

1. The Symmetron Mechanism

The symmetron mechanism, first introduced in Ref. [II], is a screening mechanism for the addition
of scalar degrees of freedom in modified theories of gravity, known as scalar-tensor theories [34] [35].

The symmetron has the following action,
, 1 1

where g,, and g,, are respectively the Einstein and Jordan frame metrics, and R is the Ricci

(1)

scalar in the Einstein frame. Mp is the Planck mass in the Einstein frame. The first line in
Eq. (i), expressed in the Einstein frame, is familiar, as it describes the theory of a scalar field
that is minimally coupled to gravity. The second line is the action of the Standard Model, which
is manifestly expressed in the Jordan frame. The two metrics are related to each other by the

following Wey] transformation,

Guy = A?(0) guv- (2)

We can see that @ universally couples to all matter fields, w;, through the term Vo Ly, Gur):

FIG. 1: On the left, we show the symmetron effective potential from Eq. (sh. On the right, we
show the asymmetron effective potential Eq. with parameter choices (A, «) = (1,0.05). In
both cases, it is observed that for densities p < j:?2M?, the potentials exhibit symmetry breaking
and have two minima. We show the potential at the critical density p = u?M?, where it can be
seen that the potentials acquire a single minimum. For densities larger than p > ?M?, the
potentials have a single global minimum. However, the asymmetron potential exhibits explicit
symmetry breaking as the degeneracy-breaking in the potential in the right-hand figure is clear.
For both potentials, we have rescaled the scalar field by the VEV of the bare potential, ¢9, which
allows us to factorise out some of the parameter dependence of the potential, leading to the
prefactor, Ad6, by which we scale Veg(¢). In the symmetron case, this makes the potential only
dependent on the local matter density p. In the case of the asymmetron, however, the ratio «/A

contributes to the size of the explicit symmetry-breaking of the minima.

We will model the matter as a classical, pressure-free gas with density in the Jordan frame /, in

which case, T = —p. The corresponding Einstein frame density is given by, o = A?(¢)p, and thus,

the equation of motion for ¢ can then be written as,

_ d _ Wor
b= a4V + pA) = 58 (5)

where Veg(¢) is the effective potential. The bare symmetron potential, V(@), is chosen in Refs. [T2]
[32] [33] to be the discrete Z) symmetry-breaking potential given by,

1 ey
V(¢) = -5w¢? + <4" (6)
2 4
with minima given by ¢9 = tyr: where 1 is the mass parameter and A is the quartic dimensionless

coupling constant of the scalar. The symmetron is a theory for which we require the effective
potential to have a Z2 symmetry and correspondingly, the Weyl transformation is required to

respect the symmetry (¢ > —¢),

Ale) =14 5 +0(4) (7)
2M2 M4

where M is a cut-off scale that is introduced to ensure that A(¢) is dimensionless ({¢] = [J/]).
This choice also reflects the fact that when ¢ vanishes, one retrieves Einstein gravity. It should
be noted that the expansion in Eq. is valid for 6 < M as discussed in Ref. [36]. Thus, the

symmetron effective potential is given by,

Verr() = V(d) + pA(4)

1, P 2, Ao4

of ( ain)? a?

which is shown on the left-hand panel of FIG. The symmetron mechanism is an example of a

(8)

screening mechanism, which is defined as a coupling of the scalar field to its environment which
prevents the occurrence of long-range fifth forces. In the symmetron mechanism, the environment
is defined as the density distribution in spacetime. This explicit coupling to matter gives the

symmetron an effective mass parameter [Jeg defined by,

Pp
Hog = —1 (1 = fn) . (9)

The scalar mass in Eq. (9) is tachyonic (neg < 0) when p < p?M? resulting inl spontaneous
symmetry-breaking effects but, when p > ?M?, the mass parameter becomes real (u2¢ > 0) and
the Zz symmetry is restored. The spontaneous breakdown of symmetry in the symmetron model is
driven purely by fluctuations in the local density of matter p. The critical density of the symmetron
potential is p, = ?M?. We further define a region of subcritical matter density when p < p, and

a supercritical one when p > px.

The symmetron potential in Eq. admits domain wall solutions separating regions in distinct
vacua that resemble the Zz domain walls described in Ref. [14]. This is derived from the energy

functional, E[¢], defined as,

Bio) = [| 56 + 5079)? + Vente] av. (10)
We can use Bogomolnyi’s method in Ref. [14] [87] to find the explicit profile and the associated
energy. In three spatial dimensions (2, y, z), the infinite, static planar domain wall ¢ = ¢(z) parallel

to the xy-plane and centered at z = 0 is given by,

ole) = 40 (1 2) can |e (: 2)') (11)

When the density is supercritical, the domain walls vanish because the Zz symmetry of Vog(¢) is

fully restored, resulting in a trivial vacuum manifold of the potential. We define Lo = (V2) as
the Compton wavelength of the symmetron. The domain wall, ¢(z), carries a surface energy, o(p),
which is localised around the core of the domain wall, given by,

ato) = faz [5o(e) + Vato)|

where o = o(0) is the surface tension of the domain walls solution of the bare potential in Eq. (6.

discussed in Ref. [I4]. On scales much larger than Lo, the domain wall appears to be a thin,

(12)

(13)

flexible membrane, in which case, o(p) represents the surface tension, which is formally defined
as the differential energy input, dE’, required to increase the surface area of the domain wall by a

differential amount dA = dxdy.

For spatially-varying scalar field profiles, A(¢) contributes to a conservative potential for matter

particles, leading to a fifth force,
Fs = —V(In A). (14)

This is most clearly demonstrated by taking the geodesic equation of a particle in the Jordan
frame and expanding g,, using Eq. (7). which generates an additional tensorial term that survives
when one moves into a local inertial frame. The dynamics of ultra-cold atoms interacting with
symmetron domain walls in vacuum chamber experiments are discussed in Ref. [32], and there is
a great interest in developing experiments, as in Ref. [33], to test for the existence of fifth forces.
In high-density environments such as the solar system, the symmetron mechanism plays a crucial
role in hiding these fifth forces [38}{40]. Local solar system tests constrain the parameter space (ju,
A, M) of the symmetron such that the critical density is lower than the density of the solar system
[33]. This means that the effects of these fifth forces should be below the sensitivity of current

experimental tests of the Strong Equivalence Principle (SEP).
2. The Asymmetron Potential: Explicitly Breaking the Symmetron Degeneracy

To construct an effective potential with explicit symmetry-breaking, one can either modify the bare

potential V(@) in Eq. and/or the Wey] factor A(@) in Eq.

(7). These modifications define a
landscape of models with varied phenomenology. However, we are interested in a symmetron-like
effective potential that exhibits explicit symmetry breaking of the minima in low-density environ-

ments. Consider the addition of a cubic term in A(¢) such as,

¢ e
aa hae (15)

A(o) =1+
breaking the Zz symmetry in the Weyl factor. This generates T-weighted corrections in the effective
potential (e.g p¢3/K) and spoils the screening mechanism in high-density regions. Essentially,
one would measure a non-zero scalar field value in regions of high density; therefore, the scalar
asymmetron would register a fifth force that cannot be hidden from local solar system experiments.
Higher-order odd terms would exacerbate the problem, resulting in an unbounded potential at large
field values. Thus, we prefer to introduce a cubic term to the bare potential V(¢). This can be
done most directly by adding a linear or cubic term to V(¢) without further modifications. Within
the bare potential, it is always possible to remove a linear term by a shift ¢ + @+ constant,
at the expense of modifying the coefficients of the quadratic and cubic terms. Considering our
asymmetron to be a low-energy effective theory, we avoid quintic or higher-order terms, which are
non-renormalizable or irrelevant in that their coefficients run to zero at low energies. We note that
theories that derive from rescaling the metric, such as the Weyl transformation, will necessarily
contain non-renormalizable operators. In the context of the Higgs metastability, which is induced
by renormalisation group running, such non-renormalisable operators have been shown to have a
sizeable influence on the decay rate and even on the existence of metastability [41}43]. However,
if metastability is present already in the tree-level potential, the effects of such non-renormalizable
operators are expected to be smaller. We follow Refs. [16] [I7] in adopting a cubic deformation of

the bare potential V(),

V(b) = — 516? + Fo!

where « is a dimensionless parameter such that k < X, ¢o is the VEV of the potential in Eq. (6)

and is introduced in the coupling to make « dimensionless. Thus, we build the following effective

potential for the asymmetron,

1 nN
Ver(d) = — 51° (: duit) + ot — OR gs (17)
shown in the right-hand panel of FIG. Several properties of the asymmetron potential can be

calculated exactly. We define a convenient factor A,

2, _1,__?P KY?
A%(K,p) =1 pum (ox) (18)

which appears frequently. The potential minima can be expressed as,

+ = $0 [5 + A(«,p)| ; (19)

where $4 is the true vacuum (global minimum) of Veg(¢) and ¢~ is the false vacuum (local
minimum), both of which are classically stable equilibrium states. The critical density discussed

earlier also receives a correction from this cubic term,

pe = PM? (14+ ca 5 (20)
Ay? ]?

Since O(x?) terms are sub-leading, we will ignore them in the subsequent analysis; however, we

shall acknowledge the existence of such corrections when they appear in important expressions.

The energy difference between the vacua is given by,

AV = Vea(—) — Ver(o4) = eA. (21)

We denote the value of AV for p= 0 andk <A bye = 2 and the leading-order contribution
is given by AV =e+ O(K?). The masses of small fluctuations around either vacua are given by,

Am=m,—m_=0O (m x =) :

Furthermore, we define the Compton wavelengths around each minimum, L+ = ml.

B. Vacuum Decay

The early work of Langer in Refs. established a framework for investigating the behaviour

of thermal systems exhibiting metastable states. This was built upon by Coleman and Callan in
10

Refs. [2)[3], to describe the behaviour of a zero-temperature quantum field theory system exhibiting
explicitly-broken symmetry as discussed in Section [ITA 2} In essence, they provide a generalisation
of the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation to quantum field theory, yielding non-
trivial semiclassical amplitudes associated with tunnelling processes. A detailed account of the

mathematical framework of instanton calculations can be found in Refs. [9] [IO].

In the WKB methods for transitions between vacua of a potential ¢; — ¢¢ in a scalar field theory,

one encounters the Euclideanized path integral given by,

(ore Io) =" [ Does (—5°)) (24)

where WV is an appropriately chosen normalisation constant. An instanton is a classical solution to
the Euclidean equations of motion, derived from the Euclidean action, Sz, which itself is obtained
by analytically continuing real time, t, to imaginary time 7, via a Wick rotation, t + —ir (see

Ref. [9 [10)),

54\2
Here, (0,,¢)(O.¢) = (3) +(V)? such that repeated indices downstairs are understood to mean
asum under a Euclidean signature and V refers to the spatial components of the gradient operator.

The Euler-Lagrange equation is given by,

Oo _ dV

On = aut Vo= ie (26)

where V (¢) is a potential with an explicitly broken symmetry as with Eq. (16). The solution to this
equation of motion, with appropriate boundary conditions, is the instanton. The path integral in
Eq. can be evaluated using the saddle-point approximation, in which we expand the Euclidean

action to second order around the instanton (the saddle-point of the Euclidean action),

where ¢, are the normalised eigenfunctions of the second order fluctuation operator Si4[¢] =

—$[0,0), + Vei-(p)]@ around the bounce and £,, are their corresponding eigenvalues.

It is shown in Ref. [44] that in D dimensions, a scalar field obeying the equation of motion in

Eq. (26), the solution is O(D) symmetric. In Refs. [2] [10] this spherically symmetric solution is
11

called the bounce, ¢4(x), where y? = 77+ ean x? is the radial displacement from the origin. The

Euclidean action of the O(4)-symmetric solution of Eq. can be expressed as,

In four Euclidean dimensions, the equation of motion is given by,

Cola) fs 3d¢_ dv

This resembles Newton’s second law for a scalar field rolling down the inverted potential V with a

(29)

drag term inversely proportional to vy. One often resorts to using the thin-wall approximation to
solve equations of this form [2] 45]. The influence of the drag term is to force the scalar to remain
near the true vacuum over a scale comparable to a radial distance R < Lo. Then, ¢@ quickly
rolls down the potential valley over a width that is much smaller than R and quickly comes to
rest on the false vacuum. One can use numerical methods to solve such equations away from the
thin-wall approximation [46] 47]. Ref. discusses a perturbation series method to determine the
bounce solution and its Euclidean action away from the thin-wall approximation using a quantity

analogous to & as an expansion parameter.

For a small energy difference between minima, k < A, the bounce is approximately given by,

On this scale, the bounce has Euclidean action contributions that are proportional to the area and
volume of a spherically symmetric profile. Like a bubble or a droplet separating the vapour and

liquid phases, a scalar field bubble separates the true vacuum from the false vacuum.

The thin-wall bubble, with surface area A and volume V, can be equally thought of as a closed
hypersurface embedded in flat Euclidean spacetime R* with a tension o, defined in Eq. on the

bubble membrane and an outward-pointing pressure, ¢, acting on the membrane,
Sp=oA-—ev. (31)

The question of finding the solution of lowest Euclidean action can now be answered using a

geometric interpretation, where performing variations of Eq. (31) gives the equation of a constant
iP)

mean curvature hypersurface K = £, where K is the mean curvature of the bubble profile. In the
thin-wall approximation, the bubble is a compact hypersurface of constant mean curvature - the

only example of which is a sphere, S°, for D = 4.

Here, Op = —0,0,+V" (dp) denotes the second-order fluctuation operator evaluated on the bounce
solution ¢», while O_ = —0,0, + V"(@_) is the corresponding operator around the false vacuum

solution ¢_. The symbol det refers to the determinant of the positive-definite part of the spectrum,
with the negative eigenvalue (_ and the zero modes separated explicitly. The existence of a negative
mode in the fluctuation spectrum is the signifier of the metastability of the false vacuum. The

prefactor V x (35) ° arises from integrating over the zero modes of the spectrum using the method
of collective coordinates, discussed in Ref. [49], where V represents the infinite spatial volume of
the Euclidean background. The Euclidean action, Sg, defined in Eq. also appears in the
exponential suppression factor - a result of a WKB approximation discussed in Refs. [2] [0]. A

comprehensive derivation of these factors is presented in Ref. [9].

An in-depth review of the thin-wall approximation applied to domain walls and instanton methods
is presented in the series by Mégevand & Membiela in Ref. with higher-order corrections

included in subsequent papers [51] [52].

C. Classical Bubble Nucleation

We now turn to the nucleation of classical bubbles in the presence of substrates. To address this, we
adapt techniques from classical nucleation theory, focusing on bubble formation on surfaces (com-
monly referred to as heterogeneous nucleation). We aim to investigate how density inhomogeneities

affect the rate of bubble formation.

For a thin membrane separating two phases (true and false vacua separated by our bubble wall)
to be stable, two conditions from hydrostatics must be satisfied simultaneously, found in Ref. [53].

These are:

well as the definition of the area Ag. hypersurface (yellow point).

FIG. 2: (a) shows the bubble and planar substrate system and the definition of the contact
hypersurface 0X as well as the substrate, S and the bubble hypersurface U. (b) shows how the
Dupré-Young condition determines the equilibrium junction condition in Eq. for the bubble

(blue) nucleating on the substrate (grey). The blue arrows represent the normal vector field to

the bubble surface, nj, and the red arrows represent the normal vector to the substrate, ng.

where R; are the principal radii of curvature and K is the mean curvature of the membrane
{54]. The bubble and substrate share a boundary UMS = OX which is a codimension-2
hypersurface that we shall call the contact hypersurface. In F 1G Pal the contact hypersurface

is represented by a yellow loop (in D = 3 this is referred to as the contact line).

e The Dupré-Young condition: imposes a junction condition between the surface tensions at

the contact hypersurface given by,

cones C= Ee Ae (34)

oO oO

B is the equilibrium contact angle defined as the internal angle between the tangent to the

bubble wall and the tangent to the substrate at the contact hypersurface shown in FIG.
14

In light of instanton calculations discussed earlier, the presence of the substrate modifies the Eu-

clidean action in Eq. (33), which follows from the discussions of Ref. [22],

Sp=oA-—eV +0,A,—0_As
(35)
=o0A-—eV —ocosBA,

where A, is the area on the substrate enclosed by the contact hypersurface, and we have used the

Dupré-Young condition to eliminate ox.

For a planar substrate, the area enclosed by the contact hypersurface, As, in Eq. can be
projected onto the bubble surface. We can calculate the areas using a single integration measure
f dA, where dA is the area differential on the bubble surface. We define d As as the scalar differential
area enclosed by the contact hypersurface. These area differentials are related to each other by
projecting the components of the vector area differential, dA, in the direction of the normal vector

to the substrate, ns,
dA, =n,- dA. (36)
In this way, we can calculate the area enclosed by the contact hypersurface on the bubble,
Ay= fi(ng-ne) dA (37)

ny is the unit vector field normal to the bubble, and the - represents the inner product between

two vectors. Therefore, our action in Eq. can be written more compactly,
Sp=-efaveo faa (1 — ng + np cos f). (38)

This representation of the action will prove useful when we consider the tree-level contributions to

the Euclidean action, especially in the case of a bubble forming on a planar substrate.

Ill. NON-TRIVIAL FIELD PROFILES AROUND DENSITY INHOMOGENEITIES

A. Vacuum Screening Inside Dense Spheres

We now consider some non-trivial solutions of the asymmetron field around a dense spherical

object, such as a star [12] [55]. In this section, we are primarily interested in obtaining scalar field
15

profiles as @ undergoes a density-driven phase transition. We will consider the radial step-function

density distribution,

ps forr <R,
(r) = (39)
0 forr > Rs

where ps > p?2M?. A spherically symmetric scalar field profile obeys the following quasi-static

(@ = 0) equation of motion,

dr? or dr d¢

2
O'S, Pe _ aati (40)

with ¢'(0) = 0 to keep ¢(r) regular at r = 0 and the asymptotic condition, ¢(00) = d+. We can
expand the potential to quadratic order both inside (r < R,) and outside (r > R,) the source,
ua ¢ for r < Rs

V() = 4 2M? (41)
zmild —os)? forr> Rs.

where d+ and mz are defined in Eq. (19) and Eq. (22) respectively. We further impose the

continuity of $(r) and ¢/(r) to ensure C!-smoothness on ¢(r).

In Ref. [12], the scalar field profile around a sphere with arbitrary radius Rs was found. However,

we are interested in calculating the energetic properties of the solution in the thin-shell limit,

Rs > Lz, such that the dynamics of the scalar field are concentrated at the surface of the sphere

r = Rg. In the fully-planar limit, we further perform a change of variables and follow Ref. [45] to

define z = r — Rs, in which case, Eq. is well-approximated by,

symmetry-breaking transition occurs, and as @ leaves the object, it very quickly rolls towards one

The screening mechanism weakly couples ¢ to the core of the sphere. Numerical plots of ¢(z) with

several values of R, are shown in FIG.

C. Unstable Spherical Domain Walls around Spherical Objects

Another non-trivial solution of Eq. (40), with the same boundary conditions, is a spherical domain
wall of radius R, engulfing a dense spherical object of radius Rs. When the domain wall is present,

there are additional energy contributions compared to the environment, which come from the
19

surface tension of the domain wall and the AV. The numerical profiles of the domain wall are
shown in FIG.|5| Though this solution is difficult to obtain analytically, we can discuss the energy
of such a configuration. The total energy of the configuration is given by,

radial scales; see e.g. Refs. [56}{59]. An important consideration in this analysis is the notion of
the critical bubble. This unstable configuration extremizes the bubble energy, balancing the inward

collapse due to the surface tension against the outward pressure difference across the wall. The

radius of the critical bubble is given by Ro = 2e

Evaluating the energy on the critical bubble, shown in Fig. |5| we find,

where Ao is defined in Eq. (51), and we have indicated the size of the leading and next-to-
leading terms, for simplicity assuming R, = O(R). The leading effect of the matter source is to
set to zero the contribution to the energy within the source. This decreases the magnitude of the
negative energy density contribution from the volume inside the critical bubble in Eq. (53), thereby
suppressing the decay rate for such a configuration. Note that the term containing Aco is the same
parametric size as terms dropped in Eq. (63), so to leading order there is no surface energy cost at

the boundary of the matter source.

IV. THE INSTANTONS

A. Coleman-Callan Instantons coupled to a homogeneous gas

In the thin-wall approximation, the instanton can geometrically be described as a codimension-1

hypersurface embedded in R? [2] 4] [60H62]. The thin-wall Euclidean action of the instanton offers
20

a low-energy effective description of the scalar dynamics,

Snld] ~ o fares - ef d?x/G. (55)

where © = Q2. is the bubble hypersurface. The first term is the Nambu-Goto action of the bubble
wall © and is proportional to the area of the hypersurface, and o is the surface tension of the
bubble in Eq. (30). The wall is furnished with coordinates €“. The second term is the volume
enclosed by the bubble multiplied by ¢ from Eq. across the wall. We will first address the
spherical bubbles of Ref. but now include corrections from the asymmetron mechanism in

the presence of a pressure-free gas of homogeneous matter density p.

To begin with, we write the metric of R? as a foliation of (D — 2)-spheres,
ds? = guydada” = dr? + dr? + r2dN?,_» (56)
where dQ? is the metric over a unit n-sphere. The induced metric yg on the bubble hypersurface,

&, is obtained by the pullback map of the background metric onto ©,

OX" OX”

Yab = Ee Bee Tey (57)

where X" = X¥(€%) is the function that embeds 5 into R?. The radial location of the bubble,

r = R(r), is treated as a free component of the induced metric, ds?, which is written as,
do? = Yopdétde? = ( + Re) dr? + R?(r)d3,_». (58)

We aim to solve for the function R(r). So, the action with the surface and volume terms is evaluated

as,

Sq = 2Vp_-1 [ " dr [RoR??V 1+ R2- Rr (59)
JO

where Rp = (Deis and Vp = Ses is the volume enclosed by a unit D-ball. Ro is the critical
radius of the bubble which balances the internal energy contribution and the surface energy such
that Sg is minimised for this radius as determined in Ref. [2]. This reformulates the instanton

calculation into a problem of one-dimensional Lagrangian mechanics, in which we solve for the

function, R(r). Since the action does not explicitly depend on 7, we have a conserved energy,

E=p,R-L=—R??

Ro A (60)

V1+R
21

where L is the Lagrangian of the action in Eq. (59). On rearranging Eq. we obtain the

instanton equation, which has the form,

where the potential function, U(R, E), is given by,

2U(R, E) =1- RD ERE DE:

We are interested in the E = 0 case since the instanton calculation assumes a zero input Euclidean

_ iid dR

Ro —2U(R)
where U(R) = U(R,0). The solution is a (D—1)-sphere with radius Ro with the equation given by,

The action is suppressed in denser regions and ultimately vanishes at p,, since the symmetry of

the potential in Eq. is restored and we only have one minimum at ¢ = 0 thus the scalar

cannot tunnel as there is no barrier to penetrate. The symmetron modification does not change in

other dimensions because the action always obeys the ratio,

D D 3

22

By following a similar argument, the critical radius, Ro = Be is unchanged under the modification.

Given a sufficiently large static ball of gas with density p in Euclidean spacetime, we can assume
that the translational invariance of the solutions is approximately preserved, and thus, we retain
the form of the decay rate per unit volume, we can compare the decay rate of this system by
dividing out by the decay rate of a similar system but at p = 0. The semiclassical contributions to

the ratio of decay rates are given by,

na x (1 PY eo f ( 2)']| (69)

where the proportionality symbol contains the non-zero modes of the fluctuation spectrum. Since

zero modes are translational symmetries of the instanton, they constitute a classical contribution

to the decay rate, so these contributions are explicitly shown in Eq. (69).

We now compute the decay rate per unit volume, ['/V, for a bubble forming in a subcritical gas
of density p. We use the BubbleDet package from Ref. to calculate the one-loop functional
determinant around the spherically-symmetric background field profile. We shall first define a
more simplified representation of [/V that BubbleDet can calculate directly. Firstly, we define the

logarithm of the determinant ratio,

(70)

S,= zm E =|

det O_
The determinant ratio is defined as the sum of one-loop vacuum Feynman diagrams, including
both connected and disconnected ones. The effective one-loop action contains zero modes, negative

modes, and positive modes. Thus, the decay rate for a general free bubble can be written as,

T (So+81)
p= eR (71)

where 59 = Bpuik is the semiclassical contribution to the bulk decay rate. The negative eigenvalue

£_ is also contained in the one-loop effective action, $1.

For the numerical calculation using BubbleDet, the ratio is given by,

T(p) ASo(p) + AS1(p)
T(0) exp 7 (72)

where we defined AS; = S;(~)—5;(0). In the thin-wall limit, the functional determinant expression

can be represented by the geometric properties of the bubble hypersurface as discussed in Ref. [60].

no ~ O(1) and a calculated value of Bp = 547.55h. For an increasing density, no increases

rapidly. As the density is increased beyond p ~ 0.1p:?2M?, the gradient of the ratio begins to
decrease, until a maximum ratio is reached which occurs at a peak density, Ppeak © 0.98).-
Increasing the density beyond ppeak results in a sharp drop-off, suppressing the rate of vacuum

bubble production.

In FIG. {6 we show a plot of the ratio of the decay rate as a function of p. The BubbleDet package
in Ref. [63] was used to calculate the ratio of the decay rates since it does not trivially cancel. The
functional determinant expression in BubbleDet calculates the sum of all one-loop contributions

to the quantum effective action.

To understand the initial enhancement in the decay rate with density, note that the width of the
potential barrier A¢ and the height of the barrier AVinax = |Ver(¢_)| both decrease as the density
increases. Each of these effects increases the nucleation rate. The sharp decrease as the density
approaches p, is due to the zero mode contribution, (1 - ae dominating over the exponential
term. Within the validity of the instanton approximation, this pushes the peak density, Ppeak,

ever-closer to px.
24

FIG. 7: In R?, bubbles (blue) interact with cylindrical substrates (grey): (left) one fully
engulfing the substrate, and (right) one forming at its edge. The time-evolution of the static

substrate traces out a cylinder, R x S?~?.

Given that the instanton approximation is only valid when Bpux >> h, we note that the decay
rate is exponentially enhanced for homogeneous densities in the range 0 < p S p,(1— e~Bouk/@M)),
with the upper bound very close to the critical density. The rate is then suppressed for even
higher densities, falling rapidly to zero as p + px from below. The peak enhancement occurs at
Ppeak & (1—(2h/, Bo)?/) px, at which point the rate is no longer exponentially suppressed. While the
validity of the instanton approximation is compromised at this density, implying that the precise
value of P(Ppeak) cannot be trusted, the approximation is nevertheless valid either side of this value,
and it predicts that the transition proceeds rapidly for Ppeak — p < O((Bo/h)~?/*), i.e. for densities
slightly below the critical density.

V. NUCLEATION OF BUBBLES ON CURVED SURFACES

A. Bubble Nucleation on Substrates

In the previous analysis, we demonstrated that for p < px, the decay rate '(p), for a bubble forming
in a gas with density p, increases with increasing density p, for larger densities. However, I'(p)
is maximised for a density Ppeak, such that Ppeak — Pp» < px. When p > p,, tunnelling can no
longer occur, because the barrier of Veg(¢) vanishes. However, another interesting question arises:

Can asymmetron bubbles nucleate on the boundary between super- and subcritically dense media?
25

There are several ways in which the bubble can form on such a substrate, as discussed in Ref. [22].

We are interested in the following three,
(i) Planar Substrate Case - when the bubble forms on the edge of a flat matter source,

(ii) Engulfing Cylindrical Case (interstitial in Ref. [22]) - when the bubble wraps around a

spacetime cylindrical substrate,

(iii) Edge Cylindrical Cases - when the bubble forms on the edge of a spacetime cylindrical

substrate.

For instanton calculations, we are interested in substrates that are flat in the imaginary time
direction; otherwise, this would have the interpretation of a dynamical surface. We have not yet
considered the effects or the interpretation of the Wick rotation of a surface that is curved in the
imaginary time direction. We also note a point of possible confusion: static spherical objects trace
out a cylindrical hypersurface in the imaginary time direction - S = R x S?-?. So we will refer

to such a substrate as cylindrical, even though the object itself is a sphere, S?~?

, in space. For a
planar substrate R?-?, the imaginary time evolution is given by S = R x R?-? = R?-!. Thus,

the substrate is the evolution of the static object through imaginary time.

We further split the edge case into two subcategories: convex edge, when the bubble forms on the
exterior of the cylindrical substrate; and the concave edge, when the bubble forms on the interior of
a cylindrical substrate. FIG. [2a] shows a diagram of a bubble nucleating on a flat planar substrate.
FIG. [7|shows diagrams of a bubble nucleating in the engulfing (left-hand figure) and convex (right-
hand figure) edge cases. In all cases, we will refer to the curvature radius of the substrate as Rg.
In what follows, we assume that the substrate has density p > p, and is embedded in a matter
vacuum, so that bubble nucleation can occur only at or beyond the substrate boundary. Using the
modified asymmetron parameters, we will demonstrate how the presence of matter with p < px

alters the relevant bubble properties as in Eq. (67).

1. Bubbles on Planar Substrates

We begin with a most straightforward case of a bubble forming on a planar substrate. The z-axis
is the spatial direction normal to the plane, which is located at z = 0 and ns points in the z > 0

direction. The substrate lies parallel to the mutually-orthogonal axes of imaginary time, 7, and the
26

remaining D — 2 spatial directions. Thus, the plane is a codimension-1 hypersurface. The normal
vector to the bubble must meet the normal of the flat substrate at the contact angle 6, at the
contact hypersurface, thus we assume that the system has a symmetry, SO(D — 1), for rotations

about the z-axis. We choose a background metric with this symmetry in mind,

ds* = dz? + dr? + r°dO}_» (73)
where r is the radial displacement from the origin r defined by, r2 = 7? + wey x. The function

describing the bubble is r = R(z) so the induced metric is,
dc? = yapdéde? = (1+ R?) dz? + R?(z)dNG_». (74)

The normal vectors on the substrate and the bubble are

1 dr — R'dz
Ns = dz, ny
1+ R?
Ww (75)
Ny Ns = Vr
Thus, we construct the Euclidean action,
zm
Sig = eV / dz RP? [Rov +R? + RoR! cos B — R| (76)
0

which is structurally similar to the integrand in Eq. (59). Since the Lagrangian does not depend

explicitly on z, we can derive a conserved quantity once more given by

R
_ D-2 0
I=-R a H Rl 0. (77)

II and is called the spatial momentum density and is identical in structure to the expression for E

in Eq. (60), and the analysis of the previous calculation follows. Again, we set II = 0 and find that
the bubble profile is described by a spherical cap. We use the Dupré-Young condition to obtain a
natural boundary condition for the bubble at the substrate, given by R’(0) = tan (3 = 8), (where

" denotes a derivative with respect to z), so we find the spherical cap is parametrised by 8,
R(z) = 4/ RR (z+ RocosB)? for z >0 (78)

which is the equation of a spherical cap with the correct equilibrium contact angle on the substrate.

The integration limit in Eq. is given by,
Zm = Ro(1— cos B). (79)

B is obtained by substituting the instanton equation and changing to an angular variable, R =

+R sin(u),

2¢

8B
By(B) = eVp-1 RY i sin?~(u) [eos?(uw) — cos(8) cos(u)] du. (80)

The integral here deviates from Eq. (65), with the additional boundary substrate term this
additional term subtracts the volume inside the substrate from the volume enclosed by the spherical
bubble to give the volume of the spherical cap. For example, in the D = 4 case, the action is given

by
B,(8) = 7 [3 — sin eos 3 — £ sin’ Bcos 8 (81)

as found in Ref. [22] with Bo defined in Eq. (66). Since 8 ~ 5, the bubble is approximately a
hemisphere with action, B,($,0) ~ 4 Bo. When the density outside the substrate is 0 < p < px,
we can promote o and ¢ to their symmetron counterparts to obtain the density dependence of the

planar substrate-bubble system,

B,(8,p) = Ay B —sin B cos 8 — jain! soos] (: -_ 2) ° (82)
T 3 Px

The symmetron modification has the same effect in this case as the bubble nucleating in the bulk

of the scalar field.

The decay rate for bubble nucleation on such a substrate in D = 4, is given by,

a (2)’ 1 ( TEL=O,0 + Ven(o0))) * Be (83)
A \2nh) Vie] \ det[-.8, V6] )

Since the plane breaks translational invariance of the bounce in the z direction, we lose one zero

mode in the spectrum, and thus, the method of collective coordinates [9] [10] [49] results in a factor
of the area, A, instead of the conventional volume factor, V. Essentially, a particular bubble with
some radius can form anywhere on the plane with a contact angle 8, but cannot form arbitrarily

can be compared to the decay rate initially described Eq. (69). The negative eigenvalue is denoted

by @.

2. Engulfing Instanton

For cylindrical substrates, we will first consider the case of the engulfing instanton. In this case, a

spacelike slice of the diagram in FIG. [7] through the bubble results in a pair of concentric (D— 1)-
28

spheres, the smaller one representing the substrate and the larger one the bubble wall. The time

evolution of the bubble is given by a function r = R(r), and the background metric is the same as

Eq. (56).

The background metric, ds”, and induced metric, ds?, are given by,

ds* = dr? + dr? + r°d},_»

, (84)
de? = (1+ BR?) dr? + R°(r)d%_y.
Thus, the action for this system is given by,
Ts -
Sp =2Vp-4 | dr [Re (Rov 1+ Re R) — RP-? (Ro cos 8 — Rs)| (85
0
The conserved energy F is given by,
R RP-2
E on + RP-1 = — Ry RP cos B + RP, (86
V1+R?
Finally, we change variables using the instanton equation to obtain,
Rx
Beng = 2€Vp-1 | dRR?~?,/R2 —(R- ERP), (87
where R,, is the largest positive root of the equation,
RP-14 RoR??? -E=0. (88

and R, depends on R, through Eq. (88). The solution to the Euclidean action Beng is numerically
calculated for several angles for spheres of various radii, Rs and presented in FIG.|8} For 6 > 5, we
see that for R, < Ro, then the Euclidean action is close to that of the bulk bubble. As the seed is
made bigger, a larger critical bubble must be nucleated, which has a greater Euclidean action cost,
making the bubble less likely to engulf a large seed. This motivates edge nucleation in Ref. [22].

For angles 6 < 5, the small R, behaviour is much the same. However, when R, ~ Ro, the
Euclidean action acquires a local minimum, for which the rate of bubble nucleation is enhanced.
For Rs > Ro, the Euclidean action again increases as a larger bubble must be formed, which again

suppresses the rate of bubble nucleation on larger seeds.

While 6 > 5 exhibits interesting behaviour for R, ~ Ro, the only physically relevant range of

angles for the nucleation of asymmetron bubbles satisfies the inequality, 6 2 5. Thus, for the

angles we are interested in, the Euclidean action is always greater than Bo.

3. Edge Instantons: Perturbative Expansion

To extend the analysis to nucleation of bubbles on a cylindrical substrate, we can perturbatively
calculate corrections to the Euclidean action from the planar case introduced in Ref. [53]. Thus,

the Euclidean action can be split into the planar contribution and an R,-dependent perturbation

part,
Beage = Bp + AB (89)

where AB is the O(R;") correction to the Euclidean action. For simplicity, we consider the bubble
forming on the edge of a cylindrical substrate. The correction to the Euclidean action in Eq.
on a convex (taking the + sign) or concave (taking the — sign) cylindrical surface is given by,

A

The term with the + sign was determined in Ref. [22]. The — sign is explained by following the

conventions in Ref. [53], or rather more simply using the calculation presented in Ref. [22], and

(90)

switching the sign in terms containing Rs. It can be seen that the smallest Euclidean action is

achieved by a bubble forming on a concave substrate (such as the interior of a spherical cavity or

substrate actions are plotted in FIG. [9] for 6 = 5 along with the actions for the corresponding
planar and engulfing bubbles. The edge cases diverge for R; < Ro as the perturbative calculation

breaks down.

VI. DISCUSSION

A. What is the preferred nucleation channel?

Consider an approximately spherical vacuum chamber with radius Rs and the density inside the
sphere p = 0. The instanton equations are solved by the slightly concave solution or the spherical
bulk instanton with p = 0 in Eq. (59). We can compare the decay rates to determine whether there
is a preference for a particular bubble at some radius of curvature. We know that the concave edge
case has the smallest Euclidean action, making it the preferred decay channel semiclassically. We

are interested in whether quantum corrections can present a maximum curvature radius for which
31

edge nucleation is preferred. The decay rates for the edge and bulk cases are given by,

The zero modes make this expression formally divergent; thus, one employs the method of inte-

det [Opbutr,—] removed 2rh det [Oputk,—

where det is the fluctuation determinant with the zero modes removed. This means that the
functional determinant ratio on the right-hand side has an overall dimensionality of [length]~4.
Similarly, for the edge case, the method of collective coordinate would result in the following

expression,

In this case, the functional determinant on the right-hand side has an overall dimensionality of

flength]~*.
32

Assuming both fluctuation operators only contain one negative mode each, this means that there
is one additional positive fluctuation mode in the edge case operator compared to the bulk case,
which we need to isolate from the fluctuation spectrum to explicitly show the correct dimensions
in the formula for the ratio. This gives the following expression for the ratio K,

K oc 20 y -AB/n (96)

Rs

We wish to condense all of the length dependence into the exponential part of the expression without
introducing further length scales into the problem. Irrespective of the nuance of evaluating the
functional determinants and negative eigenvalues in the thin-wall approximation, the only length
scale available to the instanton will be Ro; thus, at least heuristically, the negative modes of both
the bulk and edge cases are x Ro 2 This is explicitly shown for the bulk instanton in Ref. [9]. The
ratio of the negative modes does not contribute any new length scale to the formula. Computing
the one-loop functional determinant as done in Ref. [63], the standard result is that the tree-level
contributions are scaled by the exponential of a dimensionless number, e*, where K is an O(1)
number. When combined with the semiclassical exponent, K is much smaller by several orders of
magnitude than the Euclidean action; thus, we shall ignore it in the subsequent analysis. Thus,

we obtain the effective action difference, Jor,

where AB is defined as,

AB = Byux {1 — f(S) 4 Ro) ind B (98)

where f(3) = 4 [8 — sin B cos 8 — 3 sin? 8 cos 8]. The exponent is then given by,

e If Z.¢ > 0 then the edge case is the dominant decay process,

e but, if Sea < 0, then the bulk case is the dominant decay process.

But the equation for Z.g¢ = 0 is transcendental, so an explicit expression that can be numerically
solved using the Newton-Raphson scheme as shown in FIG. In any case, we can obtain a

leading-order closed-form expression within the regime of our approximations,

ie = ews 1-1(8)) x exp re (7) sin? 6| ‘ (100)

33

The convergence of the Newton-Raphson scheme is shown in FIG. using a representative value

of Bo = 100h, p = 0 and 6 = § so that f(8) = 3. We solve the equation,

Du 4B; il
h(x) =a — eB exp bik (=)| =0. (101)
5th \ax
where x = ze. The iterated values of the Newton-Raphson scheme are calculated by the formula,
h(2n)
Ha = fn — ; 102
Tn+1 Ln Wi (&n) , ( )

where we have used 9 = 100, we define convergence by a tolerance such that when 62 = an41—2n =

10-1°, the iterative scheme is terminated.

On the contrary, the scale hierarchy of the thin-wall and perturbative approximations used to obtain
the action of the instanton forming on a concave substrate: Lp < Ro < Rs. The first inequality is
the regime of the thin-wall approximation, and the second inequality gives the perturbative regime
for the approximately planar substrate. We can then expand the expression in terms of powers of

(#) such that the leading-order contribution to Rs/Ro is given by,

Aw Roe [1-F(8)] (103)

where A is the critical radius of curvature of the chamber for which Zg ~ 0. In the case of a
hemispherical bubble 6 = 5, this critical radius for a substrate surrounded by a matter vacuum is

approximately,
Bo
Ax Roe. (104)

Thus, if Rs < A, then the decay of the false vacuum on the edge is dominant, whereas for Rs > A,
the bulk decay is dominant. Using the representative value presented in FIG. we see that the

result of this approximation gives an estimate for the order of magnitude of the ratio A/Ro, since

A 50 21

Ro (105)
The instanton calculation is valid when Bo >> h and thus, the proportionality constant between A

and Ro is a large number, so this critical radius A lies in the region of validity of the perturbative

spherical edge calculations performed earlier.

B. Estimating A in Vacuum Chamber Experiments

Using the estimated values of the parameters of the symmetron suggested in Ref. [33], we can

provide an estimate of this upper limit of edge nucleation in a vacuum chamber with radius R,.

Newton-Raphson method with a representative values of By = 100h, p = 0 and 8 = § so that

FIG. 10: A graph showing the convergence of the solution of A to Eq.

f(8) = 3. We use a tolerance of 62 = 1071, and we observe convergence after only 8 iterations of
the Newton-Raphson scheme. It can be seen that even for small values of Bo within the instanton
approximation, this critical radius converges on an enormous factor of Ro, A ~ 10??Ro, which

matches the order-of-magnitude estimate in Eq. (105).
Then we can apply the symmetron modification to Eq. (104) and obtain,

a
'g 8
A = Roexp B (1 - *) / (106)

Bo is given by Eq. and we use a representation of Ro that is directly expressed in term of the

asymmetron parameters (j, /, A, «),

(107)

and we take « ~ 0.01). In Ref. [33], Clements et. al suggest a spherical chamber with internal radius
Rs = 10cm (which they call L) and use their symmetron parameter values, pp = 2 x 107!8 GeV,

M

100GeV and A = 107!°. With this equivalent choice of parameters, we find our critical
35

instanton bubble to have a radius,

_{_3v2 1
Ro = (rn) x (100) GeV

1
=2~x 105 Gev-! (108)

= 40 cm.

Ro is of the same order of magnitude as the suggested chamber radius Rs = 10 cm in Ref. [33];
therefore, bubble nucleation is a physically relevant phenomenon that would be observable at the

scale of these vacuum chamber experiments.

To determine the value of the exponent, we use the value of Ro determined in Eq. (108),

Bo _ mW Rée
Hh ~—s«d12
2 4
_ m(uRo)" (£)
2 soot (109)
__7™ * (400)" ool

(18) x (10-10)
=4~x 108

thus, the critical radius of curvature, A ~ 40 x 101-74x10"* or, Thus, in the vacuum chamber in
Ref. [33], we expect the nucleation rate to be dominated by bubbles forming on the edge of the
vacuum chamber as opposed to the bulk of the scalar field. However, this is the leading order
correction to A, which means we are ignoring explicit curvature corrections to the size of the
vacuum chamber. In principle, neither the edge planar nor the bulk vacuum bubble would form on

a time scale comparable to the age of the Universe since their Euclidean actions are of the same

order of magnitude. Setting « = KA, we can express A = 52 exp (Bx). This means that A
decreases as A is made larger in magnitude. Similarly, as we make y larger, A decreases.

For a chamber filled with a subcritical gas with density p, the critical radius of curvature receives
a density-dependent correction as shown in Eq. (Los). When ps — p < px, we see that the critical
radius of curvature at leading order is of the same order as the critical bubble radius, A 2 Ro.
Ref. suggests that to observe the symmetry-breaking transition that leads to the formation of
domain walls, the vacuum chamber must be filled with a gas to restore the Zz symmetry of the
potential. Then the gas should be released from the chamber. As the density in the chamber falls

below p,, the scalar field forms domains of the false and true vacuum. Patches within the chamber
36

that settle in ¢_ will immediately begin to proliferate bubbles in the bulk phase; however, as the

density is decreased further, the bubbles preferentially form on the chamber walls.

C. Applications to Cosmic Voids

The critical radius of curvature, A, of a hollow spherical void can be calculated for the symmetron
at the cosmological scale. As the symmetron is proposed to be a candidate for dark matter and
dynamical dark energy in Ref. [12], such a calculation is worth considering for the asymmetron. An
example of cosmological symmetron parameters (j, //, A) are presented in Ref. [7]. We shall again

take « = 0.01, as a representative example. A cosmic void is a large-scale structure analogous to

a vacuum chamber. They are defined to be a region of space in which the density of matter is
~ 10% that of the average density of the Universe. We ignore the self-gravitation of the domain

walls and the expansion of the Universe for the sake of simplicity.

Using the equations in Ref. [17] and in Appendix [A] the exemplar cosmological symmetron param-

eters are given by,
pe 0.5 (Mpc)7!
M ~ 5.72 x 10° GeV (110)
d ~ 6.312 x 10714,

Using Eq. (107), we can calculate the radius of the critical bubble,
Ro ~ 85 Mpc. (111)

We determine that j1Ro ~ 42.5, which enters into the Euclidean action,

x (42.5)* x 0.01 (112)

and so we find that at the cosmological scale, a cosmic void with radius greater than the critical
radius of curvature, A, given by,
107
A = 85e2834x10" Mine

(113)
~ 85 x 1013x108" Mie
37

is the upper limit to edge bubble nucleation. Thus, it is safe to say that at the cosmological
scale for a spherically symmetric cosmological void, the edge instanton is always preferred. This is
significant for the assumptions of cosmological simulations like those of Ref. [I7] where the authors
randomly seed asymmetron domains in a region and perform N-body simulations. Our calculation
shows that at least for instantons, the cosmological asymmetron shows a preference for forming

true vacuum bubbles at the edge of a cosmological void.

We saw previously that the semiclassical decay rate and thus the probability of bubble nucleation
are maximised for a peak matter density that is very close to the px. The cosmological symmetron
parameters in Appendix [A] allow us to determine the critical density of the symmetron potential

to be,
px ~ 3.4 x 10-8 g/cm? (114)

To determine the density of a galactic void, we would like to calculate the average matter density

of the Universe. The critical density, perit, is given by,
3H5 30 3
Perit = —— ~ 8 x 10°" g/cm (115)
81G
and the average matter density, p» is given by,

Pm = ImPerit = 0-315 X Perit X 2.7 x 107°° g/cm, (116)

Finally, a cosmic void has a matter density, pyoia ~ 0-lpm, which gives,

Proid & 2.7 X 1073! g/cm’. (117)

which is again quite disconcerting for the bulk bubble nucleation within a cosmic void with density
corrections since 1 — pm/ps 1. Within a cosmic void, the density corrections cannot sufficiently
reduce A to allow bulk nucleation. However, in more dense environments that are still subcritical,

we expect the decay rate to be much larger.

VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this work, we have shown that the coupling of the asymmetron to environmental density distri-
butions allows bubbles to nucleate in more elaborate ways than the bulk nucleation mechanism of

Ref. 2]. We first demonstrated that dense objects immersed in a false vacuum background acquire
38

a surface energy density o, due to the screening mechanism of the asymmetron. For sufficiently
large and dense objects, the planar limit yields a surface energy density that is determined solely
by the properties of the vacuum potential, such as the external VEV and mass of the asymmetron.
Using the Nambu-Goto action, we calculated the decay rate of the false vacuum in the presence
of a homogeneous gas of subcritical density. The enhanced nucleation rate in such environments
arises because the barrier in the effective potential is both lower and narrower in regions of higher
density. As the system undergoes density-driven symmetry breaking, there is a rapid proliferation
of bubbles, which diminishes as the gas continues to diffuse and the density decreases. The Nambu-
Goto action was then extended to include nucleation on substrates of supercritical density. Such
substrates carry a surface tension and introduce boundary terms into the effective Nambu-Goto
action. For the planar substrate, we found that bubbles nucleate as spherical caps, and we paid
special attention to the hemispherical bubbles, which contribute half the Euclidean action of a
bulk bubble. Thus, boundary nucleation is preferred semiclassically. For cylindrical substrates,
our results reproduce the earlier semiclassical analyses in Ref [22] for convex geometries, and we
extended these calculations to concave cylinders. We find that concave cylindrical substrates give
the smallest Euclidean action, implying the strongest enhancement of nucleation rates. This is
especially relevant for laboratory searches for fifth forces of Ref. [33], where the walls of a vacuum
chamber may be modelled as concave cylindrical substrates and possible bubble formation in cos-
mic voids. Our results suggest that bubble nucleation is amplified in regions of high curvature,

with additional enhancement from the presence of a surrounding subcritical gas.

While our analysis provides a consistent framework for nucleation catalysed by density distributions
and substrates, we have limited ourselves to the hierarchy of scales Li < Ro and, in places, also
to Rs < Ro. Firstly, our perturbative inclusion of curvature effects in Section [V A3] breaks down
when the bubble radius and curvature radius of the substrate become comparable. This could be
overcome by solving the Nambu-Goto equations for the worldsheet instantons numerically, perhaps
extending methods developed for worldline instantons [64]. Secondly, the Nambu-Goto formalism
itself breaks down when the bubble wall thickness becomes comparable to its radius. While the
effects of the bubble wall width can be carried out perturbatively [50}52], eventually they must be
included to all orders by solving the instanton field equations directly. Another limitation is the
assumption of zero temperature. At low temperatures, the spherical bounces we have considered
simply become periodic in imaginary time with frequency proportional to the inverse temperature,

- but in the high-temperature regime (T’ >> j2), the system undergoes dimensional reduction, with
39

the 5° bounce replaces by a cylindrical configuration R x S?, [22] [60]. A systematic analysis of

thermal nucleation rates in the asymmetron model remains an important extension.

Finally, because the asymmetron is a scalar-tensor theory, gravitational effects are essential for a
complete description. In particular, we expect that regions near the critical density (where nucle-
ation is most prolific) could lead to collisions and coalescence of bubbles, producing gravitational
wave signatures. Such processes may contribute to the stochastic gravitational wave background,

offering a potential observational window into the dynamics we have described.

where (x is the strength of the asymmetron fifth force relative to the Newtonian gravitational force
on either of the scalar domains $+, & is the Compton wavelength in units of the Hubble length,
and a, is the scale factor at symmetry breaking. Ref. [17] neglects the factors of M, in Eqs. (A2}
[A3). Since our instanton calculations are within the thin-wall limit, it is more appropriate for us
to take the symmetron convention where 6, = 6, = G_. A representative choice of the symmetron
parameters from Ref. [I7] is given by (&, a4, 8.) = (3.3 1074, 0.33, 1) which we can use to calculate
the critical radius of curvature of a large spherical and hollow cosmological structure such as an

intergalactic void.
