Motivated by the pseudo-entropy program, we investigate timelike subregion complexity within
the holographic “Complexity=Volume” framework, extending the usual spatial constructions to
Lorentzian boundary intervals. For hyperbolic timelike regions in AdS geometries, we compute the
corresponding bulk volumes and demonstrate that, despite the Lorentzian embedding, the resulting
subregion complexity remains purely real. We further generalize our analysis to AdS black brane
geometries, where the extremal surfaces can either be constant-time hypersurfaces or penetrate the
horizon. In all cases, the computed complexity exhibits the same universal UV divergences as in the
spacelike case but shows no imaginary contribution, underscoring its causal and geometric origin.
This stands in sharp contrast with the complex-valued pseudo-entropy and suggests that holographic
complexity preserves a genuinely geometric and real character even under Lorentzian continuation.

I. INTRODUCTION

Quantum entanglement has long been recognized as a
undamental probe of quantum correlations and space-
time structure in holographic theories [I}{3]. Tradition-
ally, entanglement entropy is defined for spatial subre-
gions at a fixed time slice, capturing the pattern of quan-
tum correlations among spatially separated degrees of
freedom in the boundary theory. However, recent de-
velopments have extended this concept beyond equal-
ime slices, leading to a novel quantity known as pseudo-
entropy [46]. This extension enables the study of
entanglement-like measures for timelike subregions and
or transitions between quantum states.

Pseudo-entropy generalizes entanglement entropy to
the case of nontrivial quantum state transitions. Given
an initial and a final state, |,);) and |r), one defines a
transition matrix

and the pseudo-entropy of a subsystem A (of a bipartite
system AU B) as

Ta = Trpt. (2)
Unlike conventional entanglement entropy, pseudo-
entropy can acquire complex values due to the non-
Hermitian nature of 7. Its real part quantifies a gener-
alized correlation between |y;) and |wW), while its imagi-
nary part encodes a phase-like structure associated with
emporal or causal transitions. The appearance of such
complex contributions points toward a richer analytic
structure underlying holographic information measures.
In the context of AdS/CFT correspondence [7],
seudo-entropy naturally motivates the study of timelike

extremal surfaces anchored on timelike boundary inter-
vals [8] [9]. These surfaces extend the Ryu-Takayanagi
(RT) construction [I] [2] into Lorentzian regions of AdS,
where the induced metric on the extremal surface may
change signature. Such generalizations have attracted
increasing interest in recent years (see e.g. [IOHI6}).
The corresponding holographic entanglement entropy for
timelike subregions generally acquires an imaginary part,
which is interpreted as the bulk dual of the complex-
valued pseudo-entropy. This complexification hints that
other quantum information measures, such as quantum
complexity, might also admit timelike or complexified ex-
tensions.

Holographic quantum complexity provides a geomet-
ric measure of how difficult it is to prepare a particular
boundary state from a simple reference state using a min-
imal set of quantum operations. The two best-known
proposals are the “Complexity=Volume” (CV) conjec-
ture [17] [[8]—further extended to subregion complexity
in [19] (see also [20) [21] )—and the “Complexity=Action”
(CA) conjecture [22] [23], whose subregion version has
been explored in [24}26]. These frameworks have deep-
ened our understanding of information storage and state
preparation in holographic field theories, particularly for
spatially defined subsystems and global states.

Despite this progress, the generalization of holographic
complexity to timelike subregions has remained largely
unexplored. Motivated by the pseudo-entropy frame-
work, we introduce and analyze a timelike version of sub-
region complexity within the CV proposal. This involves
evaluating the bulk volume enclosed by timelike extremal
surfaces—extending the original construction of [19] into
Lorentzian regions of AdS. Conceptually, this provides a
natural holographic dual for a measure of “temporal cir-
cuit depth” or the complexity associated with time evo-
lution between quantum configurations in the boundary
theory.

In this work, we focus first on timelike hyperbolic
subregions in AdSg+2, building on the explicit extremal
surfaces found in [8] [9]. We compute the correspond-
ing bulk volumes and analyze their divergence struc-
tures. Remarkably, we find that—unlike the case of
pseudo-entropy—timelike subregion complexity remains
purely real. This indicates that holographic complex-
ity retains a purely geometric interpretation, even in
the presence of Lorentzian embeddings, and may there-
fore probe aspects of spacetime geometry inaccessible to
entanglement-based measures.

We then extend our analysis to thermal states de-

scribed by AdS black brane geometries, where the pres-
ence of horizons renders the extremal surfaces more in-
ricate. We show that, depending on the causal nature
of the subregion, the extremal surfaces can penetrate the
horizon, and the resulting complexity exhibits both uni-
versal UV divergences and finite, horizon-dependent cor-
rections.
The remainder of this letter is organized as follows. In
Sec. II, we compute the timelike subregion complexity
‘or hyperbolic regions in pure AdS. In Sec. II, we gen-
eralize the construction to AdS black hole backgrounds
and analyze the resulting behavior near and beyond the
horizon. Sec. IV is devoted to concluding remarks and
ossible extensions.

Il. TIMELIKE SUBREGION AND
HOLOGRAPHIC VOLUME

Following [8} [9], we consider a timelike boundary sub-
region embedded in an AdSa12 spacetime with d > 1.
The bulk geometry is described by the metric

R?

ds”
re

(ar? + dy? — dé? + dX}_1), (3)

where y is a fixed spectator coordinate, Xqg_; denotes the
(d — 1)-dimensional transverse space, and R is the AdS
radius. The boundary subsystem is chosen as a timelike
hyperbolic region €? < ad with T the boundary time
interval. The corresponding area functional takes the
form

A= Hyak! [dr avin vin 6" (4)

Tr

where Hy_; = Vol(Xq_1) is the transverse volume. Ex-
tremizing this functional yields two branches of extremal

surfaces [8} [9]

pCO)

corresponding to spacelike and timelike surfaces, respec-
tively. The timelike branch exists only for r > z, defining
a causal cutoff in the bulk geometry.

These two branches together constitute the full ex-
tremal surface configuration that defines the timelike

subregion problem. As demonstrated in [8] [9], while the
area of the spacelike branch remains real, the timelike
branch introduces an imaginary contribution to the en-
tanglement entropy. This motivates studying its analog
in holographic complexity, where one expects both real
and potentially complex geometric contributions.

In the subregion complexity CV prescription [19], holo-
graphic complexity is proportional to the bulk volume
enclosed by the extremal surfaces:

ga
dr dé pati? (6)

V = Hy Rt [
JE<f(r)

where f(r) is the extremal profile defined in Eq. @. In
this case, the relevant volume is the region enclosed be-
tween the two branches, as illustrated in Figure [I] Per-
forming the € integration then yields the volume differ-
ence between the branches, given by

y d pati pati

2Hy Rt! fe (24 2)3 _ [ra (2-8
(7)

where € is a UV cutoff near the boundary r = 0. The sec-
ond integral starts at r = T/2 since the timelike branch
exists only for r > T'/2. The factor of 2 arises from the
symmetry of the volume under consideration.

and timelike (red) extremal surfaces represents the bulk vol-
ume associated with the timelike subregion complexity.

Following [19], the timelike subregion complexity is de-
fined as

Cr= GR’ (8)

where G is the (d + 1)-dimensional Newton constant. It
is clear from Eq. that both integrals individually ex-
hibit IR divergences at r — oo, but these cancel in the
difference, leaving a finite volume. The UV divergences
at r — 0 are regularized by e.

Although Eq. can be expressed in terms of hyper-
geometric functions for general d, it is more instructive to
present explicit results for lower dimensions. Evaluating

the integrals for d = 1,2,3,4 gives

The divergence structure mirrors that of the spacelike
CV proposal: power-law UV divergences corresponding
to short-distance correlations, and universal logarithmic

terms appearing in even dimensions. The leading di-
vergence scales with the volume of the boundary subre-
gion, confirming that the dominant contribution to holo-
graphic complexity arises from the near-boundary geom-
etry.
An important distinction emerges when comparing
with the entanglement entropy of timelike regions: the
complexity expressions in Eq. are purely real. While
the timelike branch of the extremal surface leads to an
imaginary contribution in entanglement entropy due to
the analytic continuation across the light cone, in the
complexity—volume relation the integration is performed
over a strictly Lorentzian region with r > T/2, yielding
a real-valued geometric volume.
To gain a better intuition for the quantity we are com-
uting, let us focus on the three-dimensional case. The
corresponding extremal surfaces in Poincaré and global
coordinates are depicted in Fig. [2] (see also [8}). In the
context of entanglement entropy, when one transitions
o global coordinates, the timelike branch becomes ap-
arent, giving rise to the imaginary contribution in the
seudo-entropy. For complexity, if one ignores the time-
ike surface, the relevant bulk volume would appear to be
hat enclosed by the spacelike RT curve and the Poincaré
horizon in the global coordinate patch. However, once
he timelike extremal surface is included, the proper vol-
ume is the region enclosed between the spacelike and
imelike branches—illustrated by the shaded region in
Fig. 2]
One might naturally wonder whether this configura-
ion implies a hidden causal connection between the two
branches, absent in the usual spacelike case, which could
in principle lead to an imaginary contribution to the com-
plexity. At present, however, it remains unclear whether
such a causal volume genuinely exists []
From a technical perspective, for odd d both limits o
he timelike integral acquire phase factors that cancel,
leaving a purely real result. Hence, timelike complex-
ity measures only the accessible Lorentzian bulk volume,

Figure 2. Extremal surfaces for a timelike entangling region
(blue interval) in Poincaré (left) and global (right) coordi-
nates. In the global case, in addition to the spacelike ex-
tremal surface (green), there exists a timelike one (red). The
timelike subregion complexity corresponds to the bulk volume
enclosed between these two surfaces, illustrated by the shaded
(colored) region. This figure essentially reproduces Fig. 3 of
[8] for clarity and comparison. Here, (r,z) and (7,p) denote
the Poincaré and global coordinate systems, respectively.

while pseudo-entropy captures phase information related
to temporal correlations.

Comparing our results with those for spacelike subre-
gions obtained in [19], we find that although the over-
all divergence structure of timelike subregion complexity
closely parallels the spacelike case, the two are not re-
lated by a simple Wick rotation. Both share the same
hierarchy of UV divergences—power-law terms reflect-
ing short-distance correlations and logarithmic terms in
even dimensions—but their finite parts differ in both
magnitude and interpretation. In particular, for odd-
dimensional AdS backgrounds, timelike complexity lacks
the universal constant term that characterizes its space-
like counterpart. This absence suggests that timelike
complexity has a fundamentally distinct geometric origin,
one not obtainable by analytic continuation of the spa-
tial result. Rather, it arises directly from the Lorentzian
causal structure of the extremal hypersurface.

To further clarify this point, consider repeating the
extremization procedure for a spacelike subregion pos-
sessing spherical symmetry at the boundary. The cor-
responding area functional admits two distinct extremal
solutions:

e(r)=V@-P, &(r)=iV@ 47, (13)

where ¢ is the radius of the boundary entangling region.

The first branch corresponds to the well-known RT sur-
face [I], which provides the minimal-area prescription for
holographic entanglement entropy and forms the basis for
computing holographic subregion complexity [19]. The
second branch, however, is purely imaginary and has tra-
ditionally been excluded because it does not correspond
to a real Lorentzian extremal surface in the AdS bulk.
In the usual treatment, this complex embedding is inter-
preted as unphysical, as it extends beyond the domain of

real-valued minimal surfaces anchored on the boundary.

From the present perspective, however, this “dis-
carded” branch carries deep physical significance. Upon
analytic continuation, it reproduces the timelike extrema!
branch encountered in the study of timelike entanglement
entropy and timelike subregion complexity. The imagi-
nary embedding coordinate € = iV€? + r? corresponds
to a continuation of the minimal surface across the light
cone, thereby encoding the causal extension of the entan-
gling region into the timelike domain. Its contribution is
responsible for the appearance of the imaginary compo-
nent in pseudo-entropy, reflecting phase information as-
sociated with non-unitary or time-reflected evolutions o
he boundary state.

In this sense, the two branches—one real and one
imaginary—are not independent but rather analytic con-
inuations of a unified geometric configuration. The real
ranch represents the standard RT surface probing spa-
ial entanglement, while the imaginary branch extends
he geometry into a “shadow” region of AdS, correspond-
ing to the temporal or causally continued part of the
oundary subregion. This complexified structure natu-
rally bridges spacelike and timelike holographic quanti-
ies: the real branch encodes spatial correlations, whereas
he imaginary branch captures the causal and temporal
entanglement information underlying pseudo-entropy.

Within the framework of holographic complexity for
spacelike subregions, only the real Lorentzian volume
contributes directly to the CV proposal, providing a
real-valued geometric measure of computational depth.
However, the presence of an imaginary extremal branch
suggests that a more general, complexified notion of
holographic complexity may exist—one that unifies spa-
ial and temporal information within a single analytic
structure. Such an extension could naturally connect
holographic complexity, pseudo-entropy, and causal holo-
graphic information through complex AdS embeddings,
offering a richer picture of quantum information geom-
etry in Lorentzian spacetimes. Nonetheless, as our ex-
licit calculations show, even for the timelike subsys-
em—where the extremal configuration includes a time-
ike branch—the resulting complexity remains entirely
real, reflecting the geometric rather than entropic nature
of the CV prescription.

Ill. TIMELIKE SUBREGION COMPLEXITY
FOR ADS BLACK HOLES

It is natural to extend our discussion of timelike subre-
gion complexity to thermal states, which are holograph-
ically dual to AdS black hole or black brane geometries.
In this context, the thermal nature of the boundary state
is encoded in the presence of a horizon, introducing a
new geometric scale that influences the causal structure
of the extremal surfaces. For concreteness, we consider a

(d+2)-dimensional AdS black hole with metric

R? dr? i
ds? = (-20 dt? + Fo + dx? + avi.) . (14)
where
pati

and r;, denotes the horizon radius. The conformal bound-
ary lies at r = 0.

We consider a timelike subregion in the form of a strip
extending along the y; directions but bounded in time by
the finite interval t € [-T'/2,T/2] at fixed spatial coor-
dinate x. Although, unlike the hyperbolic case discussed
in the previous section, this setup lacks a clear interpre-
tation of bulk extremal surface, we can still follow the
general extremization procedure for the area functional
associated with a timelike embedding ¢ = t(r) [9]. The
induced metric on the hypersurface is

R? 1 : .

where ¢/(r) = dt/dr and dY?_, denotes the (d — 1)-
dimensional transverse section. The corresponding area
functional is

with Rg_-1 = Vol(Ya_1)-
Extremizing this functional yields a conserved quan-
tity,

which can be interpreted as an “energy” parameter for
the surface profile t(r). For real-valued t’(r) this constant
must be real; however, for timelike subregions this reality
condition is subtle, and in general no globally real solu-
tion exists unless the extremal surface extends beyond
the horizon.

Besides the trivial solution t’(r) = 0, the presence of
a horizon allows for an extremal surface that penetrates
it, with the turning point ro lying behind the horizon
(ro > rn). This possibility is not merely formal—it
closely parallels the behavior of extremal surfaces in time-
dependent backgrounds such as Vaidya geometries [27],
where the surface crosses horizons to capture causal cor-
relations. Even though our setup is static, the subregion
itself is intrinsically time-dependent, which justifies such
an extension. Under this assumption, the extremal sur-

face satisfies

The leading divergence is proportional to the bound-
ary volume of the subsystem, as expected from the near-
oundary AdS structure. Importantly, the total time-
ike complexity remains real, even when the extremal
surface penetrates the horizon. This behavior contrasts
with that of timelike entanglement entropy, which typ-
ically acquires imaginary contributions associated with
seudo-entropy.
Although we have so far ignored the trivial t/(r) = 0
configuration—corresponding to a constant-time slice ex-
ending from the boundary to the horizon—it is plausible
hat, under certain conditions, a transition could occur
9etween this static branch and the horizon-penetrating
one. Such a transition would resemble phase changes
etween distinct extremal surfaces in the usual entangle-
ment entropy context.

? Technically, evaluating this integral is subtle because the inte-
gration range necessarily crosses the horizon, where the factor
f(r) vanishes and may appear to cause divergences. However,
by carefully splitting the integration domain into two regions—
{e, rp] and [rp;, ro] —and performing the integration on each side
separately, one finds that the potentially divergent contributions
from both sides of the horizon cancel, yielding a finite and smooth
result across the horizon.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this work, we have introduced and systematically
analyzed the notion of timelike subregion complexity
within the holographic CV framework. Motivated by the
pseudo-entropy program, we have extended the study of
holographic complexity from spatial to timelike boundary
regions and evaluated the corresponding bulk volumes for
both pure AdS and AdS black brane geometries.

For timelike hyperbolic regions in pure AdSqa;2, we
showed that the bulk volume enclosed between the space-
like and timelike extremal surfaces remains purely real,
despite the Lorentzian nature of the embedding. This
stands in sharp contrast with the case of pseudo-entropy,
where analytic continuation across the light cone generi-
cally produces an imaginary component. The absence of
any imaginary part in the complexity indicates that the
CV functional retains a genuinely geometric interpreta-
tion even when extended to timelike configurations. In
this sense, timelike complexity measures the accessible
Lorentzian volume bounded by causally admissible sur-
faces, providing a probe of spacetime geometry that is
insensitive to analytic continuation or phase structure.

We then extended our analysis to thermal states dual
to AdS black branes, where the causal structure and the
presence of a horizon introduce new subtleties. In this
case, extremal surfaces can penetrate the horizon, de-
pending on the causal character of the boundary subre-
gion, while a trivial solution corresponding to a constant-
time hypersurface also exists, extending smoothly from
the boundary to the horizon. Remarkably, even when the
extremal surface crosses the horizon, the resulting CV
volume—and hence the subregion complexity—remains
entirely real. This reinforces the interpretation of time-
like complexity as a measure of accessible bulk volume
determined by causal reach rather than analytic contin-
uation. It is also plausible that a transition could oc-
cur between the trivial and horizon-penetrating branches,
signaling a new type of geometric phase structure.

The absence of any imaginary contribution in Cp
suggests that holographic complexity possesses a fun-
damentally different analytic structure from that of
pseudo-entropy. Whereas pseudo-entropy can reflect fea-
tures of transition amplitudes—such as phase informa-
tion—complexity appears to probe the underlying geom-
etry of information itself. Its purely real character indi-
cates that holographic complexity encodes the intrinsic
“depth” or cost of traversing the bulk spacetime, inde-
pendent of any temporal analytic continuation.

This purely real nature is, in fact, not unexpected.
Although the construction originates from the transition
matrix (ip. which is not Hermitian, it remains a well-
posed and meaningful question to ask how “distant” the
final state |7)f) is from the initial state |7);). In this sense,
Cr can be interpreted as quantifying the minimal number
of effective “gates” or operations required to transform
qi) into |r) restricted to a subregion—a quantity that
is naturally real.

Of course, an important open question  re-
mains—namely, how to compute timelike complexity
directly from the boundary field theory. Even for
spatial subregions, a precise field-theoretic definition
of subregion complexity is still lacking, with partial
insights coming from circuit complexity, path-integral
optimization, or tensor-network approaches. Extending
these frameworks to Lorentzian or timelike subregions
poses additional conceptual and technical challenges, as
to}
o}

me must incorporate causal and non-unitary aspects
f boundary dynamics. A consistent field-theoretic
formulation of timelike complexity would thus not only
clarify the operational meaning of our holographic
construction but also reveal how temporal and causal
ructures are encoded in the boundary state space.
We note also that working with timelike entangling re-
gions reveals an intriguing new feature. By relaxing the
hysical boundary conditions on the entangling region,
additional extremal surfaces can emerge, though their
hysical interpretation remains uncertain. In particular,
we could identify a Lorentzian branch with an induced
metric of Lorentzian signature, corresponding to an ex-
remal surface that originates from a point in the bulk
and terminates at the horizon. Such configurations suffer
from infrared divergences, which typically arise from the
near-horizon region of the geometry where the redshift
factor becomes large. In this regime, the integrand of
he corresponding volume or area functional develops a
logarithmic divergence, signaling that the extremal sur-
face probes deep into the infrared part of the bulk space-
ime. Physically, this behavior reflects the accumulation
of contributions from regions close to the horizon, where
he proper volume effectively becomes infinite due to the
warping of the metric. Understanding the precise regu-
arization and physical interpretation of these IR diver-
gences—whether they correspond to long-time or large-
scale phenomena in the dual field theory—remains an
open and interesting question.
Very recently, the paper [28] (see also [29]) appeared,
in which the authors investigated the dynamics of spatial
subregion complexity under time evolution and uncoy-
ered a series of striking behaviors. They showed that
for subsystems larger than half the total system, the
complexity grows linearly for exponentially long times,
whereas for smaller subsystems the growth halts and

eventually reverses, leading to a sharp transition at the
half-size threshold. At finite temperature, additional
critical subsystem sizes emerge, determining whether
the complexity saturates instantaneously or continues to
grow.

Although their setup focuses on spatial subregions
evolving in time, it shares deep conceptual parallels with
our Lorentzian analysis. Both frameworks reveal that
subregion complexity is highly sensitive to causal struc-
ture and the presence of horizons or effective causal bar-
riers. In particular, the sharp transitions identified in
(28) may correspond, in our timelike setup, to transi-
tions between distinct extremal branches—such as the
constant-time and horizon-penetrating surfaces. More-
over, the finite-temperature critical behavior observed
in their study closely parallels our finding that timelike
extremal surfaces exhibit qualitatively different regimes
depending on whether the turning point lies inside the
horizon or corresponds to a static configuration, hinting
at analogous transition phenomena in the timelike CV
framework.

A natural extension of our work, beyond generaliza-
tions to other geometries, would be to formulate and
compute the timelike version of the CA conjecture on
a Wheeler-DeWitt patch anchored to a timelike interval.
Such an analysis could clarify the role of analytic con-
tinuation and illuminate potential phase ambiguities in
Lorentzian holographic complexity. We hope to return
to these questions in future work.
