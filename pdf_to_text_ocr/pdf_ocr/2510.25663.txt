DISSIPATIVE STRUCTURE AND DECAY RATE FOR AN
INVISCID NON-EQUILIBRIUM RADIATION HYDRODYNAMICS

SYSTEM

CORRADO LATTANZIO, RAMON G. PLAZA, AND JOSE M. VALDOVINOS

ABSTRACT. This paper studies the diffusion approximation, non-equilibrium
model of radiation hydrodynamics derived by Buet and Després (J. Quant.
Spectrosc. Radiat. Transf. 85 (2004), no. 3-4, 385-418). The latter de-
scribes a non-relativistic inviscid fluid subject to a radiative field under the
non-equilibrium hypothesis, that is, when the temperature of the fluid is dif-
ferent from the radiation temperature. It is shown that local solutions exist
for the general system in several space dimensions. It is also proved that only
the one-dimensional model is genuinely coupled in the sense of Kawashima
and Shizuta (Hokkaido Math. J. 14 (1985), no. 2, 249-275). A notion of en-
tropy function for non-conservative parabolic balance laws is also introduced.
It is shown that the entropy identified by Buet and Després is an entropy
function for the system in the latter sense. This entropy is used to recast the
one-dimensional system in terms of a new set of perturbation variables and to
symmetrize it. With the aid of genuine coupling and symmetrization, linear
decay rates are obtained for the one dimensional problem. These estimates,
combined with the local existence result, yield the global existence and decay
in time of perturbations of constant equilibrium states in one space dimension.

1. INTRODUCTION

The field of radiation hydrodynami
where (thermal) radiation effects are
motion. While at moderate temperat:

high temperatures the thermal radia‘

cs (cf. [6,36,39]) is concerned with situations
aken into account in the description of fluid
ures the contribution of radiation to the dy-

ion may become comparable or even domi-

nate the fluid state variables, and when this is the case the radiation significantly
affects the dynamics of the fluid. Radiation hydrodynamics finds applications in

various astrophysical phenomena (suc
stellar winds, or nonlinear stellar pu

h as supernova explosions, the description of
sations; see, for example, Kippenhahn and

Weigert [24]), as well as in high-temperature plasma physics (cf. Zel'dovich and

Raizer [48]).
The most general system of equati
hydrodynamics is quite complicated

Radiation, for instance, is described by an assembly of photons, which are massless
particles travelling at the speed of light c, and thus a description in the framework
of special relativity is needed. The radiation is described by a transport equation

for photon distribution with a non-local source term. Coupling the standard hydro-
dynamics equations for a gas and the radiative transfer equation results into a very
complicated system which can be approximated in different physically valid regimes
and, therefore, it is natural to consider reduced models. One of these approximation
regimes is called the diffusion approximation (also called the Eddington approxi-
mation), which quantifies the energy flow due to radiation in a semi-quantitative
sense (cf. [12,13]). This approximation is valid for optically thick fluids for which
he photons emitted by the gas have a high probability of reabsorption. In mos
applications the fluid velocities are small compared to the velocity of light, so the
flow description can be made through the classical Euler hydrodynamics system
and by taking an approximation of order O(v/c), where v is the characteristic ve-
locity of the fluid. It is important to keep terms of order O(v/c) even when |u/c
is small, in order to avoid neglecting the work done by radiation pressure and no
© give rise to an incorrect radiation spectrum (see, e.g., Buchler [4]). Neglecting
erms of order O(v?/c?) is, on the other hand, consistent with using non-relativistic
hydrodynamics equations for the material fluid. Under this point of view, Lowrie et
al. [35] derived a set of equations describing radiation hydrodynamics to which one
can apply Eulerian conservative high-order Godunov-type schemes commonly use

in hydrodynamics [10,27]. The authors applied a simpli

Després [5] performed the same asymptotic analysis

in the diffusion approximation regime in order to derive for the first time the non-
equilibrium diffusion model, that is, when the temperature of the fluid, 6, is differen
rom the temperature of radiation, 0,. This is the physical model that we address
in the present paper. Notably, this limiting model has been rigorously justified in
recent works, both in R® [28] and in a three-dimensional torus [15].

The non-equilibrium diffusion radiation hydrodynamics model derived by Bue
and Després (see system (67) in [5]) reads

Xxp+V- (pu) = 0,

O,(pu) + V+ (pu®u) +V(p+ 4n) =0,
(pL +) + V- ((pE + )u + (p+ 3n)u) = V- (35-0),

oa(04 —n).

Here t > 0 denotes time, x € R¢ denote space variables, with d = 1, 2,3, and V is the
space gradient operator. The unknowns are the density p, the velocity field u € R¢,
the absolute temperature @ of the fluid and the energy of radiation 7 (which is equal
to 64 and depends on the radiation intensity). As usual, p is the thermodynamic
pressure and E = e+|u|?/2 is the total energy of the fluid, with e the internal energy
(per unit mass). The pressure and the internal energy are (smooth) function of the
independent thermodynamic variables p and @, that is, p = p(p,@) and e = e(p,).
The absorption coefficient a, and the scattering coefficient a, are assumed to be
positive constants (for simplicity, the analysis by Buet and Després is made under

the gray hypothesis, that is, constant emissivity across wavelengths). The first three
equations are the usual balance laws describing an inviscid, non-heat-conducting
compressible fluid in which the momentum and energy equations have been modified

accordingly to account for the effect of the radiation energy 7. System (1.1) is a non-
conservative system of hyperbolic-parabolic type, where the only parabolic term is
proportional to An, due to the inviscid and non-heat-conducting nature of the fluid.
Also notice that there are no damping terms, that the only balance term appears
in the radiation equation and that for a constant state (p, a, E,7) to be a solution
it must satisfy 7 = 6+, an equation that defines the equilibrium manifold. System
(1.1) is often referred to as the non-equilibrium-diffusion limit [36,39].

.1. Previous works on the non-equilibrium model. The most studied model
in the context of radiation hydrodynamics is obtained from (1.1) by neglecting
he time derivative for the energy of radiation which, as a consequence, is time-
asymptotically at equilibrium. Thus, the resulting system is an hyperbolic-elliptic
coupled system, and it is also referred to as a non-equilibrium model because the
gas is not in thermodynamical equilibrium. There is a vast mathematical literature
concerning these hyperbolic-elliptic coupled models which we will not review here;
for an abridged list of references see [5, 17-19, 25, 26, 29-32, 34, 42-45]. In contrast,
he evolution non-equilibrium model (1.1) has been less analyzed. In most cases,
he model is further endowed with physical fluid viscosities [12, 14,23, 46], or with
damping terms [2,3]. For instance, Jiang et al. [14] showed the global (in time)
existence and uniqueness of solution for the one-dimensional initial-boundary value
roblem of a viscous and heat-conducting fluid, for suitable smooth initial data
and when the heat conductivity satisfies a physical growth condition with respect
o the fluid temperature. The model studied by Jiang et al. has been subsequently
studied in other works. Jiang [12] established the global well-posedness in Sobolev
spaces for the Cauchy problem in the perturbation framework in the case of the
3d-polytropic ideal gas system, and obtained the convergence rate (1 + t)~9/4 for
he H%(R3)—norm of solutions when the initial data belongs to L1(R*). Simi-
ar results have been obtained by Wang et al. [46], where the authors have used
Littlewood-Paley decomposition. Later Kim et al. [23] extended the previous re-
sults to more general fluids, and have also obtained the decay rate (1+t)~*/? of the
HN (R*)—norm (N > 3) of the solutions when the initial data belongs to the ho-
mogeneous negative Sobolev space H~*(IR°), for s € [0, 1/2]. We also mention the
work by Jiang and Zhou [13], where they have established the local well-posedness
of smooth solutions for the 3d polytropic gas case of the same model studied by
Jiang et al. [14], in which viscous and heat-conduction effect for the fluid are ig-
nored and the radiation pressure term is considered but only for the momentum
balance equation, that is, a term proportional to V(4n) is incorporated.
Regarding the models with damping, Blanc et al. [2] established the global in
time existence of solutions to the Cauchy problem for the system (1.1) in three
dimensions with damping and heat conduction effects for the fluid, provided the
initial data is a small perturbation of a constant equilibrium state. The authors
in [2] have also obtained the same results for the equilibrium-diffusion limit, that
is, system (1.1) where 77 is replaced by 64 and there is no equation for the energy
of radiation.

To sum up, although there are several works that studied the well-posedness
of the non-equilibrium-diffusion limit system, most of them do not consider the
original inviscid, non-heat-conducting and non-damped system (1.1) derived by
Buet and Deprés [5].

1.2. The contributions of this work. In the present work we are interested in
the global (in time) existence of solutions for the Cauchy problem of system (1.1)
with initial data being a small perturbation of a constant equilibrium state, and
study their asymptotic behaviour. In our study, we combine local (in time) exis-
tence of solutions results with a priori energy estimates and (nonlinear) decay rates
of the local solution, via an continuation argument to get the global existence and
asymptotic behaviour of solutions. For the local existence of solutions we apply a
result by Kawashima [16] for hyperbolic-parabolic system of composite type. For
obtaining the a priori energy estimates as well as the decay rates, we employ a tech-
nique developed in the same work of Kawashima [16] and that consists in studying
the dissipative structure of the linear system around the constant equilibrium state.
The dissipative structure mentioned above refers to the fact that the system
es any of the properties stated in Theorem 2.1 below. As those properties are
equivalent, the genuine coupling condition, which is straightforward to verify, tells
us that in order to posses this structure, the system needs to have enough dissipation

due to “relaxation” (zero-order space derivatives terms) and “viscosity” (second-
order space derivatives) mechanisms. For the linear version around a constant
equilibrium state of system (1.1), it turns out that the one-dimensional space system
has enough dissipation, but this fails to be the case when the space dimension is

d > 2 (see Appendix B). Thus, in the present work we consider the one-dimensional
case because of this technicality.

It should be noted that our results can be easily extended to the several space
dimensions case if we take into consideration damping, as it has been done in [2], or
viscosity effects for the fluid in system (1.1). In this sense, our results complement

hose of Blanc et al. [2], as we also provide decay rates for the solutions. Notably,
he authors use the compensating matrix K, given by the Equivalence Theorem
2.1, for performing some energy estimates but not for obtaining the decay rates, as
we do it in the present work. In addition, although one might think that the one
dimensional case is easier to handle, this is not the case at the time of performing

he nonlinear energy estimate for getting the a priori energy estimates and the decay
rates. In order to do so, the system has to be written in a very specific way and this
is related to the existence of an entropy function/flux entropy pair (see [16, Chapter
IV] or [22, Section 7]), which is the case for the system under consideration and
hat we explain in detail below; see Section 3. It turns out that the entropy that
works for system (1.1) is the classical one for the fluid plus the entropy associated
to radiation and which was proposed by Buet and Després; see [5, Corollary 2],
or equation (3.15) below. Up to the authors’ knowledge this entropy structure of
system (1.1) has not been reported in previous works.

1.3. Equations and assumptions. In this paper we consider the non-equilibrium
system of equations (1.1) describing a non-relativistic inviscid fluid under the effects
of radiation. It is a non-conservative system in Eulerian variables and in several

space dimensions. Substituting the equation for the energy of the radiation into
the energy equation and performing some straightforward algebra, it is possible
to recast system (1.1) as the following equivalent system (details are left to the
reader):

O,(pu) + V+ (pu®u) +V(p+ $n) =0,

On+tV-(qu=V- (sz Vn) 4 oa(6* — 7) — anV U.
(1.2)
In the forthcoming analysis, system (1.2) will often appear more suitable for our
needs and we shall be working with both variants of the physical model almost
without distinction.
Let us state the physical assumptions for system (1.1) (or equivalently, for system
(1.2)) under consideration in this paper.

(H,) The independent thermodynamic variables are the density p > 0 and the
absolute temperature 6 > 0. They take values in convex open set

D={(p,0): p>0, @> 0}.

(Hz) The thermodynamic pressure p, the internal energy (per unit mass) of the
fluid e, and the specific entropy of the fluid s are smooth functions of p and
6, that is p, e, and s € C*(D). They satisfy

p>0, pp>0, pa>0, e9 >0, (1.3)

as well as the volumetric First Law of Thermodynamics

p

which implies the relations

ep = (p—Ope)/p”, 8» =—pe/p’, 89 = €0/0. (1.4)

(H3) The absorption coefficient a, and the scattering coefficiente a, are positive
constants.

Remark 1.1. Notice that, for convenience, we have chosen p and @ as the indepen-
dent thermodynamic variables. In addition, it is to be observed that the hypotheses
(1.3) on the thermodynamic potentials p and e are quite general and satisfy the
conditions for an arbitrary Weyl fluid [47], namely, a generalized Gay-Lussac’s law
(po > 0), adiabatic increase of pressure effects compression (pp > 0) and the in-
crease of internal energy due to an increase of temperature at constant volume
(eo > 0). A typical example is that of an ideal gas satisfying
RO

p(p,0) = Rp, —e(p,0) = yaT?
where R > 0 is the universal gas constant and y > 1 is the adiabatic exponent.
In radiation hydrodynamics one may consider other types of potentials which fall
under the category of Weyl; see [6,36,39] for further information.

As we have already mentioned, we specialize our stability analysis to the case
of one space dimension (d = 1). Hence, let us write the one-dimensional version of

system (1.1):

Op + 0; (pu) = 0,

1.4. Main result. Let us now state the main result of the paper.

Theorem 1.2 (global existence and time asymptotic decay). Suppose hypotheses
(H,) - (Hg) hold. Let V = (p, 7, 0,7) € R* be a constant equilibrium state satisfying
7p, 9,7 > 0, = 7. Assume that Vy —V © (A(R) n L+(R))* with s > 3. Then
there exists a positive constant ¢ > 0 such that if
I|Vo — Vlls + Vo - V1lza Se, (1.6)
then the Cauchy problem for system (1.5) with initial condition V(0) = Vo has a
unique global solution V(x,t) = (p,u,9,)(x,t) satisfying

p—p,u-U,0—8 € C((0, 00); H*(R)) NC! ((0,00); H*"1(R)) ,

Moreover, the solution satisfies

as well as
I(V —V)()[s—1 $ CO+ t)-MA(IIVo —V]ls-1 + ||Yo — Vili), (1.8)
for allt > 0 and for some uniform constant C > 0.

Remark 1.3. It is to be observed that Theorem 1.2 establishes the global well-
posedness of classical solutions (thanks to the Sobolev embedding) to the non-
equilibrium diffusion limit system (1.1) in the perturbation framework and in one
space dimension. The constant state is supposed to belong to the equilibrium
manifold (that is, it satisfies a= 7), although the system itself is in the non-
equilibrium regime. The initial (perturbation) conditions are assumed to have
finite energy (Vj — V € H*(R)*, s > 3) and finite mass (Vj — V € L1(R)*). If the
initial perturbations are sufficiently small then global classical solutions exist and
decay as t + oo. Theorem 1.2 also determines rates of decay for the perturbation
variables of algebraic type.

Plan of the paper. In Section 2 we recall the notions of strict dissipativity and
genuine coupling, and state the local existence result and their consequences (local
energy estimates). In Section 3 we extend the definition of entropy to the case of
non-conservative viscous balance laws, symmetrize the system and define the new
perturbation variables. Section 4 examines the linear dissipative structure of the
system in the new variables and establishes the desired linear decay rates. The
last Section 5 is devoted to closing the nonlinear energy estimates and to the proof
of the main Theorem 1.2. We make some final comments in the dicussion Section
6. In addition, we have included three Appendices. Appendix A states the local
existence theorem in several space dimensions. In Appendix B we prove that the
DISSIPATIVITY AND DECAY FOR A RADIATION HYDRODYNAMICS SYSTEM 7

system is not genuinely coupled when the dimension is d > 2. Appendix C contains
a spectral analysis of the generated semigroup, which is needed for some of the
energy estimates in Section 4.

2. PRELIMINARIES

In this section we present some preliminary material. Section 2.1 contains
the definition of strict dissipativity and the Equivalence Theorem by Shizuta and
Kawashima [40] for second order systems (see Theorem 2.1 below). In Section 2.2
we state the local (in-time) existence of solutions to the Cauchy problem for system
(1.1) in one space dimension and with initial data close to a constant equilibrium
state. This result is a consequence of a more general theorem by Kawashima [16]
(see Theorem A.1 below). In Section 2.3 we present some a priori energy estimates
for the local solutions.

2.1. Strict dissipativity and the Equivalence Theorem. Consider a linear
second order system in any space dimension d > 1 of the form

d d
AU, + 3° AU 2, FLV = SO BYU zy24, (2.1)
j=l gik=L

where U = U(a,t) € R” is the vector of state variables, and x € R¢ and t > 0
represent space and time, respectively. The coefficients A°, AJ, L and B’*, j,k =

1,...,d, are constant square real matrices of order n satisfying:
(A1) A°, AY, 7 =1,
(Ag) L, BY", j,k =1,..
and the symbol ‘ae wj wp, BIF is positive semi-definite for all w € S¢~!.

following Equivalence Theorem by Shizuta and Kawashima [40].
8 C. LATTANZIO, R. G. PLAZA, AND J. M. VALDOVINOS

Theorem 2.1 (equivalence theorem [40]). Under assumptions (Ai) — (Ag), the
following statements are equivalent:

(i) For each € € R*, € £0, the real part of \ = X(E), solutions of (2.3), satisfy
Re A <0.

ii) For any p € R", w 4 0, satisfying B(w)p = Lw = 0 for some w € S41,

where [M|* denotes the symmetric part of the matrix M, that is [M]* =

(iv) There exists a positive constant c such that there holds

for \ = X(€) solution of (2.3), for all € E R¢, € 40.

When the system (2.1) satisfies (i) in Theorem 2.1 we say that the system is
strictly dissipative, and if (ii) holds true we say that the system satisfies the genuine
coupling condition or to be genuinely coupled. The matrix K in Theorem 2.1 (iii)
is known as a compensating matrix for the system (2.1).

Remark 2.2. The seminal work by Kawashima and Shizuta [20,40] established the
conditions for the strict dissipativity of a large number of second order systems (such
as linearizations around constant states of the Navier-Stokes and the Navier-Stokes-
Fourier models). Thanks to the Equivalence Theorem 2.1, the genuine coupling
condition (which is an algebraic condition) implies the existence of compensating
matrix functions which are very useful to obtain energy decay estimates at the linear
level. These estimates can be applied to the nonlinear problem around constant
states or even around small amplitude shock profiles.

2.2. Local existence. Consider the one-dimensional non-equilibrium diffusion ra-
diation hydrodynamics system (1.5) and define the state variables

V(a,t) == (0,u,0,n)(2,1),
which belong to the set
V:= {(p,u,0,n) €R*: p> Ci, 8 > Co, n> C3}, (2.4)

for some fixed (but arbitrary) positive constants C;, i = 1,2,3. We now pose the
initial value problem of system (1.5) with initial data

V(x, 0) = Vo(x) = (po, uo, 80, M0) (x). (2.5)
For system (1.5), the equilibrium manifold is defined by
Ueq = {V EV: 9 =O};
DISSIPATIVITY AND DECAY FOR A RADIATION HYDRODYNAMICS SYSTEM 9

for more details, see Section 3. Let us fix a constant equilibrium state V =

(p, U, 8,77) € Ueq of system (1.5), satisfying thus the relation

7=9.

Then the local existence of perturbations of such equilibrium state is given by the
next result.

Theorem 2.3. Let V = (p,U, 0,7) € Ueq be a constant equilibrium state for system
(1.5). Consider the initial value problem (1.5) and (2.5) with Vo -V € H*(R)},
5 > 2. Then there exists ¢ > 0 such that if

a:=|Yo-Vls <e,

then we have that for m1 < po(x) < Mi, m2 < O0(x) < M2, m3 < no(x) < M3 for
all x € R and positive constants 0 < m; < Mj, i =1,2,3, and for some To = To(a),
there exists a unique solution V(x,t) to the initial value problem satisfying

p—p,u-U,0—-0€C((0, To]; H*(R)) NC! ([0, 7]; H*-*(R)) , jas)
n-HE C ((0, To]; H°(R)) NC? ((0, To]; H*7(R)) . ,

Moreover, the following estimate

sup lw Tre f \|O.(p, u,)(T)II5-1 + Oxn(r)|I$ ar < CollVo— VIS. (2.7)

O<r<t
holds for all t € [0,7] and for some positive constant Co depending on ||Vo — V|\s-

Remark 2.4. It is to be observed that, since s > 2, the continuous embedding
H*(R) c L®(R) implies that for sufficiently small initial data the solution V =

and will be such that
™1 < p(v,t) < Mi, M2 < O(x,t) < Mo, M3 < n(a,t) < Ms,

for all 2 € R and ¢ € [0,75], and some uniform positive constant ™m; and M;,
i = 1,2,3, so that V(a,t) € V, with V as in (2.4) for some positive constants
C; = Ci(a), i =1,2,3.

Motivated by the energy estimate (2.7), for any local solution on a time interva
[0,7] of the Cauchy problem (1.5) and (2.5), we define
E,(t):= sup |(V —V)(r)Iks, (2.8
O<r<t
t
F(t) = [ \|Ox(p, u, O)(r)I—1 + Oen(7)II5 ar, (2.9
as well as
N,(t)? = E,(t) + F,(t), (2.10

for any t € [0,7].

2.3. A priori energy estimates. Next, we enunciate some a priori energy es-
timates for the local solution of the Cauchy problem of system (1.5) with initial
data Vo(x) close to a constant equilibrium state V = (p,U, 0,77) € Ueq. As we have
already mentioned, we invoke a general result by Kawashima [16] in order to obtain
such estimates. For that purpose, we verify that the linearized system around the
constant equilibrium state V satisfies the genuine coupling condition.

We start by writing the linear system around V, which is just the one-dimensional
version of the linear system (B.1) in Appendix B, and it reads

Here we have used the equilibrium relation 7 = a; see expressions (B.2)-(B.5) in
Appendix B for more details. From the expression above for B, we clearly have
that

ker (B) = span{(1,0,0,0), (0, 1,0, 0), (0,0, 1,0)}.
DISSIPATIVITY AND DECAY FOR A RADIATION HYDRODYNAMICS SYSTEM 11

Regarding TZ and in view that 7 = a, one can easily verify that the third and
fourth rows of L are linearly dependent, so that dim ker (Z) = 3. Since the vec-
tors (1,0,0,0), (0,1,0,0) and (0, 0,1,40°) are linearly independent and belong to
ker (Z), we have that

ker (Z) = span{(1,0,0,0), (0, 1,0,0), (0,0, 1,40°)}.
Thus, there holds
ker (Z) O ker (B) = span{(1,0,0,0), (0, 1,0,0)},

implying that ~ € ker (Z) O ker (B), w # 0, if and only if ¢ is of the form wy =
(a1, @2,0,0) with a; and a2 not simultaneously equal to zero. Hence, for vectors
of this form we have that

Let us assume that for some pp € R, uA ~+A y = 0. As 0, 77, and Py > 0, from the
above computations we conclude that az = 0. Now, as p, > 0, the second column
. . =0 30. . .

in the expression for ~A y+ A yw implies that a; = 0, which contradicts the fact
that ~ 4 0. Thus, we have proved the following result.

Lemma 2.5. Under assumptions (H,) — (H3), the one dimensional linear system
(2.12) satisfies the genuine coupling condition.

The lemma above and the Equivalence Theorem 2.1 imply the existence of a
compensating matrix K for system (2.12). Then we have the following a priori
energy estimate for the solutions of the initial value problem (1.5)-(2.5).

Lemma 2.6. Let us consider the Cauchy problem (1.5) and (2.5), with Vo(«)
satisfying Vo - V € H*(R)*, s > 2. Let V(a,t) be a local solution on a time
interval {0,T], then there exists a constant ag such that if

Ns(T) < ao,

then there holds the a apriori energy estimate

for every t € [0,T], and some positive constant C, = C,(ag). Here P* denotes the
orthogonal projection onto the range of L.

Proof. See the proof of Lemma 3.1 in [16].

Lemma 2.7. Under the same assumptions as in Lemma 2.6 and for the same ao,
there exists a constant Cz = C2(ao) such that as long as

N,(T) < ao
12 C. LATTANZIO, R. G. PLAZA, AND J. M. VALDOVINOS

is satisfied, the following energy estimate

(2.14)
holds for t € [0,T]. As in Lemma 2.6, P+ is the orthogonal projection on the range
of L.

Proof. See the proof of Lemma 3.2 in [16].

Remark 2.8. Lemmata 2.6 and 2.7 are essentially restatements of Lemmata 3.1
and 3.2 in [16], respectively. In this subsection we have simply verified that system
(1.5) satisfies the underlying hypotheses.

Remark 2.9. Notice that estimates (2.13) and (2.14) are not sufficient to get the
global existence of solutions. For instance, if we multiply estimate (2.14) by a > 0
and add it to estimate (2.13), where a is such that aC2 < 1, we arrive at

for some C > 0. However, in the left-hand side of the inequality above we are
missing the terms ||(V —V)(t)|| and fo \|0,,V (r)||8 dr to obtain an energy estimate
as the one given =~ Moot A.l.

In the next section we perform a change of perturbation variables which will allow
us to close the a priori energy estimates. The latter will eventually lead to the decay
rate in time of solutions, which is a fundamental information not contained in the
statements of Lemmata 2.6 and 2.7.

3. ENTROPY AND SYMMETRIZATION

In this section we perform a change of variables to recast system (1.1). The
system in the new variables has some features that allow us to obtain a sharp linear
energy estimate, which is needed to close the nonlinear analysis. This change o
variables is motivated by the notion of an entropy function for a viscous system o:
conservation laws [16,20] and that of for a system of balance laws [21,22]. These
definitions are extensions of the classical notion of an entropy function for hyperbolic
systems of conservation laws first introduced by Godunov [8] and by Friedrichs anc

Lax [7].

3.1. Entropies for non-conservative viscous balance systems. Let us star’
by recalling the case of hyperbolic balance laws. Consider a system of the form

W.+ f!(W)x = Q(W). (3.1
Here x € R and t > 0 denote, respectively, the space and time variables. W =
(Wi,...,Wn) represents the vector of quantities under examination taking values

in an open convex set Ow C R”. The flux function f! and Q are smooth functions
of W with values in R”.
Let us define the sets

M := {W ER": (Y,Q(W)) =0, for all W € Ow}
DISSIPATIVITY AND DECAY FOR A RADIATION HYDRODYNAMICS SYSTEM 13

and
Ocqg = {W € Ow : Q(W) = 0}.
We have the following definitions.

Definition 3.1. We say that system (3.1) has an entropy function if there exists
a function S : Ow — R satisfying the following properties:

(a) S isa strictly convex function of W, that it, its Hessian D?,,S(W) is positive

definite.

(b) For W € Ow the matrix

Dw f'(W)DyS(W)-* (3.2)
is symmetric.

(c) Let W € Ow, then W € Ogg if and only if DwS(W)' € M.

(d) For W € Ogg, the matrix DwQ(W)D?,S(W)~' is symmetric and non-
positive definite, and its null space coincides with M.

One consequence of the existence of an entropy for system (3.1) is that we can
write it in symmetric form. To this end, let S be an entropy of system (3.1) in the
sense just defined above. Therefore, the mapping

U(W) := DwS(W)" (3.3)

is a diffeomorphism from Ow onto Oy = U(Oyw) (this is a consequence of property
(a)). Thus if we use W = W(U) in (3.1) we obtain

A°(U)U, + Al(U)Uy = h(U), (3.4)
where 7
A°(U) = DuyW(U), (3.5)
MU) := Du f'(U) = Dwf(W(U))DuWU), ,
and

AU) = QW(U)).
Since Dy W(U) = D?,,S(W(U))~* because of (3.3), we have that

AY) = Diy S(W(U)),
ANU) = Dw fh (WW))Di-S(W(D)) 7,

which are symmetric matrices with A° > 0.

The radiation hydrodynamics system under consideration is a set of viscous
balance laws with non-conservative terms. Hence, let us consider a generic system
of the form

W, + f'(W). = (G(W)W,), + C(W)W, + Q(W), (3.6)
where G and C are smooth function of W with values in R"*". Consequently,
we modify Definition 3.1 to account for non-conservative viscous balance systems
having this form. In particular, we replace condition (b) by

(b’) For W € Oy, the matrix (Dw f'(W) — C(W)) Dj, S(W)~! is symmetric,
and add a new condition for the viscous term:

(e) For W € Ow, G(W) Dj, S(W)* is symmetric and positive semi-definite.
14 C. LATTANZIO, R. G. PLAZA, AND J. M. VALDOVINOS

Definition 3.2. We say that system (3.6) has an entropy function if there exists
a function S : Ow — R satisfying the conditions (a), (b’), (c), (d) and (e) above.
3.2. Entropy for non-equilibrium radiation hydrodynamics. Now, we shal
verify that the entropy function proposed by Buet and Després [5] “almost” satisfies
Definition 3.2 for the one-dimensional version of system (1.1). Indeed, regarding
condition (b’), it will hold only for W € Ogg. Although this may seem as a difficulty,
it turns out that it is sufficient for our purposes, as we shall see in the sequel. Le
us start by writing the system under consideration as

Hp + Ax(pu) = 0,
O,(pu) + Ox (pu? + (p+ 4n)) = 0,
d;(pE) + On (pEu t (p t 4n)u) oa(04 = n) n dnue,
Om + Oy(Nu) = s4-Nee + Fa(8* — m) — F1Ue,

(3.9

which is the one dimensional version of system (1.2). Here the variables describing
the fluid are the mass density p, the scalar velocity u, the pressure p, the tota
energy E and the absolute temperature @, while 7 is the radiation intensity. The
absorption coefficient oq and the scattering coefficient a, are, once again, positive
constants.

Clearly, this system is written in the form (3.6) for the conserved quantities
W := (p,m,€,7) = (p, pu, pE,n) and with the notations

un/(3p) —n/(3p) 0 0

Notice that G is a constant matrix. In the definitions above, we understand u =
m/p, while p and @ are functions of W. This is indeed the case if we choose p and
e as thermodynamic variables (see Remark 1.1) so that we have
p=plp.e), 9=(p,e),
and as
E€ =pE = p(e+u’/2), (3.11)
we can write e = e(p,m, €), implying that

p=v(p,m,E), 8=O6(p,m,€). (3.12)
DISSIPATIVITY AND DECAY FOR A RADIATION HYDRODYNAMICS SYSTEM 15

The non conservative term C(W)W,, will play a crucial role in the sequel. It clearly
comes from the differentiation

m m 1 U 1
Uz Pax + —Mz —Px + —Me.
Ply p Pp Pp p

Finally, the sets M and Ogg are given, respectively, by
M = span {(1,0,0,0), (0,1,0, 0), (0,0,1,1)}, (3.13)
and
Ocg = {WE Ow: n=H1(W)}. (3.14)

As stated before, the variables we use to symmetrize the system are connected
with the entropy functions of the model. In our case we consider the entropy
function proposed by Buet and Després (see Corollary 2 in [5]), namely

4
S = —pe— gins (3.15)

The quantity $n°/ 4 is formally the radiative (physical) entropy at equilibrium. The
function s appearing in (3.15) denotes the specific entropy (per unit mass) of the
fluid and, as in the case of p and @ in (3.12), it is understood as a function of W
which satisfies

Sp =—po/p’, 89 = €0/8. (3.16)

It turns out that the function S defined above works as a (mathematical) entropy
for our system in the sense of Definition 3.2, where, as already pointed out, con-
dition (b’) will hold only at equilibrium. We claim, for instance, that the needed
symmetrizer is given by the Hessian of the entropy function, D?,,S(W).

Remark 3.3. Given that the pressure p, the internal energy e and the specific
entropy s are related through the thermodynamic relations (1.4) when p and @ are
chosen as independent thermodynamic variables, it is more convenient to perform
our computations by introducing the (non conserved) variables V := (p,u, 6,17).
Then, the expression (3.11) defines a diffeomorphism W = W(V) and the differen-
tiation with respect to W is performed using the chain rule involving the matrix

DwV(W) = DyW(V) |) va , where

)?
1 0 oO 0
y _ u p 0 0

which is clearly non-singular. A direct computation then yields

i _ —u/p 1/p 0 0
DyW(V)" = | (tu? —e—pep)/(pe0) —u/(peo) 1/(oeo) 0
0 0 0 1

Finally, we obtain

DyS(W(V)) = ( — 8 — ps,,0, —pso, -1/n'/4),

Dyf'(V)= u(e + 4u?) + PUEp + Ppt ple t gu?) tpu-+tptn/3 pueg+pou u/3

In view of the above remark, by the chain rule we have that
DwS(W) = DyS(V(W))DwV(W) = DyS(V(W))DyW(V) "vay:
Thus, after some straightforward computations and using relations (1.4) we obtain

—s+(e-—u?/2+p/p)/0

-1/0
-1/n/4

O(V) := U(W(V)) = DwS(W(V))' = (3.17)

where U is as in (3.3). From this expression it is easy to see that for W € Ow,

W € Ocg if and only if DwS(W)! € M. This is true because, if W € Ocq, then

7 = 6*, which means that the third and fourth entries of DyS(W)' are the same.

Next, we are going to show that D?,,S(W) is positive definite. Once again, we
verify this fact indirectly, using that W = W(V). The chain rule implies that

Diy S(W) = DwU(W) = DyO(V(W))DwV(W) tai)

Now, let us define the matrix

From the expression for the coefficients a24, @34, @42, and a43 is easy to see that
A'(U) is symmetric as long as 7 = 6+, that is, for W € Oeq. This shows that
condition (b’) is satisfied for W € Og. Observe that in (3.20) we have redefined
the expression for A'(U) in (3.5) in order to account for the non-conservative term
18 C. LATTANZIO, R. G. PLAZA, AND J. M. VALDOVINOS

that appears in (3.6). To compute DwQ(W)D},S(W)~! we proceed in the same
fashion as we did for the term Dw f!(W)D?,S(W)71. This yields
DwQ(W)DiS(W)* = DvQ(V(W))Dve(v(W))

which is non-positive definite for W € Oeg and its null space coincides with M

Finally, let us compute G(W)D?,,S(W). For that purpose we use the relation
for D?,,S(W) given by (3.18) and obtain

G(W)DiyS(W)7? = GDyW(V)|veviwyDvO(V(W)) 7

which is clearly positive semi-definite. Thus, we have shown that S given by (3.15)

3.3. New perturbation variables. Next, let us consider a constant state W €
Ocg and define
Z:= DuW(U)"'(W -W), (3.22)
where U = U(W). Thus W —W = Dy W(0)Z. Now observe that
L(W)2 = Dw S'(W)(W We + (FW) — f'(W) — Dw (W)(W -W)),

and

QW) = DwQ(W)(W —W) + (Q(W) - Q(W) — DwQ(W)(W —- W))

= DwQ(W)DuW(W)Z + (Q(W) — Q(W) — DwQ(W)(W —W)).

Then system (3.9) transforms into

Essentially, in order to obtain system (3.23) one multiplies system (3.6) on the left
by the Hessian of the entropy function evaluated at U.

Remark 3.4. It is worth observing that the special shape of the non conservative
terms implies in particular that the full quantity g belongs to M+, where M is the
orthogonal space of Q(W); see (3.13). This feature will be crucial in the sequel, to
obtain the improved linear decay rate established by Lemma 4.5 below.

To sum up, we collect the previous observations into the following result.

Proposition 3.5. The Hessian of the entropy function S defined in (3.15) is a
symmetrizer for the linearization of system (3.9) around a constant equilibrium
state and through the change of variables defined in (3.22).

To finish this section we state a result (without proof) that relates the solutions to
the Cauchy problem (1.5) and (2.5) with the ones for system (3.23) with initial data
Zo corresponding to the initial data Vo for (1.5) through the change of variables
(3.22). The proof of the result is based on the following observation. We have
already mentioned that the correspondence V ++ W defines a diffeomorphism; see
Remark 3.3 above. Thus for V close to V we can write

W-W=DyW(V.)(V —V),

which, in turn, implies that

Z = DyW(U)(W — W) = DupW(U) Dy W(V.)(W -W),

for some V, between V and V. Then, if the solutions V remain close to V. (see
Remark 2.4), so do the variables W and W, and from the expressions above we get

that Sobolev norms for any two of the three perturbed variables V—V, W —W
and Z are equivalent. For more details, see the proof of Lemma 3.7 in [38].

20 C. LATTANZIO, R. G. PLAZA, AND J. M. VALDOVINOS

Proposition 3.6. Assume (H,) —- (H3) and consider the initial value problem of
system (1.5) with initial data Vo(x) such that Vo —V € H*(R)*, s > 3. Let V(z,t)
be the local solution in the interval [0,T|, T > 0, which is given by Theorem 2.8.
Then the new perturbation variables

Z(w,t) = DuWO)(W(V(2,t)) - WV)
solve system (3.23) with initial data
Zo(2) = Z(#,0) = Du W(O)(WVo(2)) - WV).

In addition, the following relations hold:

(i) There exist positive constants co, Co such that
coll(V —V) (lle < IZ@llx < Coll(V -— V@)|lx,

for all0 <k <s, andt € (0,T).
(ii) There exist constants c;, C > 0 such that

for al0 <k <s, andt € (0,7).
(iii) If, in addition, the initial perturbation satisfies Vy — V € L'(IR)*, so does
the initial data for the system in Z, and there holds

|Zollz2 < CllVo — Vln,

for some constant C > 0.

4. DISSIPATIVE STRUCTURE AND LINEAR DECAY RATE OF SOLUTIONS

As we have already mentioned at the end of Section 2, we need an additional
energy estimate to get the correct a priori estimate and to complete the nonlinear
analysis. To this end, in this section we examine the dissipative structure of the
system at the linear level, which will also imply the linear decay rate of solutions.
These linear properties play a key role to obtain the desired a priori estimate and
the decay rate of the solutions for the full nonlinear system.

It is to be noticed that we could have performed the analysis in the system
written in the variables V. Indeed, the computations prior to the statement of
Lemmata 2.6 and 2.7 imply the dissipative structure of the system. However, we
need a sharper linear energy estimate to close the nonlinear one and this is possible
only if we work with the set of variables identified in the previous Section 3.3.

4.1. Dissipative structure of the linear system. Let us start by recalling the
system that we obtained in Section 3. Let us fix a constant state V. To this
constant state corresponds a (unique) constant state in the conserved variables
W = (p, pu, pE,n) which we denote by W; see Section 3, Remark 3.3. Thus the
system in the new perturbed variables reads

PR AA Det LE = Ble + Ge, (4.1)
where

Z=DyW(U)(W -W),

with U being the gradient with respect to W of the entropy function of the fluid,
and U = U(W). The (constant) matrix coefficients are given by

satisfies the genuine coupling condition. To this end, observe that, from the expres-
sion for L and B, it is easy to verify that

ker L Aker B = span {(1,0, 0,0), (0,1,0,0)}.

Then if w € ker LO ker B, w #0, then ~ is of the form ~ = (a1, a2,0,0) with a,
and az not being simultaneously zero. Thus we have

pa1p 0/D, + parpt/D, + a1 11 + G2412

pA + Ady _ pa, puo/D, + Ha2(1 + w/B,) : a1a12 + agd20 | (4.6)

Let us assume that pA + Aly = 0, for py = (ay, a2,0,0) 4 0. Then, as a4 =
49° /3, we conclude that az = 0. Using this, the first row of (4.6) implies that

0 Harp 0/D, + a1 G11 arp 9/D, + a1pu/D,,
22 C. LATTANZIO, R. G. PLAZA, AND J. M. VALDOVINOS
so that yp = —u. However, if we use this relation for the expression in the second
row of (4.6) we obtain

0 = p01 pU8/p, + a1d12 = —ai pw O/p, + apO(1 + /p,) = apd,
which holds only if a; = 0 as B, 6 > 0 and this contradicts the fact that p 4 0.
Therefore we have proved that for any w € ker L ker B, w 4 0, it holds

pAy+ Aly 40, WWeR.

We summarize the computations above in the following result.
Proposition 4.1. The linear system (4.5) satisfies the genuine coupling condition.

As a consequence of the Equivalence Theorem, there exists a compensating ma-
trix for system (4.5) which can be used, in turn, to obtain the following pointwise
energy estimate in the Fourier space for the solution of system (4.5). This is a
standard result that can be found in [1, 16].

Lemma 4.2. The solutions Z(x,t) of the linear system (4.5) satisfy the estimate

Sat) (26.0), (4.7)

for all€ € R andt > 0, with some positive constants C and k. Here Z denotes the
Fourier transform of Z.

I2(g,1)| < Cexp (-

Proof. See the proof of Lemma 3.A.1 in [16], or that of Lemma 5.1 in [1].

4.2. Linear decay of solutions. In this section we obtain the decay rate of solu-
tions to the linear system (4.5). This is a direct consequence of the pointwise energy
estimate (4.7) in the Fourier space upon application of Plancherel’s Theorem. For
instance, estimate (4.7) directly yields the following result, which establishes a lin-
ear decay rate for the solutions. We omit its proof because it can be easily obtained
using the arguments of Lemma 4.5 below, which contains an improved decay rate.

Lemma 4.3. Let us consider the Cauchy problem for system (4.5) with initial data
Zo(a) € (H8(R)N Lt (R))’, for s>0. Then for each fixed 0 < € < s there holds

Now we define

Then (e'®h) (2) is the solution to the Cauchy problem of (4.5) with initial condition
Zo =h. Thus the estimate (4.8) can be rewritten as follows.

Corollary 4.4. For h € (H°(R)N LiR))*, s>0, we have the following estimate

Next, we follow [22] and improve estimate (4.8) in the case when h € M+, where
M is the null space of L.

This last estimate is going to play an important role in the establishment of the
nonlinear energy estimate on the system (3.23), where we use the fact that ¢ € M+;
see (3.25) and the subsequent Remark 3.4.

5. GLOBAL WELL-POSEDNESS AND DECAY RATE OF SOLUTIONS

Once the linear decay of solutions from the previous section is obtained, we are
in a position to perform the nonlinear energy estimate which, in turn, will allow
us to close the a priori energy estimate and to get the decay rate of solutions to
the nonlinear problem. We get the estimate for the perturbed variable Z, which is
also valid for the conserved perturbed variables W — W as well as for V — V, in
view of Proposition 3.6. Here W = (p, pu, pE,n) and V = (p,u,0,7), while W =
(P, PU, DE,7) € Ogg is the (unique) constant equilibrium state which corresponds to

ia ros aR os * P a4 _ * ‘
the constant state V = (p,U, 0,7) satisfying @ = 7, and vice versa; in other words,
the invertible map W = W(V) maps Ueg into Ocg back and forth; see Remark 3.3
in Section 3.

5.1. Nonlinear energy estimate. Let us start by taking V = (p,0,0,7) € Ueq,
a constant equilibrium state. As previously explained, we can rewrite system (1.5)
linearized around V as in (4.1) in a new set of variables:

AZ, + AZ, + LZ = Blow + Gn +4. (5.1)

Let us take the initial data

Vo(x) € HS(R)NL(R)

for system (1.5), and consider the unique local solution V(2,t) on the time in-
terval [0,7;] satisfying (2.6) and the estimate (2.7) because of Theorem 2.3. By
Proposition 3.6, the initial data Vo(x) corresponds to an initial data

Zo(x) € H*(R)OL'(R), (5.2)
with s > 3, for the Cauchy problem (5.1)-(5.2), with solution
Z (x,t) = DuW(O)(W(V(a,t)) — W(V)),

satisfying the same regularity and energy estimates as those of V; see Theorem 2.3.
Using the Duhamel’s formula we can express the variables Z(x,t) as

Z(a,t) = (e'? Zo) (a) + [ (e682) "Ge + ‘)) (x) dr,

with the definition of the semigroup e’® given by (4.9). Then, apply Corollary 4.4
to obtain

t
+f \jaf (e798 (A) Ge + a) (r)|lo dr.

Let us compute the last term on the right-hand side of (5.3). First, since the
identity

af (e!® (Ix f)) (0) = af" (el f) (a)
DISSIPATIVITY AND DECAY FOR A RADIATION HYDRODYNAMICS SYSTEM 25,

holds for f € H*(R) and ¢ such that 0 < ¢+1< s, we have

For the term involving q, we are going to use that q € M+, where M is the null

Next we estimate the Sobolev and L+ norms of g and g appearing on the right-
hand side of (5.4). For this purpose, let us remember that (see (4.4))
g = O(|W -W?),
G= O(|W — Wi Ine| + |W — WF).

Since we are assuming s > 3, we can use the Banach algebra properties of H*(R)
and the Sobolev calculus inequalities (see, e.g., Theorem 7.77 in [11] and Lemma
3.2 in [9]) to obtain

|W - WP lls < C|W -W||s|W -W|n~ < CW -W||s||W - Whi

and

26 C. LATTANZIO, R. G. PLAZA, AND J. M. VALDOVINOS

so that we have

om - (5.5)
la(7)|]s1 < C(W — W)(7) || — W)(7)II>-
In addition, it is easy to verify that

la(r)llea < C\|(W —W)(r)||t < CW —W)(r)Io 4.
Thus, using estimates (5.5) and (5.6) in estimate (5.4), we are lead to

Now, let us define

With this notation, from estimate (5.8) we obtain

pio(t) = sup (1+7)*/4 [ (+r—n) P40. 47)7/? dn.

As 1; (t) and j1(t) are uniformly bounded in t (see, for example, Lemma A.1 in [37]),
we can rewrite (5.9) as
IY —V)@II], $ € (Mo — Visa + M0 — Vilan) + Cl]V -V) |, 250

+el\v -V)@l-
(5.10)

Hence we have proved the following result.
DISSIPATIVITY AND DECAY FOR A RADIATION HYDRODYNAMICS SYSTEM 27

Proposition 5.1. Assume hypotheses (H,) — (H3). Let V(a,t) be the local solution
on the time interval [0,T] of the Cauchy problem for system (1.5) with initial data

Vo(x) satisfying Vo —V € (H8(R)N LR)", s > 3, and define
Vo — Vlaa = Vo — Vle + [Vo - Vl,
for0<k<s. Then there exist positive constants ai(< ao) (with ag as in Lemmata
2.6 and 2.7) and 6, = 6;(a1) such that if Ns(T) < ay and ||Vo —V||s-1,1 < 61, then
the estimate
I(V —V)@)I[s-1 < Ca + 7/4 1]M0 — VJs—a (5.11)
holds for all t € [0,T], with a positive constant C3 = C3(a1, 51).

As a consequence of the proposition above we obtain the a priori energy estimate
that we were missing.

Corollary 5.2. Under the same assumptions of Proposition 5.1, the estimate

Iv - 7). oita+ fo laeV (naar <CalVo-Vi2aa (6-12)

holds for all t € [0,T] and some positive constant C4 = C4(a1, 61).

Proof. We follow the same steps to get estimate (5.11). At the point where we
obtain estimate (5.4), we sum up from ¢ = 1 to = s — 1 to obtain the estimate

|.V(r)I|s—2 < Cx +t) 9/4 [Vo — Visa.
Then, by taking the square of this estimate and integrating on time we arrive at
t
[ laVOl22¢r < Cl -ViR aw
Jo
where C is a positive constant uniform in ¢t. Here we have used that the function

(1+t)~%/? is integrable in [0, 00). Finally, combining the last estimate and estimate
(5.11) we obtain the result.

5.2. Global decay rate of small perturbations and proof of Theorem 1.2.
Up to this point, we are almost ready to prove the main result of the paper: the
global existence and asymptotic decay of small perturbations of constant state
solutions to system (1.5). For this, we only need the appropriate a priori energy
estimate to perform the standard continuation argument of the local solution. This
estimate is a direct consequence of Lemmata 2.6 and 2.7 and Corollary 5.2, and it
is the content of the next result.

Corollary 5.3. Let V(x,t) be the local solution on [0,T] of the initial value problem
of system (1.5) with initial data Vo satisfying Vo —V € (H°(R)N D(R))*, $23,
with the regularity (2.6) from the local existence Theorem 2.3. Then there exist
positive constants aa(< a,) and Cs = Cs(a2,61), with ay and 6, as in Proposition
5.1, such that if N,(T) < ag and ||Vo — V 5-11 < 51, then the estimate

sup ||(V—V)(r)|I3 + [Wi (0,4, 4)(r)I[5-1 + lOem(7)II5 dr < Cs||Vo — VIE,

O<r<t
(5.13)
holds for allt € [0,T).
28 C. LATTANZIO, R. G. PLAZA, AND J. M. VALDOVINOS

Proof. Combine the estimates given by Lemmata 2.6 and 2.7 and that of Corollary
5.2 in the form (2.13) + a (2.14) + (5.12) for some a > 0 satisfying aC < 1. Thus
we are lead to

from which we get (5.13) by taking N,(T) small enough.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. Follows directly from the local existence Theorem 2.3, Propo-
sition 5.1, Corollary 5.3 and a standard continuation argument; for further details,
see the proof of Theorem 6.1 in [37] or that of Theorem 5.1 in [38].

6. DISCUSSION

In this paper we have studied a non-equilibrium diffusion limit system of equa-
tions, derived by Buet and Després [5], which describes the dynamics of a non-
relativistic, strongly radiative inviscid fluid. The system can be viewed as a sin-
gular limit in the non-equilibrium diffusion regime, that is, when the temperature
of radiation is a priori different from the fluid temperature. The radiation appears
through an extra equation of parabolic type for the radiative temperature. This
parabolic term, together with the relaxation term (which also comes from the equa-
tion for radiative energy), are the only dissipative mechanism within the system. In
previous works, damping, viscous or heat conduction effects for the fluid have been
incorporated into the equations in order to show global existence of perturbations
of (and stability of) constant states. Up to our knowledge, this is the first con-
tribution addressing this issue for the original (inviscid, non-heat-conducting and
without damping) set of equations proposed in [5]. We show the global existence
and decay in time of perturbations of constant equilibrium states for the system in
one space dimension.

Instead of working directly with the model equations and of performing ad hoc
energy estimates, we adopted an abstract methodology that involves the strict dissi-
pativity and the linear decay structure of the system, which can be extrapolated to
the nonlinear problem. This method falls under the framework of the classical work
by Kawashima and Shizuta [20,40] for systems of hyperbolic-parabolic type. For
this purpose, we proved that the entropy function identified by Buet and Després [5]
can be used to symmetrize the system and to recast the problem in terms of new
perturbation variables. The latter and the resulting system of equations play a cru-
cial role in the establishment of the linear decay of the associated semigroup, based
on the genuine coupling condition in one space dimension. In addition, we proved
that for dimensions d > 2 the system fails to be genuinely coupled; see Proposition
B.1 below. This fact justifies the application of the methods to the system in one
dimension only. The lack of dissipative terms such as material viscosities, the lack

DISSIPATIVITY AND DECAY FOR A RADIATION HYDRODYNAMICS SYSTEM 29
of damping terms, as well as the non-genuinely coupled nature of the system, make
the multi-dimensional model worthy of further investigations.

in any space dimension d > 1 in the

perturbation framework around a constant equilibrium state, provided that the
initial data is sufficiently smooth and close to the constant equilibrium state. This
local existence result follows directly from a previous theorem by Kawashima [16].
Here we verify that the generic radiation system (1.1) can be put into the non-
homogeneous quasilinear form needed in [16]. For this purpose, first we use the
continuity equation to simplify the momentum equation as follows:

p(Vu)u+ V 0.

Next, take the inner product of the resulting momentum equation with the velocity
field u to obtain

0, (4 |u|?) + pV(Slul?) -w+ Vp-u= -4Vn-u.

Let us recast the energy equations as
O(pE)+V > ((pE +p)u) = V-(g-Vn) — (in + V- (nu + fnu)).

The latter can be simplified, using the continuity equation, the equation for the
radiation intensity and the fact that E = e+ 3/ul?, into

paz (e + $\ul?) + pV(e4
Now subtract equation (A.1) from the last equation to obtain

local well-posedness. Thus we have the following theorem, which is a restatement
of Theorem 2.9 in [16].

for w € St!, and where F is given by (B.3). By the form of E and the relation
R= a, it is easy to check that

ker(Z) = span ({(1,01a; 0,0), (0,€),0,0),(0,0rxa, 1/(48"), 1) Ljs 1,...,a}),
while

ker(B(w)) = span ({(1, 01xa;0, 0), (0, €;,0,0), (0, 01a, 1,0) : 7 =1,...,d}),
which is independent of w. Thus we obtain

ker(Z) Nker(B(w)) = span ({(1,01xa,0,0), (0,é;,0,0) : 7 =1,...,d}).

Let us take  € ker(Z) Nker(B(w)), w = (0, ég,0,0) #0. Then for all directions
Ww = (w1,W9,...,Wa) € S¢ such that wy = 0, which always exist as we are assuming

(B.6) does not satisfy the genuine coupling condition when d > 2.

Remark B.2. Let us observe that the argument of the proof above does not apply
to one space dimension (d = 1) because in that case w = £1 and hence we cannot
choose w such that wq = 0.

APPENDIX C. SPECTRAL ANALYSIS OF THE SEMIGROUP FOR SMALL WAVE
NUMBERS

Next, we prove a result that was used along the proof of Lemma 4.5. The analysis
is basically the same as that presented in [22, Appendix A]. However, a small
modification must be made to take into account the dissipation due to viscosity
mechanisms. Let us start by defining U(z) := '(z)~1, where TP := (A°) 1? and
®(z) is defined after (4.9):

O(z) = —(A°)* (Z + 2A — 2B) :

Then we consider ¥(0) = T0(0)P-! = —-[-!ZP-!, which is real symmetric and
non-positive definite. Thus (0) has an spectral representation of the form

W(0) = S> AjIl;, (C.1)
j=l
34 C. LATTANZIO, R. G. PLAZA, AND J. M. VALDOVINOS

where the js are the distinct r eigenvalues of (0) and Is are the corresponding
eigenprojections. The IIs are real symmetric satisfying
r

Yih =s, TA, dl,

j=l
where 6;x is the Kronecker delta. In (C.1) we sort out the eigenvalues such that
Ay = 0 and \; < 0 for j = 2,...,r. Then II, R* is the null space of U(0), which
implies

IL,R*=TM, (C.2)

where M is the null space of L.

As U(z) is a polynomial family of matrices depending on the complex parameter
z €C, there is only a finite number of coalescing points in the complex plane; see
Texier [41, Proposition 1.3]. This implies that the coalescing points are isolated.
Thus for z close to 0, but different of 0, the eigenvalues of (z) are of constant
multiplicity, and we can write the spectral decomposition

U(z) = D> Ae(z) H(z), (C.3)
1

where 7 is constant. In the above representation the eigennilpotent part of each
eigenvalue is zero, as a consequence of Y(z) being real symmetric (and hence diag-
onizable) for z real and because of analytic continuation to z complex. Moreover,
one can easily show that Ag(z) and II¢(z) are analytic at z = 0 (see, e.g., Liu and
Zeng [33, Lemma 6.8]), and the IIp(z) are real symmetric for z real and they satisfy

> Ig(z) =I, Te(z)Ue(z) = 5TH e(z), (C.4)
f=1

for ¢,k =1,2,...,7. Evaluating (C.3) at z = 0 and using (C.1) we get

S> Ae(0)He(0) = S> AjHy.
e=1 j=l

Thus by the uniqueness of the spectral decomposition as the sum of a diagonalizable
operator and a nilpotent one, we obtain that for each j = 1,2,...,r, there exists
nj; of the 7 eigenvalues Ag(z) such that A; = A¢(0). We rename these n, eigenvalues
by Aja(z), with a = 1,2,...,n;, so that the spectral decomposition (C.3) can be
rewritten as

W(z) = S02 YO Aja(2)Hja(2), (C.5)
j=la=l
while (C.4) becomes
SOS Wel2) =1,  Wja(2)Ujrar (2) = 65515aa’Hjo(2)- (C.6)
j=la=l
In addition, there holds
Th; = $0 Wja(0), Ay = Ajo (0). (C.7)
