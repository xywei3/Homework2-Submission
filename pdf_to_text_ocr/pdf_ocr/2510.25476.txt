ABSTRACT

Context. The distribution of the coronal electron density at different distances from the Sun strongly influences the physical processes
in the solar corona and it is therefore a very important topic in solar physics. The majority of the methods, including radio observations,
used for estimation of coronal electron density were up to now not fully validated due to the absence of the in situ observations closer
to the Sun. Consequently, space weather forecasting models which simulate coronal density lacked proper validation. Newly available
Parker Solar Probe (PSP) in situ observations at distances close to the Sun, provide an opportunity to study the properties of plasma
near the Sun and to compare observational and modeling results.

Aims. The focus of this work is to study type III radio bursts, estimate their propagation path and validate coronal electron density
obtained from radio, in situ observations and modeling with EUHFORIA (EUropean Heliospheric FORecasting Information Asset).
Methods. In this study of type III radio bursts observed during the second PSP perihelion, we employ radio triangulation and modeling
to analyze coronal electron density. Using the radio triangulation method, we determine the 3D positions of the radio sources. Addi-
tionally, we utilize the state-of-the-art EUHFORIA model to estimate electron densities at various locations. The electron densities
derived from radio observations and EUHFORIA modeling are then inter-validated with in situ measurements from PSP.

Results. We studied 11 Type III radio bursts during the second PSP perihelion, with radio triangulation showing their propagation
path in the southward direction from the solar ecliptic plane. The obtained radio source sizes ranged from 0.5 to 40 deg (0.5 - 25 Ra),
showing no clear frequency dependence. This indicates that scattering of radio waves was not very significant for the studied events
and in this frequency range.

A comparison of electron densities derived from radio triangulation, PSP in situ data, and EUHFORIA modeling showed a large range
of obtained values. This result is influenced by the different propagation paths across different coronal structures, and model limita-
tions. Despite these variations, EUHFORIA successfully identified high-density regions along type III burst paths, demonstrating its
capability to capture large-scale density structures.

Conclusions. Our study emphasize that type III bursts do not always follow the Parker spiral but instead trace distinct magnetic field
lines which can be very differently oriented. The study shows rather constant radio source sizes and confirms that small-scale density
fluctuations in PSP data remain relatively low. These two characteristics indicate that scattering effects do not significantly change
observed radio source positions within the studied distances.

1. Introduction

During the solar eruptive events such as Coronal Mass Ejec-
tions (CMEs) and solar flares we observe the wide spectrum of
emission in different wavelengths including solar radio emission.
As radio emission can provide information about background
plasma processes and the eruptive phenomena, it is in the focus
of numerous multi-wavelength studies of flare/CME events (e.g.,
Pick 1998; Nindos et al. 2008; Magdalenié et al. 2014; Jebaraj
et al. 2020, 2023; Kumari et al. 2023). Consequently, the study
of radio emissions has a vital role in the field of solar physics for
many decades (see e.g. Wild & McCready 1950; Robinson &
Cairns 1994; Magdalenié et al. 2014; Zucca et al. 2018; Jebaraj
et al. 2020; Klein 2021).

Solar radio bursts can be studied using four main types of ob-
servations: dynamic spectra, radio images, direction-finding and
ionospheric scintillation data. Herein, we focus on the dynamic
spectra and direction-finding observations. Dynamic radio spec-
tra are frequency-time diagrams with color-coded intensity (see,
Kundu et al. 1961; Van Haarlem et al. 2013; Marqué et al. 2018;
Jebaraj et al. 2023). Radio observations can be obtained using
both ground-based radio telescopes and space-based receivers,
each with their own limitations, but also offering valuable and
complimentary insights into different types of bursts and their
properties. Spectroscopic observations alone do not provide suf-
ficient information to accurately determine the source location
of the radio emission. The ground based radio imaging observa-
tions provide us the radio source position in the 2D space, i.e.

in the plane of the sky. Even more exact position of the radio
sources can be obtained employing the direction-finding obser-
vations which provide information on the wave vectors indicat-
ing the direction of the radio emission in the three dimensional
(3D) space (Manning & Fainberg 1980; Reiner et al. 1998). Di-
rection finding (DF) measurements from at least two spacecraft
can then be used to triangulate the position of the source in 3D
space (Krupar et al. 2012, 2014a,b, 2015), putting the radio emis-
sion in context with the flare/CME related processes (see e.g.
Martinez Oliveros et al. 2012; Magdalenié et al. 2014; Jebaraj
et al. 2020).

Solar radio bursts are classified into five major groups (type
I, IL, IL, IV and V), based on their spectral morphology as ob-
served in the metric wavelength range (Wild & McCready 1950;
Wild 1950; Dulk 1970; Melrose 1980; Nelson & Melrose 1985).
This paper is centered on the study of type III solar radio bursts
and estimation of the coronal plasma density at the source posi-
tion of these radio bursts. Type III bursts are the most commonly
observed type of solar radio emission. They are the electromag-
netic signatures of near-relativistic electron beams (Uiypem ~ ¢/3,
Suzuki & Dulk 1985; Klassen et al. 2003) that propagate along
open or quasi-open magnetic field lines (Pick et al. 2006; Reid
2020). Type III radio bursts are observed at fundamental and/or
harmonic plasma frequency (f, & 2f,), which involves genera-
tion and coupling of the Langmuir waves (Ginzburg & Zhelezni-
akov 1958; Melrose 1980; Robinson & Cairns 1994; Voshchep-
ynets et al. 2015; Krasnoselskikh et al. 2025). As they propa-
gate from high-to low-density regions in the solar corona they
appear as a fast drifting lanes, from high to low frequency, in
the dynamic spectra. Type III bursts can be observed all the
way from GHz to kHz range (Benz et al. 1992; Meléndez et al.
1999; Leblanc et al. 1995, 1996; Dulk et al. 1998; Krupar et al.
2014a,b).

Since the type III radio bursts are generated at the f,, and/or
2 fp which is proportional to the electron density N_, radio bursts
can be used to estimate the coronal electron plasma densities
at their source region, employing the radio images and DF data
in metric and kilometric wavelength range, respectively (Mag-
dalenié et al. 2010; Zimovets et al. 2012; Magdalenié et al. 2014;
Jebaraj et al. 2020, 2023). However, up to now in situ observa-
tions which would allow validation of the results obtained from
radio observations were not available. The results derived from
radio observations were therefore not well constrained. As a re-
sults of these uncertainties rather old 1D coronal electron den-

sity models (e.g., Baumbach 1937; Newkirk 1961; Saito 1970;
Leblanc et al. 1998; VrSnak et al. 2004; Zucca et al. 2018) are
still most often employed.

Space weather forecasting models are a valuable tool for es-
timation of the coronal plasma characteristics, and in particu-
lar solar wind density and velocity. Such modeling results can
be directly compared with different types of observations which
allows, on one hand model validation and on the other hand it
can support the observational results. Two of most frequently
used state-of-the-art models of the background solar wind and
CME propagation in the heliosphere are EUHFORIA (European
Heliospheric Forecasting Information Asset; Pomoell & Poedts
2018) and Enlil (Odstréil et al. 1996; Odstrcil 2003; Odstréil
et al. 2005). In this work we will focus on the EUHFORIA
model. The modeling accuracy of the solar wind plasma char-
acteristics and arrival of high-speed streams and CMEs at Earth
is often not very accurate, with the average forecasting errors
as large as + 9 h (Hinterreiter et al. 2019; Samara et al. 2021;
Rodriguez et al. 2024).

The validation of the forecasting models is mostly done at
1 au where the in situ observations needed for model validation
are available (see e.g. Owens et al. 2008; MacNeice 2009; Jian
et al. 2011; Reiss et al. 2016, 2019; Hinterreiter et al. 2019; Ro-
driguez et al. 2024). Only several works were devoted to the val-
idation of the models at close to the Sun distances, (such as e.g.,
McGregor et al. 2011; Chen & Hu 2001; Leitner et al. 2007).
Recent in situ observations by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP; Fox
et al. 2016) allowed model validation at various distances from
the Sun (Riley et al. 2021; Wallace et al. 2022; Samara et al.
2024, Senthamizh Pavai et al., in prep.). The novel PSP in situ
data can also excellently serve for the validation of plasma pa-
rameters obtained from radio observations which also map the
ambient solar wind characteristics at various distances from the
Sun. We devote this study to the estimation and comparison
of the coronal plasma density obtained through three different
ways, modeling, in situ observations and radio observations.

Herein we present for the first time a comparison of coro-
nal plasma densities estimated using type III radio bursts, radio
triangulation method, in situ observations by PSP and modeling
with EUHFORIA. This approach allows us to address uncertain-
ties of both the radio triangulation technique and the EUHFO-
RIA modeling together. The paper is structured as follows: The
data used in this study is described in Section 2. We discuss the
method of radio triangulation and space weather model EUH-

method of obtaining electron densities. Section 5 presents the
analysis of the selected events. Section 6 discuss the triangula-
tion results, while Section 7 addresses the results related to com-
parison of densities obtained by different methods and it summa-
rizes the uncertainties induced by each method. The discussion
and conclusions are presented in Section 8.

2. Data description

In order to give the context on the coronal eruptive processes
associated with the studied radio bursts we employed multi-
wavelength analysis. Together with the radio observations we
employed white light, Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) and Soft X-
ray (SXR) observations. The main input for modeling with EUH-
FORIA were synoptic magnetograms, while in situ observations
were used for the validation of modeling results and comparison
with the coronal electron density obtained from radio observa-
tions.

EUV and SXR observations:

The low solar corona was analyzed using Extreme Ultraviolet
(EUV) observations from two instruments:

a) EUVI (Extreme Ultra Violet Imager; Howard et al. 2008)
on-board STEREO-A (Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory
Ahead; Kaiser et al. 2008) provided images in four channels:
171, 195, 284, and 304 A.

b) AIA (Atmospheric Imaging Assembly; Lemen et al. 2012)
onboard SDO (Solar Dynamics Observatory; Pesnell et al. 2012)
provided observations in 7 different channels: 94, 131, 171, 193,
211, 304, and 335 A.

We also employed soft X-ray ray (SXR) Observations ob-
tained from the GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmen-
tal Satellite; Garcia 1994) to identify the flaring activity possibly
associated with studied radio bursts.

White light observations:

In order to study dynamics of the higher corona, such as pos-
sibly associated CMEs, we used coronagraphic observations
from the STEREO-A and also LASCO (Large Angle Spectro-
metric COronagraph; Brueckner et al. 1995) on board SOHO
(Solar and Heliopsheric Observatory; Domingo et al. 1995).
SOHO/LASCO includes externally occulted coronagraphs C2
(1.5—6 Ro) and C3 (3.7 —30 Ro) while STEREO-A provides two
field of view, COR1 (1.5—4 Ro) and COR2 (up to 15 Ro).

Radio observations:

The main focus of this paper are type III radio bursts observed
by space-based radio instruments on board Wind (Bougeret et al.
1995), STEREO-A and PSP (Parker Solar Probe; Fox et al.
2016). We have used two different types of observations: dy-
namic radio spectra and DF data. Wind/Waves instruments pro-
vide dynamic radio spectra obtained from two receivers RADI
and RAD2 covering the frequency ranges of 20—1040kHz
and 1075 — 13825 kHz, respectively. DF measurements are avail-
able in discrete frequencies between 100-1040 kHz with tem-
poral resolution of 45 s. This study uses the publicly re-
leased Wind/WAVES RAD1 direction-finding dataset, Version
O1 (released 2022; Bonnin et al. 2022). Dynamic spectra by
two receivers LFR and HFR (Low & High Frequency Re-

ceiver) onboard STEREO/Waves cover together the frequency
range of 40— 16000 kHz. Similarly, DF measurements made by
STEREO/Waves are available in a somewhat smaller frequency
range of 125-1975 kHz and with larger time resolution (30 s) at
number of discrete frequencies (Krupar et al. 2022).

The Radio Frequency Spectrometer (RFS; Pulupa et al. 2017)
part of the FIELDS (Bale et al. 2016) instrument suite on-
board PSP provided spectroscopic observations in the range of
10.5 — 19000.2 kHz by combining both the High/Low Frequency
Receivers (HFR/LFR). The full averaged spectra is obtained at a
7s cadence during PSP’s close encounters.

Magnetogram:

We used the synoptic magnetogram maps provided by
NSO/GONG (National Solar Observatory’s Global Oscillation
Network Group; Harvey et al. 1996) and ADAPT (Air Force
Data Assimilative Photospheric Flux Transport; Hickmann et al.
2015) maps as a main data input to the EUHFORIA model.
These two type of magnetic maps will be further referred as
GONG and ADAPT respectively.

In situ data:

The quasi-thermal noise (QTN) spectroscopy allows us to obtain
the electron density through an accurate electrodynamic proxy
by making use of the measurement of the plasma frequency by
LFR/RFS (Moncuquet et al. 2020). The RFS receiver has the
optimal conditions for accurate measurement during the perihe-
lion passages (Pulupa et al. 2017) which makes “PSP density”
values used in this work quite reliable. PSP also has another in-
strument onboard which measures the plasma density, SWEAP
(Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons; Kasper et al. 2016).
SWEAP’s Faraday cups and electrostatic analyzers may under-
estimate electron density due to inability to fully capture strahl
and halo electrons, especially in regions with low angular cov-
erage; and the use of assumptions on the distribution function
shape (often Maxwellian), which may not hold in turbulent or
anisotropic conditions. In contrast, QTN spectroscopy uses ther-
mal noise spectra, which are directly proportional to the electron
plasma frequency, and thus offer absolute density estimates, es-
pecially in regimes where the plasma is not fully sampled by
SWEAP. As this is also supported by number of studies (e.g.,
Meyer-Vernet 2001; Moncuquet et al. 2020; Liu, M. et al. 2021;
Martinovi¢ et al. 2022) we choose to employ the data from
FIELDS instrument which is dedicated for the study of electrons,
the prime focus of this paper.

3. Methodology
3.1. Radio triangulation

Mapping radio source positions in interplanetary space can be
done employing different methods (see e.g., Reiner et al. 2009;
Alcock 2018; Zhang et al. 2019; Musset et al. 2021; Badman
et al. 2022; Cafiizares et al. 2024). The majority of these methods
while estimating the position of the radio sources and the direc-
tion of the propagation of the radio emission consider some ap-
proximations and simplifications which reduce the 3D methods
to the 2D space. TDOA (time-difference-of-arrival) method by
Badman et al. (2022) assumes the location of the radio sources
in the ecliptic plane along with the observing spacecraft. Quite
similar to TDOA is BELLA (BayEsian LocaLisation Algorithm)
method (Cafiizares et al. 2024) which is also reduced to the 2D

space. The methods by Reiner et al. (2009) and Musset et al.
(2021) bring rather large uncertainty in the source position esti-
mation assuming the coronal electron density in order to obtain
the radial distance of the sources from the Sun. Another method
which makes assumption on the coronal electron density model
is SEMP (Solar radio burst Electron Motion Tracker) by Zhang
et al. (2019). This method also assumes the propagation of the
radio sources along the Parker spiral with the constant speed. We
note that accurately obtaining not only the propagation direction
but also the 3D radio source positions is possible exclusively em-
ploying, so called, radio triangulation method (e.g., Reiner et al.
1998; Krupar et al. 2014a,b; Magdaleni¢ et al. 2014; Jebaraj et al.
2020). We consider this method for obtaining source position in
3D space, as it is the most reliable one since it does not include
additional assumptions like most of the other methods.

In this study, we will further use 3D radio source positions to
map the coronal electron density along the type III radio bursts
propagation path.

In order to employ radio triangulation and estimate the ra-
dio source positions in the 3D space we need goniopolarimetric
(GP) or direction-finding observations from at least two or more
widely positioned spacecraft. Using the DF methods on the GP
observations, i.e., the flux, azimuth and colatitude, we can esti-
mate the direction of arrival of an incident electromagnetic wave.
Due to differences between STEREO and Wind spacecraft dif-
ferent methods need to be applied to the DF observations in order
to obtain the information about the wave vectors. The spinning
demodulation method (Gurnett et al. 1978; Manning & Fainberg
1980) was then used for the Wind data and singular value de-
composition (SVD) (Cecconi & Zarka 2005; Cecconi et al. 2008;
Krupar et al. 2012) for the STEREO data to obtain the wave vec-
tors from the two different view points. Although the GP obser-
vations start around 1975 kHz, in this study we considered Wind
& STEREO-A frequency pairs at 425/428, 525/548, 575/548,
625/624, 675/624, 725/708, 775/708 kHz, respectively.

The frequency range of roughly 400-800 kHz was selected
in order to assure that the fundamental emission is a dominant
radio emission component with also often smaller and better de-
fined source sizes as discussed by Dulk et al. (1984); Melrose
(1980). The novel PSP data provide more observational evidence
on the fundamental and harmonic of the type III radio bursts ap-
pearance. Jebaraj et al. (2023) shows that large fraction of type
Ill bursts seen by PSP consists of fundamental and harmonic
component. However, due to the proximity of the local plasma
frequency, the type III bursts below 1 MHz are not clearly dis-
tinguishable in the dynamic spectrum (see e.g. Fig. 1 in Jebaraj
et al. 2023). On the other hand, type III bursts examples in the
study by Chen et al. (2024) show rather clear dominance of the
fundamental emission band below 1 MHz. Therefore, consider-
ing that majority of the type III burst below conservative value
of 800 kHz, even smaller than before mentioned 1 MHz, is a rea-
sonable assumption. This criteria is therefore also favorable for
obtaining the electron density in the 3D space using radio source
positions as accurate as possible. Once we obtained the wave
vectors for the selected frequency pairs, we consider that the ra-
dio source position is within the shortest distance between these
two wave vectors. We note that the radio source size could be
actually smaller than the distance between these two wave vec-
tors. Similarly to the previous studies (Magdalenié¢ et al. 2014;
Jebaraj et al. 2020) the radio emission apparent source region is
then defined as a sphere sketched in the (Fig. 1). We estimate this
apparent source size in degrees as, the angle 6 projected on the
solar surface by the shortest distance between the wave vectors
d, expressed as,

Article number, page 4 of 20

6 = 2tan (4) dd)

Where, D is the distance from the Sun to the radio source
position. We note that the spherical source shape approximation,
used here also to estimate the source size and volume (Fig. 9b
and 12) is commonly used in the literature as a first-order ap-
proximation for the radio source shape (Reiner et al. 1998; Saint-
Hilaire et al. 2012; Magdalenié et al. 2014; Jebaraj et al. 2020).
This source shape approximation implies also the homogeneous
intensity over the source region.

Fig. 1. Schematic illustration of the radio source size, calculated in de-
grees from the shortest distance between the wave vectors Wy ing and
Wsra. The distance d is derived from the Wind and STEREO-A DF ob-
servations. The sizes of the Sun, radio source and the distance between
them are not in the real proportions.

3.2. EUHFORIA

One of the recently developed and dynamically evolving model
of the solar wind and CMEs is a 3D magntohydrodynamic
(MHD) model EUHFORIA (Pomoell & Poedts 2018). This data-
driven forecasting model computes the time evolution of the in-
ner heliospheric plasma. The ideal MHD equations are used to
build the model that self-consistently simulates the solar coronal
plasma. The main input to the model are synoptic magnetograms
and the output is in the form of time series and 3D simulation
results. EUHFORIA consists of two different domains: coronal
and inner heliospheric domain, and a CME insertion part.

The coronal model in EUHFORIA provides the boundary
conditions at 0.1 au, so called inner boundary of EUHFORIA,
necessary for modeling in the inner heliospheric domain. EU-
HFORIA’s coronal model is based on the potential-field source-
surface extrapolation model (PFSS; Altschuler & Newkirk 1969;
Schatten et al. 1969) followed by the Schatten Current Sheet
model (SCS; Schatten 1971) and Wang-Sheeley-Arge model
(WSA; Wang & Sheeley 1990; Arge & Pizzo 2000). The heloi-
spheric model reconstructs the evolution and propagation of the
coronal plasma covering the distances from 0.1 to 2 au. Differ-
ent CME models can be introduced in the heliospheric domain
of EUHFORIA to study the CMEs propagation and forecast their
arrival at Earth (Maharana et al. 2022; Niemela et al. 2023; Ro-
driguez et al. 2024; Valentino & Magdalenié 2024).

While first accuracy testing of the solar wind modeling was
done at | au (e.g. Hinterreiter et al. 2019; Asvestari et al. 2019,
2020), recently available PSP in situ observations opened the
possibilities for model validation at various distances close to
the Sun (Samara et al. 2024). Validating and improving the so-
lar wind modeling is important since it strongly affects also the

4. Type Ill bursts and coronal electron density

During PSP’s second close encounter, when the probe reached
distances of up to ~0.16 au from the solar surface, it observed
several groups of type III radio bursts. These bursts were also de-
tected by STEREO-A and Wind at ~1 au. We inspected the entire
three week period of the perihelion (25 March — 14 April, 2019)
in order to isolate type III radio bursts suitable for our study.
This period is ideal given the near-quadrature alignment between
Wind and STEREO-A spacecraft, 97° (Fig. 2), which is best
suited for the radio triangulation method (Reiner et al. 2009;
Magdaleni€¢ et al. 2014).

4.1. Event selection criteria

We selected 11 type III radio bursts (Table 1) based on the fol-
lowing criteria:

1. Radio bursts need to be observed by both Wind and
STEREO-A to obtain dynamic spectra (see Fig. 3) and

direction-finding observations.

2. Type II radio burst should be well distinguishable from other
types of radio emission. We aim to have type III bursts as iso-
lated as possible, in order to have a clear and not visibly over-
lapping frequency time profiles (see Fig. 4). We excluded
type III bursts appearing in the big groups of numerous over-
lapping bursts.

3. Selected burst need to be of significantly higher flux inten-
sity, approximately two orders of magnitude above the back-
ground level, in order to secure good triangulation results.

We note that most of the type III bursts occur within few min-
utes sometimes resulting in not completely simple time profiles

(Fig. 4). This complexity in the time profiles can lead to poten-
tially erroneous estimation of the radio source positions (Desh-
pande & Magdalenié¢ in prep.).

The EUV observations showed that all selected type III ra-
dio bursts were associated with the active region (AR) NOAA
12738 (Fig. 5 and 6). The source region was located at about 17°
behind the east solar limb as seen from Earth on the day of the
last observed type III bursts (05 April 2019). The AR was rather
simple with a/8 photospheric magnetic field configuration de-
fined once it rotated on the visible side of the Sun. For all of
the studied type III bursts, EUV observations were only avail-
able from STEREO-A. Observations at all of the 4 wavelength
channels (see Sect 3) provided by STEREO-A showed that the
selected type III bursts were associated with small jet and jet-like
structures (see example in Fig. 5).

The coronagraph observations showed few very faint and
narrow CMEs during the considered time interval. The CMEs
were mostly propagating along the streamer regions seen above
the East solar limb (see Fig. 6). Propagation of the CMEs might
have changed the magnetic field configuration of the ambient so-
lar corona and influenced the propagation of the type III electron
beams (Magdaleni¢ et al. in prep.). We also note that the white
light observations show the existence of a streamer that seem
to originate close the NOAA AR 12738 (Fig. 6). The visual in-
spection of the EUV observations show streamer which initially
appears bright when the AR is near the east limb (see Fig. 6,
panels a and d). As the AR approaches the central meridian, the
streamer becomes faint and almost not visible due to projection
effect (Fig. 6, panels b and e). The streamer becomes bright again
as the AR moves toward the west solar limb (Fig. 6, panels c and

f).

4.2. Different methods of estimating coronal electron density
4.2.1. Radio density

The plasma frequency is due to collective oscillations of free
electrons in the plasma. It is determined by the electron density
(n), the elementary charge (e), and the electron mass (m,). Math-
ematically, it can be expressed as,

ne

tp = (2)

T &

re

Electron density generally decreases with the increasing distance
from the Sun, this makes the simultaneous decrease of the local
plasma frequency. Such a behavior allows us to estimate the den-
sities corresponding to each plasma frequency associated with
the radio emission at the specific distances from the Sun. The
radio triangulation method can be used to obtain the heights in
the corona to which the estimated density corresponds. We will
call density obtained in the described way “radio density”.

4.2.2. EUHFORIA density

EUHFORIA simulates density, velocity, and magnetic field in
the 3D space, all the way from the Sun to Earth and up to 2 au.
In the framework of a single-fluid ideal- MHD model like EUH-
FORIA, the plasma is treated as quasi-neutral "fluid" with equal
contribution of the electrons and protons which are not differen-
tiated. Under this assumption, dividing the fluid number density
by two gives a rough estimate of the electron (or ion) number
density.

As the main input to EUHFORIA we used the synoptic
GONG and ADAPT magnetograms (see Sect 3). The source sur-
face radii (SSR) of the PFSS, which defines height from which
all the magnetic field lines are considered as open is combined

Article number, page 6 of 20

with the source surface heights (SSH) of SCS model. In the de-
fault set up of EUHFORIA the SSH and SSR are considered to
be 2.3 and 2.6 Ro respectively. For modeling with GONG mag-
netograms we also used different pairs of the SSR values, in or-
der to increase the accuracy of the background solar wind model-
ing. The solar wind speed and number density is described in the
same way as in Pomoell & Poedts 2018 (eq. 2 & 4). In this study
we used the intermediate resolution of EUHFORIA defined with
angular resolution of 2° with 512 grid cells in radial direction
from 0.1 au to 2 au. We note that EUHFORIA allows also low
(4° angular resolution with 256 grid cells) and high resolutions
(1° angular resolution with 1024 grid cells).

With EUHFORIA we obtain simulation results in the 3D
space which gives us the possibility to estimate the EUHFO-
RIA electron density at any specific position. For that purpose
we insert so-called virtual spacecrafts in the modeling domain
(see Fig.1 in Scolini et al. 2023; Valentino & Magdalenié 2024).
Using virtual spacecraft allowed us to obtain EUHFORIA time
series both at the radio source positions and along the PSP prop-
agation trajectory.

5. Case study of Event 8 and 9

The case study of two type III radio bursts recorded on
05 April 2019 aims to demonstrate different methods for ob-
taining the solar wind densities and the ways to compare es-
timated values. The two selected type II bursts have peak in-
tensities at 17:06 UT and 17:17 UT as detected by Wind, and
around 17:05 UT and 17:16 UT as observed by STEREO-A.
The peak times as observed by PSP are listed in Table 1. Simi-
larly to all other type IIIs these two Events were sourced in the
NOAA AR 12738 and associated with jets. Due to the insuf-
ficient time resolution of the EUV data, it was challenging to

radio emission at the DF frequency at 725 KHz, as observed
by STEREO-A, is 8.29 x 107!7 W/m2?/Hz, which is about 100
times larger than at a similar frequency in Wind observations
(1 x 10-'? W/m?/Hz at 708 KHz). The intensity of the radio
emission at the closest PSP frequency of 721 KHz for the same
burst was 3.92 x 10-!4 W/m?/Hz (Fig. 3). A large difference be-
tween the STEREO-A and Wind type III intensity indicates that
the burst likely propagates more towards STEREO-A (Fig. 2)
than towards Wind spacecraft. However, as PSP is at 0.16 au and
STEREO-A and Wind are at about | au, direct comparison of
the radio burst intensity and its directivity using all three view-
ing points is somewhat ambiguous.

The frequency-time profiles of studied bursts, as observed
by both STEREO-A and Wind data, are rather symmetric with
a single maximum. This symmetry of both bursts is better seen
in STEREO-A observations. We note that due to lower temporal
resolution of the Wind data, the profile of Event 9 is likely not
fully resolved (Fig. 4) while the time profile of Event 8 is affected
by the data gap (Fig. 3).

We note that it is difficult to state with full certainty whether
the analyzed type III time profiles represent only single isolated
bursts. Recent results by Gerekos et al. (2024, see Fig. 6), based
on high temporal (1.43 ms) and frequency (7.41 KHz) resolution
observations, suggest that more than one fully resolved type III
profiles could be expected in the WIND and STEREO-A obser-
vations. The rather symmetric time profiles indicate that poten-

Article number, page 8 of 20

tially unresolved type III bursts are temporally very close to each
other.

Additionally, the dynamic spectra (Fig. 3) reveal faint blob-
like structures at the low-frequency part of both bursts (between
0.2 and 0.3 MHz), clearly observed by STEREO-A and PSP. No
fine structures of the similar shape can be observed in the high
frequency part of the bursts indicating that the blob-like struc-
ture are possibly different than the stria substructures previously
reported (e.g., Jebaraj et al. 2023). It is possible that the blob-
like structures are observed in the STEREO-A and PSP data be-
cause the radio burst propagates towards STEREO-A, and close
to the PSP. The reasons for not seeing the blob-like structure in
the Wind data are possibly the radio burst propagation path away
from Wind spacecraft and/or the instrumental effect. These struc-
tures observed in the dynamic spectra suggest that the measured
time profiles at direction-finding frequencies are not simple but
rather a convolution of at least two distinct components. All
these characteristics of the two presented events indicate that the
type III bursts likely consist of either: (a) both fundamental and
harmonic components (Jebaraj et al. 2023), or (b) at least two
closely spaced type III bursts (e.g., Jebaraj et al. 2023; Gerekos
et al. 2024). We note that both of mentioned studies which were
able to resolve the bursts time profiles considered type III bursts
at frequencies higher than in this study namely above 1 MHz (see
Fig. | in Jebaraj et al. 2023) and 13.5 MHz (Gerekos et al. 2024).

temporal resolution as in the study by Vecchio et al. (2024) who
considered type IIIs observed at frequencies above ~ 3 MHz, at
frequencies below 1 MHz it is likely that time profiles will be
convolutions of fundamental and harmonic emission or subse-
quent bursts (see Fig. 9 in Dulk et al. 1984). Therefore, increas-
ing temporal resolution further will often not allow clear decon-
volution of the overlapping components, in particular below the
herein considered frequencies below 800 kHz.

6. Triangulation results

In this section we discuss triangulation results for the Events 8
and 9 (see Fig. 7), and position these results in context with the
statistics of the whole data set.

Using radio triangulation with Wind & STEREO-A data
we obtained the source positions of the type III bursts for the
seven selected frequency pairs (see Sect. 3.1). The obtained ra-
dio source positions, shown in Fig. 7, are at heights range 15 to
60 Ro. The spheres marking the radio sources in Fig. 7 have a
fixed size of 0.02 au for all frequency pairs, regardless of the ac-
tual distance between wave vectors determined by the direction-
finding method. This approach is chosen to improve the clarity
of the radio sources’ propagation direction, similar to the method
used by Magdalenié et al. (2014). Varying sphere sizes at dif-
ferent frequency pairs (as shown in Fig. 9) can visually distort
the apparent propagation path of the bursts. Figure 7a demon-
strates that the radio sources of Event 8 are well-aligned, clearly
showing a propagation path directed southward from the eclip-
tic plane. In contrast, the radio source positions for Event 9 are
less coherent, revealing a propagation path nearly parallel to the
ecliptic plane (Fig. 7b). This indicates that two consecutive type
Ill bursts, separated by only about 10 minutes, can have signif-
icantly different propagation directions and originate from fast
electron beams traveling along distinct, although not necessarily
widely separated, magnetic field lines.

We also plotted all type LI radio bursts together to visu-
alize their propagation paths relative to each other (Fig. 8a).
Most type LI bursts propagate southward from the solar eclip-
tic plane, possibly due to changes in magnetic field configura-
tion caused by the CMEs and streamers observed in white-light
data (Section 3). We note that even small changes in the re-
connection site (source of the type LI electron beams) or the
underlying magnetic field configuration can result in electrons
accessing different magnetic flux tubes, leading to slightly dif-
ferent propagation paths and possibly somewhat different appar-
ent radio source locations. Figure 8b shows all type III bursts,
with radio sources color-coded by frequency. Higher-frequency
sources (red spheres) are generally located closer to the Sun,
while lower-frequency sources (blue spheres) appear farther
away. This figure also highlights the spread of type III events as
the AR rotates. For example shown in Fig. 7 two type III bursts
are separated by less than 15 minutes and during this interval the
Sun rotates about 0.13 deg. Taking this into account, even if the
propagation path of the type II bursts would be exactly along
the same magnetic field line the impact on the estimated radio
source propagation would be small. The time difference between
the first and the last type III bursts is about 4 days which accounts
for about 52 deg in the change of the AR position. The spread
of the apparent source positions shown in the Fig. 8b is about
40-50 degrees which is in accordance with the AR rotation.

The distances between wave vectors (d), obtained through
radio triangulation, and the estimated radio source sizes (0) (Sec-
tion 4.1) are shown in Fig. 9 as functions of the STEREO-A
observing frequency (the first frequency in each triangulation

Article number, page 10 of 20

pair).According to eq. 1, radio source size depends on the dis-
tance between wave vectors and the source-to-Sun distance, re-
sulting in variations in data point distributions between the two
panels in Fig. 9. Red symbols represent results for Events 8 and
9, while black symbols indicate all other studied events. The ra-
dio source position falls within the distances between wave vec-
tors. We therefore consider that distance between the wave vec-
tors represents the upper limits for source sizes determined by
the triangulation method.

Figure 9 shows significant spreads in values of both d and
6 at each frequency. Although most data points cluster at lower
values, some large values for d and @ were observed, making a
simple mean inappropriate. To address this, we applied a boot-
strap method (Dissauer et al. 2018) to estimate the mean source
sizes and their uncertainties more accurately. Bootstrapping in-
volves repeatedly resampling the data (with replacement) to es-
timate statistical distributions without assuming underlying data
distributions. We performed 10,000 bootstrap resamples, com-
puting means and standard deviations for each set. This method
provides robust estimates of uncertainties, reflecting the data’s
inherent variability. Error bars derived from bootstrapping are
shown in Fig. 9.

The bootstrap-derived mean values of d and @ show only a
slight increase in the distance between wave vectors at frequen-
cies from 800 to 550 kHz, with small effect on source sizes.
Mean values for the next lower frequency range (550 to 400 kHz)
are unexpectedly smaller. We note that not all type II bursts go
to such low frequencies and often even if they do, the intensity
of the radio emission is very low which does not allow us to per-
form accurate radio triangulation. Therefore, we have less data
points below 550 kHz which could influence the obtained source
sizes. Considering the full frequency range (800-400 kHz), we
find no clear systematic variations in source sizes i.e., system-
atic increase in d or @ at lower frequencies was not found con-
trary to recent results in metric-range (Saint-Hilaire et al. 2012;
Gordovskyy et al. 2022). This indicates that the scattering effects
are probably stronger in the low corona than at larger distances
from the Sun. It is important to note that this lack of the system-
atic source size variation with the frequency is not influenced
with the source size definition. Namely, we employ the same
source size definition as in previous case studies (Magdaleni¢é
et al. 2014; Jebaraj et al. 2020) which found somewhat more sys-
tematic variation with the frequency decrease. The larger number
of considered type III bursts in this study provides more general
conclusion.

7. Comparison of the electron densities obtained
with different methods

7.1. Radio densities

After obtaining the 3D positions at which the radio emission was
generated in the corona, using eq. 2 and knowing the frequencies
at which radio burst was studied, we estimated the radio densi-
ties. Employing different frequency pairs (see Section 3.1) al-
lowed us to map the radio densities along the propagation path
of the type III electron beams in the 3D space (Fig. 7). Addition-
ally, in order to directly compare radio densities with the gener-
ally used 1D coronal electron density models we converted the
3D information of the radio source position to 1D heights (see
Section 4.2). Results of this part of the study are presented in
Fig. 10a which shows the density profiles as a function of height
above the solar surface. The radio density obtained for Events
8 and 9 is marked with red circles, and for all other studied

We find the radio densities obtained in this study to be situated
systematically above the 10xLeblanc or 3.5xSaito model and
along 20xLeblanc model (Leblanc et al. 1995). The obtained
radio density values are somewhat larger than the usually esti-
mated ones. However, the trend of the density change with the
height closely follows the one of Leblanc model, which is to
be expected as the Leblanc model was constructed based on the
type III radio bursts. Further, radio densities are also significantly
higher than the density observed by PSP during its first ten close
encounters, and reported in the statistical study by Kruparova
et al. (2023), shown in the Fig. 10 with the blue lines. We note
that the red points which represent results for the case study fol-

low the same trend as the rest of the obtained radio densities, and
they are situated just above the 10xLeblanc density profile.

We note that studies employing very large densities to ex-
plain radio observations were also reported earlier, in both met-
ric and kilometric range and amounted to as much as 10x Saito,
8x Newkirk etc. (see e.g Pohjolainen et al. 2008; Jebaraj et al.
2020).

7.2. EUHFORIA and PSP densities

In this section we discuss how “EUHFORIA densities” were ob-
tained from EUHFORIA simulations (Pomoell & Poedts 2018)
and its comparison with the radio densities (Section 7.1).

We employed the default set up of EUHFORIA code (Sec-
tion 3) to obtain EUHFORIA densities that can be com-
pared with the radio densities. As the main input to EUHFO-
RIA, we used GONG and ADAPT synoptic magnetograms at
03:00:00 UT on 05 April 2019. Since there were no CMEs di-
rectly temporally associated with the studied type III bursts, we
use only the background solar wind model, without inserting
CMEs.

Combining observations and the results of the radio triangu-
lation study shows that the type III radio bursts propagate in the
vicinity of PSP but do not exactly cross PSP path. That makes the
direct comparison of the radio density and the PSP density diffi-
cult. Therefore, we make a two-step comparison, which includes
EUHFORIA density and PSP density in the first step, and EU-
HFORIA density and radio density in the second step. However,
to understand how accurate the solar wind density modeled with
EUHFORIA is, we start with a comparison of the EUHFORIA
modeling results with the PSP densities.

Therefore, in order to compare radio density, as direct as pos-
sible, we used the 3D radio source positions obtained with radio
triangulation as the artificial spacecrafts in the EUHFORIA’s he-
liospheric domain (see sketch in Fig. 2b and also see Fig.1 in
Valentino & Magdaleni¢ 2024). That allowed us direct compar-
ison of the EUHFORIA density and radio densities along the
propagation path of type III electron beams.

Similarly to the method for comparison of modeling results
and radio densities we placed virtual spacecraft at PSP positions.
That allowed us to examine the time series observed by PSP and
the one modeled by EUHFORIA at PSP position (Fig. 7).

We initially utilized GONG magnetic maps to estimate inner
boundary conditions for EUHFORIA (Fig. 11, panel (a)). How-
ever, we observed that the estimated density at PSP position was
significantly underestimated when using the default PFSS height
of 2.6 Ro. In order to test if the change of the SSR can improve
the modeling accuracy (as shown by, Réville et al. 2015; Asves-
tari et al. 2019; Boe et al. 2020), additionally to the default set up
where SSR=2.6 Ro we also perform simulations for 4 different
SSRs (2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.0 Ro). Our results, presented in Fig. 11,
show the significant discrepancy between modeled and observed
electron density at the beginning of the considered time interval
when the PSP density is rather high, i.e., 00 UT on 02 April un-
til the 12 UT on the 03 April. Starting from around 10 UT on
03 April the PSP density sharply decreases and then remains at
that low value until the end of the considered interval. This low
level of the PSP density was better reproduced by EUHFORIA
than the density at the beginning of the considered period. Dur-
ing the interval of low PSP density its variability is between 100
to 200 particles/em? which is somewhat higher than the variabil-
ity we obtain with the modeling results (about 80 particles/em*)
using SSR between 2.6 to 2.9 Ro (Fig. 11). The modeling results
with SSR = 3.0 Ro show significant density increase, going to
the values of up to 200 particles/em?, matching the PSP density.
We need to note that in general, being the MHD model EUH-
FORIA is not able to reproduce the fast density-fluctuations like
e.g. the sudden density increase observed by PSP at the end of
the day on 06 April.

Since the modeling results obtained with the GONG magne-
tograms systematically underestimate the in situ density values,
in order to try to improve the modeling accuracy we employed
also ADAPT magnetograms. We run simulations using all 12 re-
alizations of ADAPT magnetograms and the default PFSS height
of 2.6 Ro. These simulations produced higher densities at PSP
position during the first time interval 00 UT on 02 April until
the 12 UT on the 03 April, aligning more accurately with PSP in

situ data, as seen in Fig. 11b. However, in the second part of the
considered time window 12 UT on 03 April until 08 April EU-
HFORIA with the ADAPT magnetograms input generates the
overestimated density. The results from all ADAPT realizations
differ from each other, yet all of them show a similar maximum
density values of approximately 500 particles/em>. We note that
the level of the variability between results obtained using differ-
ent ADAPT realizations is larger during the intervals of the high
density mapped by PSP (first mentioned interval). The ADAPT
maps provide more intervals of better reconstructed in situ den-
sity, in comparison to GONG maps which result in the system-
atic density underestimation. Therefore, we consider the model-
ing with the ADAPT maps to be more accurate one and will use
the best ADAPT realization 03 for modeling radio densities. We
would also like to note that modeling coronal plasma characteris-
tics at close to the Sun distances is quite difficult as the modeling
accuracy depends on the various different factors (Samara et al.
2024).

GONG and ADAPT magnetograms are differently con-
structed. GONG magnetograms are purely observational, lim-
ited to the visible disk of the Sun as seen from Earth. In contrast,
ADAPT magnetic maps are generated using a data assimilation
model that combines high-resolution observational data (taken
by SDO) with flux transport models to provide a time-evolving,
full-surface representation of the Sun’s magnetic field, including
regions not directly observed. This complex approach provides
possibility for more accurate and globally consistent solar mag-
netic environment when ADAPT maps are input to EUHFORIA.
Similarly to Perri et al. (2023), we obtained somewhat improved
prediction of solar wind dynamics and heliospheric conditions
when ADAPT maps were used. However, in order to confirm
that ADAPT maps give systemically better modeling results a
statistical study is necessary.

Panels c) to h) of Fig. 11 show comparison of: (a) the electron
lensity obtained with the radio observations (colorful points);
(b) the PSP density; and (c) the EUHFORIA density at the radio
source positions obtained using ADAPT maps as an input (col-
orful lines). The simulation results for the radio source positions
obtained with the first frequency pair 775-708 KHz is quite sim-
ilar to PSP electron density. As we go to the lower frequencies
(the increasing heights of the radio sources), the EUHFORIA
lensity at the radio source positions is systematically decreasing.
Such a behavior is expected as the solar wind density generally
lecreases with the increasing distance from the Sun. We note
that for the last frequency pair the difference becomes almost an
order of magnitude. The EUHFORIA results obtained using AD-
PAT maps at PSP position are along the Kruparova et al. (2023)
model, which represents PSP densities. Similar discrepancy be-
tween differently obtained density is also seen in the Fig. 10b
where the EUHFORIA results obtained at PSP and radio source
positions (blue and brown stars) are compared with the different
1D density models and radio densities. There are number of fac-
tors that induce the discrepancy of the coronal electron density
seen in 10b & Fig. 11 and they will be discussed in details in
Section 7.4.

In order to check how the angular and radial resolution in-
fluence the accuracy of the obtained simulation results in com-
parison to the radio source sizes (see Section 4.2) we estimated
the EUHFORIA cell volume at different distances from the Sun.
The estimation of the radio sources volume was done assum-
ing sources are of a spherical shape, with the distance between
the wave vectors considered as a sphere diameter. We obtained
the error bars and mean value for the radio source volume from
the bootstrapping method (Fig. 9a). In Fig. 12 we plot the ob-

Fig. 11. The comparison of PSP/FIELDS in situ electron density (black line) with EUHFORIA simulation results at various positions in the
heliosphere. Panel (a) displays simulations at PSP position using GONG magnetograms, with different colored lines representing simulations
performed with varying SSRs. The simulation using SSR = 3 Ro shows the best agreement with the in situ data. Panel (b) shows simulations
using default PFSS height at PSP position using all realizations of ADAPT magnetic maps, which in this case provide a better match than those

using GONG magnetograms. Panels (c) to (h) present EUHFORIA time

series obtained using ADPAT maps at radio source positions for different

triangulation frequency pairs, with colored points indicating the electron density at the respective radio frequencies (radio density). Radio densities

are notably higher than the in situ density, while the EUHFORIA results

tained radio source volume as a function of the distance from
the Sun estimated from the radio triangulation. The EUHFORIA
cell volume is calculated as follows,

dV =r’. sin(@). Ar.A0.AG (3)
where, r is radial distance between the inner boundary of EUH-
FORIA and the considered cell, Ar, A@, Ad are the radial, lati-
tudinal and longitudinal resolution of the EUHFORIA. Fig. 12
shows the comparison between EUHFORIA volume, in blue,
yellow and red depending on the EUHFORIA’s resolution, and
radio source volumes (black circles). Although, the EUHFORIA
cell volumes are smaller than the radio source volumes for all
the resolutions, the cell volumes for the lowest EUHFORIA res-
olution are comparable to the radio source volumes. Therefore,
selection of the intermediate resolution of EUHFORIA is justi-
fied as it is capable of fully capturing the radio variations of the
density for different closely spaced radio source positions. The
jump of the volume at about 37 Ro is due to the larger spread
of the distances between the wave vectors from the triangulation
results as around 650-550 kHz as can be seen in it Fig. 9a.

obtained at the radio source positions are underestimated.

7.3. Density fluctuations in PSP data

Density fluctuations in the solar corona can influence the ob-
served radio source positions (Kontar et al. 2019; Krupar et al.
2020; Jebaraj et al. 2020; Sishtla et al. 2023). In order to under-
stand how strong is the influence of density fluctuations on the
estimated radio source positions in the case of studied type III
bursts, we analyzed fluctuations of the PSP electron density.

With the aim to inspect density fluctuations during longer
time window and obtain more general estimate we considered
the full duration of the second PSP close approach covering
the time interval from 01 April up to 08 April. This time in-
terval covers all selected type III radio bursts (observed between
02 April and 05 April). In order to estimate the level of the small
scale fluctuations, we selected a time scale of one minute during
which PSP encompasses distances which are short in compari-
son to the radio source sizes as presented in Fig. 9. We note that
the temporal resolution of FIELDS/RFS time series is 7 s, while
the full duration of the type III bursts at a considered DF fre-
quencies is about 10 min (Fig 3). Therefore, looking at 1 min
time scale fluctuations seems to be reasonable assumption. We
emphasize that the considered time interval of the PSP observa-

at low, intermediate, and high resolutions, respectively. The EUHFO-

umes and therefore, can effectively model the regions occupied by the
radio sources.

tions is 8 days, during which PSP maps the solar wind plasma
characteristics at distances of about 34-40 Ro which is the re-
gion in which the majority of the radio triangulation points are
located (see Fig. 10). The density fluctuations estimated in such
a way have also the statistical weight, as we sample large portion
of the ambient plasma characteristic. As such the PSP observa-
tions are the best proxy possible for estimation of the density
fluctuations, even if the PSP is not exactly at the same position
as the radio sources. Other ways of estimating density fluctua-
tions e.g. using the remote sensing observations or theoretical
estimations (Thejappa & Kundu 1992; Krupar et al. 2018) are
expected to be less accurate.

We calculate the centered moving averages of the PSP den-
sity (n(t))7, by sliding the time window of 1 minute along the full
considered epoch (Fig. 13b). The maximum fluctuations dn(t)
were then estimated as the difference between the original data
points n(t) and the moving average for the 1 min time window
(Fig. 13c). The instantaneous fluctuations e(t) were calculated as
follows:

Root mean square (RMS) of the relative fluctuations (6,5)
can be calculated as,

Our results show that the €,,,; throughout the given epoch
were about 0.05 (Fig. 13d). If we consider longer time window
of 10 min for estimating moving averages, which will then corre-
spond to a larger scales and it will encompass the whole duration
of the type III bursts, we obtain RMS density fluctuations on av-
erage at the level of about 0.06. We note that even considering
such a longer time window, not really suitable for the study of
short duration type III bursts, the obtained level of density fluc-
tuations remains as small as 6 percent.

authors obtained, at close to the Sun distances for frequen-
cies of about 38.5, 50 and 73.8 MHz, the density fluctuations
of 0.07-0.19, 0.1—0.25, 0.15-0.35, respectively. Employing
Monte Carlo simulation technique Krupar et al. (2018) obtained
0.06—0.07 of relative electron density fluctuations at the dis-
tances between 8 and 45 Ro. We obtained the Sth and 95th per-
centiles of the ms to determine the upper and lower limits of our
results. We then compared these values with those obtained by
Thejappa & Kundu (1992). The fit showed good agreement be-
tween the metric range results and our findings (Fig. 14). These
results indicate that even if the density fluctuations can notice-
ably change at close to the Sun distances they do not seem to
significantly vary in the inner heliosphere.

GONG and ADAPT magnetic maps, respectively. The meridional plots highlight PSP’s trajectory through a high-density, low-velocity region in

both simulations with GONG and ADAPT magnetograms.

It is generally considered that the density fluctuations can in-
fluence the level of the scattering of the radio emission, which
then subsequently also affects the accuracy of the estimated ra-
dio source positions and the sizes of the radio sources (Kontar
et al. 2019; Krupar et al. 2020). In light of our results on the den-
sity fluctuations, obtained from the in situ observation, we can
consider that the scattering effects do not significantly change at
the distances considered in this study. This conclusion is also in
accordance with our findings (see Fig. 9),which shows no sys-
tematic variation of the radio source sizes obtained in this study,
contrary to the results obtained in the metric wavelength range
(Saint-Hilaire et al. 2012).

7.4. Uncertainties and inaccuracies of solar wind density
through modeling and observations

Both, modeling and observations can be influenced by a spec-
trum of different factors that can in different ways introduce un-
certainties and inaccuracies into the results. Knowledge on these
factors is crucial for improving the interpretation of the results

and their significance, derived from both modeling and obser-
vational studies. We will here address some of the factors that
influence the accuracy of results of our study, grouped as uncer-
tainty arising from: a) modeling, b) radio and in situ observations
(already partially discussed in the Section 7.3).

7.4.1. Modeling uncertainties

We will first address the uncertainty in the estimation of the EU-
HFORIA density. In general uncertainties in modeling can arise
due to different factors and we describe only the most impor-
tant one such as the model set up, the limitations in the input
data, modeling assumptions and modeling limitations in a case
of complex events.

The main input to EUHFORIA are 360° magnetic synop-
tic maps which are available from different providers and can
differ significantly. As a result, such diverse synoptic maps can
strongly influence modeled solar wind characteristics (Riley
et al. 2012, 2014; Riley et al. 2021; Perri et al. 2023). Further,
synoptic magnetograms are constructed using the ‘old’ informa-

tion for the far-side of the Sun. This is particularly important
when modeling solar wind and the events at/behind the East so-
lar limb, for which the magnetogram input is almost half solar
rotation old. We note that this was exactly the case in our study.
These uncertainties could be fully addressed only if the 360° ob-
servations of the Sun are available.

The EUHFORIA results also showed that the use of different
magnetic maps, namely GONG and ADAPT, can lead to dif-
ferent simulation results (Fig. lla & b). Figure 15 shows the
equatorial and meridional slices of the EUHFORIA domain ob-
tained using GONG and ADAPT synoptic maps, respectively.
Although both results display high density regions along the PSP
propagation path (fig. 15a & c), the overall density structures dif-
fer from each other.

Another factor that gives rise to the uncertainty in the mod-
eling results is the simplicity of the EUHFORIA’s coronal model
(Hinterreiter et al. 2019). Some of the recent studies indicate
that more advanced coronal models, than the herein used default
coronal model of EUHFORIA, may increase the accuracy of EU-
HFORIA (Samara et al. 2021). Additionally, the more accurate
background solar wind is expected in the case of time-dependent
modeling (Baratashvili et al. 2025).

Furthermore, EUHFORIA strongly relies on the solar wind
boundary conditions used as an input to the heliospheric model,
such as fast solar wind density and velocity (Pomoell & Poedts
2018). The improvements of this modeling input could be still
expected from the upcoming in situ solar wind observations by
the current novel missions such as PSP and SolO (Solar Orbiter;
Miller et al. 2020).

7.4.2. Uncertainties induced with in situ & radio observations

Since 2018 and its first close approach PSP provides us with a
large amount of close-to-the-Sun in situ observations. As PSP
orbits the Sun and approaches its perihelion, it maps the local
coronal plasma properties in high temporal resolution at con-
stantly changing positions. PSP in situ observations show that, in
general, the electron density of the coronal plasma vary by about

Article number, page 16 of 20

one order of magnitude (Kruparova et al. 2023). Therefore, when
comparing the electron density obtained from radio observations
with those from PSP in situ measurements, it is important to un-
derstand that different position and trajectories of PSP and radio
sources will probably result in different coronal electron densi-
ties. For more detailed discussion see also Section 7.3.

The dynamic spectra from PSP provide valuable informa-
tion regarding observed type II radio bursts. With PSP’s high-
resolution data we can identify multiple type III bursts that are
not fully resolved in the dynamic spectra from Wind or STEREO
due to their lower temporal resolution. Sometimes, type III bursts
occurring subsequently within a short time interval of e.g. few
minutes can be identified in Wind and STEREO dynamic spec-
tra as a group of bursts which are not fully resolved. On the other
hand the time series of the same type III radio bursts at discrete
frequency will show only complex time profile, suggesting the
presence of more than one type III radio bursts (Gerekos et al.
2024) but without any certainty. This difference arises from the
additional information provided with large frequency range in
dynamic spectra. The complex time profile is also accompanied
with the fluctuating values of azimuth and colatitude of the DF
observations, leading at the end to decreased accuracy in esti-
mation of the radio source positions (Deshpande et al., in prep.).
In order to avoid this uncertainty we selected type III burst as
isolated as possible. Additionally, when selecting the time se-
ries points for triangulation we aimed at those that had the least
fluctuations of the azimuth and colatitude components for the
subsequent measurements and were close to the peak intensity
of the burst time profile. We need to note that in the case of our
study the direction of propagation of the radio sources obtained
from the DF generally stays conserved (Figs. 7 and 8) as the
scattering effects do not seem to be significant. The confirmation
of that, beyond here presented study and other already published
works (Magdaleni¢ et al. 2014; Jebaraj et al. 2020) which shows
the similar results, is also visible in the Fig. 16 of the manuscript
where it is clearly shown that the type III radio sources propa-
gate along the magnetic field lines obtained independently using
the 3D MHD EUHFORIA code.
K. Deshpande, et. al.: Coronal electron density: Insights from observations and modeling

PSP measurements reveal sometimes very large fluctuations
of the local electron density highlighting the turbulent nature of
the solar corona. Given this highly dynamic behavior of the so-
lar wind plasma, accurately estimated radio source positions are
crucial for mapping correct electron densities. Accurate estima-
tion of the radio source sizes is also important, as errors in source
size estimation can result in incorrect density assumptions for
the large solar wind regions. To decrease the level of these un-
certainties we need to try to avoid the bursts with the complex
time profiles.

8. Discussion and conclusions

This study presents the radio triangulation of interplanetary type
III bursts and characteristic of the obtained radio sources. The re-
sults of analysis of radio bursts is employed in the study focused
to the coronal electron density obtained using different methods.
We inspect electron density estimated with type III radio bursts,
novel PSP observations and EUHFORIA modeling results. The
main focus of the study is to map the electron density in the in-
terplanetary space, as accurate as possible, and inter-validate the
results obtained with radio observations and EUHFORIA.

Our study encompasses 11 type III radio bursts observed dur-
ing the second PSP perihelion. The selected bursts were required
to be intense, isolated from the other types of bursts and ob-
served by both Wind and STEREO-A spacecrafts. STREREO-A
and PSP instruments observed multiple type III radio bursts dur-
ing the 2nd PSP perihelion. However, only few of them were
observed by Wind. This might be because of the different prop-
agation path of the bursts and/or the low temporal resolution of
the Wind instrument. This condition restricted the selection of
the bursts for which triangulation can be applied.

The studied radio events were associated with the AR
(NOAA AR 12738) located behind the east solar limb. The EUV
observations show association between EUV jets observed in all
four frequency channels of STEREO-A/EUVI and accelerated
electrons which produced radio bursts. Such a scenario was also
reported in some previous studies (e.g. Bain & Fletcher 2009;
Klassen et al. 2011; Krucker et al. 2011; Mccauley et al. 2017;
Cairns et al. 2018; Mulay et al. 2019). The recent work which
focused on type III radio bursts observed within the same period
around second PSP perihelion (Pulupa et al. 2020; Krupar et al.
2020; Harra et al. 2021; Stanislavsky et al. 2022; Wang et al.
2023; Nedal et al. 2023), showed that the type III bursts were as-
sociated with the jets from the AR 12738 which also agrees with
our findings herein.

Understanding the characteristics of the time profiles is cru-
cial for assessing the reliability of radio triangulation results.
Namely, presence of the close in time subsequent burst, or the
simultaneous presence of the fundamental and harmonic com-
ponent will induce the inaccuracy in the triangulation results.
Therefore, in order to understand how precise our results are,
we analyzed the time profiles of selected bursts observed by
STEREO-A and Wind (Fig. 4). STEREO-A showed complex-
ity in the time profiles confirming the presence of more than one
type III radio bursts in a few studied events (Event 7, 10 and 12).
On the other hand Wind observations of the same bursts showed
a single-peak time profile. This can be also due to the low inten-
sity and/or low temporal resolution of Wind data.

Results for the Event 8 and Event 9 are presented in detail
in this paper. Radio triangulation method provided us 3D radio
source positions and allowed us to map the direction of propaga-
tion of the type II bursts which was not along the direction of the
Parker spirals. Event 8 showed downward propagation path from

the ecliptic plane, whereas Event 9 showed direction of propaga-
tion along the ecliptic plane (Fig. 7). This result shows that the
propagation path of the subsequent type III radio bursts observed
within few minutes and originating from the same AR was along
different magnetic field lines (Magdalenic et al., in prep.). We,
note that even if the subsequent type III bursts are originating
from the same AR they might not have the same propagation
path. Jebaraj et al. (2020) showed that two groups of type II
bursts from the same radio event propagated along the different
flanks of the CME and very distinct magnetic field lines. Herein
presented results and the one by Jebaraj et al. (2020) show that
contrary to the generally considered fact, propagation path of
subsequent type III bursts can be very different, following dis-
tinctively different field lines and not following Parker spiral.
On the other hand, all studied type III radio bursts which origi-
nate from the same AR in the course of 4 days have comparable
propagation path as visible from Fig. 8a. Moreover, subsequent
bursts seem to follow the propagation of the AR, with the ap-
parent movement of the AR across the solar disk as observed
from STEREO-A, showing the angular spread when viewed in
the ecliptic plane (Fig. 8b).

We found that radio source size, defined as the shortest dis-
tance between the wave vectors (Fig. 1), ranges from 0.5 — 40 deg
or 0.5—25 Ro (Fig. 9). Obtained source sizes do not exhibit any
clear dependence on the observing frequency, suggesting that
scattering effects are not significant in this frequency range and
in the case of studied events. This finding indicates that while ra-
dio wave scattering can influence observed source positions, its
impact might be less significant at the distances and frequencies
considered in this study. The radio source positions at the higher
frequencies cluster closer to the Sun while the low frequency
sources (e.g. 425 kHz) appear further away from the Sun, as see
in Fig. 8b. This behavior follows from the direct proportionality
of the plasma frequency and coronal electron density (Eq. 2). We
note that even if study is based on the 11 type III bursts which is
not a large number at each triangulation frequency pair several
data points were considered resulting in the significant number
of radio source positions and sizes (Fig. 9) making our results
also statistically firm.

The radio triangulation provided 3D radio source positions
which were used to map the electron density in the inner helio-
sphere (Equation 2). The radio density when compared with the
1D models (Newkirk 1961; Saito 1970; Leblanc et al. 1995; Vrs-
nak et al. 2004; Kruparova et al. 2023; Fig. 10), were found to be
along the 20 x Leblanc model with the lower edge comparable
to 3.5 x Saito. The average PSP densities over the 10 first perihe-
lion passages (Kruparova et al. 2023) are about an order magni-
tude lower than the radio density profiles. One of the reasons for
the obtained difference is probably different speed and propaga-
tion path of the type III bursts and PSP. The type III radio bursts
propagate with the speed of a fraction of speed-of-light along the
magnetic filed lines, approximately radially away from the Sun.
In the same time PSP propagates significantly slower than radio
bursts and more perpendicular to the solar wind flow. Therefore,
PSP and radio bursts encompass very different portions of the
corona during the type II duration. While single type III bursts
encompasses distances from about 0.12 au down to 0.2 au, PSP
encompasses only about 0.0008 au. Therefore, the variation of
PSP density is expected to be low in comparison to the radio
density.

Another reason for discrepancy between radio and PSP den-
sity is still notably different starting position of PSP and type
Ill radio bursts. The combined analysis of the SOHO/LASCO
and STEREO COR2 images (Fig. 6) with EUHFORIA model-

ing results (Fig. 15 panels (a) & (b), and Fig. 16) show strong
variations and structuring of the solar wind velocity/density in
the regions of PSP and type III radio sources. At the beginning of
the perihelion passage PSP propagates across the regions of slow
solar wind probably originating from the equatorial streamer belt
region composed of at least 3 distinguishable streamers stretch-
ing outwards in the radial direction (Fig. 6). Starting from the
03 April and during the Event 8, PSP propagates in the fast so-
lar wind characterized with the speed reaching up to 600 km/s
and with the low density of about few hundred particles/cm*, as
seen from Fig. 11. The solar wind density fluctuations mapped
by PSP show variation of very local plasma condition in PSP
vicinity. On the other hand the type III radio sources which prop-
agate along the magnetic filed lines, seem to be situated within
different slow solar wind stream which also indicates different
density regime. We concluded that strong structuring of the solar
wind density which is mapped very locally by both radio sources
and PSP, also attributes to the significant difference between the
radio density and the PSP densities for the studied events.

The space weather model EUHFORIA was employed to es-
timate the densities at PSP and radio source positions for Event 8
(as sketched in Fig. 2b). Initially, we used GONG magnetograms
as input to EUHFORIA to estimate the densities at PSP posi-
tion. The simulations performed with the default PFSS SSR of
2.6 Ro underestimated the densities compared to PSP in situ ob-
servations (Fig. 11a). To exclude the possibility of opening the
magnetic field lines that are in reality closed and considered as
such when using the default PFSS SSR, we gradually increased
the SSR to 3.0 Ro. Increasing SSR resulted in a better agreement
with the in situ densities at PSP position but still did not fully
match PSP density. Therefore, we employed ADAPT magnetic
maps as input to EUHFORIA using the default PFSS SSR value.
All ADAPT realizations yielded higher densities compared to
those obtained with GONG magnetic maps, and they showed
better agreement with PSP in situ density (Fig. 11b).

We then compared the radio densities at all direction-finding
frequencies with the EUHFORIA densities at the correspond-
ing radio source positions for Event 8. The radio densities were
higher by one order of magnitude than PSP in situ densities.
Whereas, the densities obtained with EUHFORIA at the radio
source positions are observed to be lower than the one obtained
with the radio and in situ observations (Fig. 11 c to h). Despite
the obtained discrepancies EUHFORIA did predicted denser re-
gion along the propagation path of the type III bursts (Fig. 15).

The comparison of in situ, radio, and EUHFORIA density
revealed differences which pointed to the necessity to discuss
uncertainties associated with employed methods of density es-
timation. The discrepancy in the results could be attributed to
several factors. One key aspect is the modeling process itself, as
EUHFORIA relies heavily on the provided input data. The most
important parameter is the synoptic magnetic field map used as
the main model input. It is needed to note that all the events ana-
lyzed in this study had source region located behind the east so-
lar limb. Accordingly, the magnetic field information was almost
half solar rotation old. This uncertainty can be only corrected by
employing 360° magnetic field observations of the Sun.

The accuracy of EUHFORIA’s modeling results is also in-
fluenced by the simplicity of its coronal model, with recent stud-
ies suggesting that more advanced models should be used (Hin-
terreiter et al. 2019; Samara et al. 2021). Additionally, time-
dependent modeling is expected to further improve the accuracy
of the background solar wind predictions. EUHFORIA’s reliance
on solar wind boundary input parameters, such as fast wind den-
sity and velocity, means that novel in situ observations from mis-

sions like PSP and SolO could provide more realistic boundary
conditions for EUHFORIA.

PSP’s high-resolution in situ measurements have shown that
coronal electron densities vary by an order of magnitude, em-
phasizing the importance of considering different positions and
trajectories when comparing radio and in situ density measure-
ments. Furthermore, PSP’s dynamic spectra indicated the pres-
ence of multiple type III bursts that generally remain undetected
in the lower-resolution data from Wind and STEREO. This find-
ings emphasis the complexity of the studied signals and poten-
tial inaccuracies in radio source positioning through triangula-
tion. Given the highly dynamic and turbulent nature of the so-
lar corona, precise identification of mapped regions is crucial
for density measurements. Moreover, errors in estimating radio
source sizes can lead to incorrect density assumptions, introduc-
ing additional uncertainties in the results.

Our analysis of PSP electron density variations indicates that
small-scale RMS density fluctuations are around 0.05. When
considering a longer time window of 10 minutes, which encom-
passes the full duration of a single type III radio burst, the RMS
density fluctuations increase to approximately 0.06. These re-
sults suggest that while density fluctuations can impact radio
wave scattering and therefore also radio source positions, they
do not show significant variation across the inner heliosphere at
the distances analyzed in this study.

We note that both independently obtained results; a) on the
behavior of the radio source sizes obtained in radio triangulation
and the b) on the density fluctuations from the PSP observations
indicate low level of scattering effects for the studied events.
Similar results on the scattering effects for the metric range radio
bursts were recently obtained by Kumari et al. (2025).

The main conclusions of the performed studies are listed
here:

e Radio triangulation results of Event 8 showed propagation
path of the radio sources southward from the ecliptic plane,
whereas, radio sources in Event 9 propagated along the eclip-
tic plane. We conclude that the subsequent type III bursts can
propagate along different propagation path and along differ-
ent magnetic filed lines, even though they are generated from
the same AR.

e When all the studied events were plotted together, the ma-
jority showed a southward propagation path from the solar
ecliptic plane. This suggests that presence of different long-
living coronal structures, such as coronal streamers, and dy-
namic changes in the ambient coronal magnetic field config-
uration caused by solar activity, such as CMEs, can signifi-
cantly influence the propagation path of type III radio bursts.

e We have found that the radio source sizes were relatively
small compared to some previous studies and in the range of
0.5—40 deg or between 0.5—25 Ro. Radio source sizes did
not show systematic variation with the frequency and there-
fore, scattering which is expected to directly influence radio
source positions and sizes, as a function of the local elec-
tron density, might not be significant in this frequency range.
This conclusion is confirmed with the low level of the density
fluctuations, generally responsible for the scattering effects,
obtained from the PSP in situ data.

e The uncertainties on the coronal electron densities obtained
from comparison of radio, PSP and EUHFORIA densities
are mainly due to :

— Different propagation path of type III radio bursts and
PSP indicates that we are mapping different coronal re-
gions.

K. Deshpande, et. al.: Coronal electron density: Insights from observations and modeling

— Type III radio bursts might be propagating along coronal
streamer lines, which then explains the high radio densi-
ties.

— AR associated with type III radio bursts was behind
east solar limb. Consequently, magnetic maps were con-
structed with almost half solar rotation old information
which strongly influences the accuracy of the modeling
results.

— Magnetograms obtained from different providers can in-
duce very different modeling results.

— Simplicity of the coronal model of our MHD code EUH-
FORIA (Pomoell & Poedts 2018) and time independent
nature of the model might contribute the model accuracy.

e Despite the relative differences in the three types of electron
densities, we can note that, EUHFORIA rather successfully
identified regions of increased density along the propagation
paths of type III radio bursts, demonstrating its capability to
capture broader density structures in the heliosphere.

e The obtained behavior of the radio sources and the density
fluctuation analysis of PSP in situ data showed that the scat-
tering effects do not change significantly at the distances con-
sidered in this study.

The current high level of the solar activity is expected to pro-
vide us with PSP and SolO observations which will bring us new
opportunities to expand this work even further. Our study was
limited to the second perihelion due to restrictions in the sepa-
ration angle of STEREO-A and Wind, which are crucial for ra-
dio triangulation. However, future observations will benefit from
more favorable spacecraft alignments, allowing for the analy-
sis of a larger number of events. Additionally, PSP’s improved
time resolution of 0.3 seconds will facilitate a more detailed in-
vestigation of radio events. The newly launched PROBA-3 mis-
sion along with ground-based observational opportunities, will
further enhance our ability to probe the lower corona, provid-
ing deeper insights into the origin and propagation of solar ra-
dio emission. The recently developed coronal model COCONUT
(Perri et al. 2022, 2023), will, together with the time-dependent
version of EUHFORIA provide more accurate modeling results.
We believe that these advancements will even more improve our
understanding of electron density variations and the physics of
the solar radio bursts in the inner heliosphere.
