Abstract

We have investigated the prospects of probing the five-dimensional U(1)z,,—L, interactions
in present and future muon dump experiments, namely, NA64,,, M?, MuSIC, and a future
muon beam dump experiment. These experiments are classified into two categories: the first
two can probe processes where feebly interacting massive particles go into invisible channels,
while the latter two can probe processes where these states decay into muon pairs. These two
types of experiments are complementary in that they allow exploration of different param-
eter regions of a model. In our scenario, the presence of multiple massive gauge bosons as
Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles leads to an enhancement in the signal events compared to the
corresponding four-dimensional scenario. In particular, the decay process into muon pairs
enables mass reconstruction of the parent particle, making it possible to directly demonstrate
the existence of multiple KK particles in at least some parameter regions. This can provide
clear evidence that the origin of the U(1)z,,-1, interaction lies in five dimensions. Further-
more, the muon (g — 2) value, which is now consistent with the SM, can be used to exclude
specific parameter regions for new particles interacting with muons. We also carefully discuss
the non-trivial effects arising from nonzero kinetic mixing.

1 Introduction

In recent years, significant attention has been paid to light particles that couple with the Standard
Model (SM) sector feebly, motivated by addressing the issues that cannot be solved within the
SM, e.g., dark matter, neutrino profiles and others; a recent review is available in Ref. [1]. The
search for such particles is considered one of the most intriguing topics in particle phenomenology
today.

When the mass of such particles is in the MeV range or GeV range but not particularly heavy,
fixed-target beam-dump experiments are highly effective as a search method. Examples of such
experiments conducted in the past include the following: CHARM [2], KEK [3], E141 [4], £137 [5],
Orsay [6], E774 [7], LSND [8], NOMAD [9], and NA64 [10], which are classified according to the
type of incident beam: protons [2, 8, 9] and electrons [3-7, 10].

Generally proton or electron beams are used in such experiments. However, recently, new types
of beam dump experiments have been discussed, where the incident beam consists of particles other
than protons and electrons.1. Among these, one particularly interesting option is to use muons
as the incident beam.? Various theoretical papers have already been published [39-55], and an
experiment, NA64,,, is already underway [56, 57]. Naturally, these experiments are very useful to
probe theoretical frameworks consisting of new feebly interacting light particles which couple to
muons.

One such interesting model incorporates an additional U(1);,-1, symmetry within the gauge
sector [58-61]. This gauge extension is especially attractive as it is anomaly-free without in-
troducing the right-handed neutrinos. This interaction works well as a mediator for light dark
matter [62-79] and as an explanation for the Hubble tension [80-83].°

In our previous study [85], we looked into a five-dimensional (5D) version of the basic U(1)r,,—-1,
framework that added a single compact spatial dimension. The U(1),,-1, gauge symmetry spreads
out in the 5D bulk, introducing an infinite number of gauge bosons that are seen as Kaluza-Klein
(KK) modes [86] from a four-dimensional (4D) point of view. In this method, the source of the MeV
to GeV mass scale can be directly connected to the inverse size of the compact extra dimension
under a twisted boundary condition, without the introduction of a new scalar boson. This gives
physics beyond the Standard Model a bigger framework. In [85], as the first survey, we employed
electron-neutrino elastic scattering (EVES), specifically the interaction evy + evx (X : e,é@, MU, ft).
To illustrate our methodology, we examined data from studies Borexino [87], TEXONO [88], and
CHARM-II [89, 90] and considered the future prospects in DUNE [91, 92]. Note that Section one
of our previous work [85] contains a list of other kinds of constraints on the 4D U(1)z,,-1, scenario.

However, in the context of U(1)z,-1, gauge extension, the massive gauge bosons interact with
electrons only through kinetic mixing terms [93]. So, through EvES, direct searches for muon
interactions are not possible. The ongoing and proposed muon beam dump experiments, such
as, NA64,, [94], M® [40], MuSIC [43, 46], and a future muon dump experiment [45], provide an
excellent avenue to directly probe such interactions for muons, even in scenarios with negligible
kinetic mixing. These four experiments provide complementary results focusing on two decay

TAt the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a next-generation proton beam dump experiment, SHiP, is sched-
uled [11, 12]. Also, the FASER experiment has been investigating new feebly interacting light particles with a
displaced detector, as well as studying high-energy neutrinos [13, 14]. See [15] for the Forward Physics Facility at
the High-Luminosity LHC. Note that the bounds have been reported by the ATLAS [16-21] and LHCb [22, 23]
collaborations.

Other such options are positrons [24~36], charged pions [37], and photons [36, 38].

3Previously, this interaction had been noted for resolving discrepancies with the SM predictions for muon (g—2).
The latest SM value is aj*P — ane = 38(63) x 107", which is consistent within ~0.6o [84].

processes of the massive gauge boson Z’, produced via Bremsstrahlung from a muon beam: Z’ >
invisible (NA64, and M?) and Z’ + yo pt (MuSIC and a future muon dump experiment). In
our framework, the existence of multiple Z’ candidates leads to enhanced experimental sensitivity
and a correspondingly broader scope for examining constraints and future prospects than in the
4D counterpart. In particular, the decay of Z’ into muon pairs is interesting because it allows for
signal reconstruction, enabling direct confirmation of the existence of multiple vector bosons.

This paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we introduce our 5D U(1)z,-1, scenario. In
Section 3, we provide the formulas for the signal process via massive-vector Bremsstrahlung in 4D
and 5D. In Section 4, the details of the four muon beam dump experiments and how to estimate
the number of signal events are explained. Section 5 provides numerical results and current status
and prospects of our scenario in the future experiments, covering both cases where the kinetic
mixing effect is zero and non-zero. Section 6 is devoted to providing a summary and discussion.
In Appendix A, complementary plots are shown for the validity of our analysis.

2 Model Specifications

This part gives a short summary of the five-dimensional U(1),,,-1, framework with an extra
small spatial dimension. In this setup, all SM particles are stuck on a three-dimensional brane
at y = ysm. The U(1) L,-L, gauge boson and its KK excitations, on the other hand, can move
through the five-dimensional bulk.

We use the coordinate y € [0, 7R] to describe the extra spatial dimension, where R is the radius
of compactification. It is assumed that the SM brane can be anywhere in the extra dimension,
including the ends, and that its position is a free parameter. This generalisation is given so that a
more thorough phenomenological study can be done. This study focuses merely on the flat extra-
dimensional case. We use twisted boundary conditions on the five-dimensional U(1),,-1, gauge
field: Neumann boundary conditions at y = 0 and Dirichlet boundary conditions at y = 7R. As
a result, there is no massless mode in the KK spectrum. Without using the Higgs mechanism or
adding an extra singlet scalar field, the massless mode is taken away. The 5D U(1)z,-1, gauge
coupling gp is not dimensionless and has the mass dimension —1/2. In 4D effective theories, it
is always accompanied by V7R as the combination g/ = Gen/ VaR, and we can consider g! as a
fundamental parameter.

grounds together. This paper focuses on the phenomenology of the flat case. The Lagrangian

3 Cross section formula for light 7’ Bremsstrahlung

3.1 4D U(1)r,-1, Case

In beam-dump experiments for light new particle searches, the significant process is the initial and
final-state radiation (Bremsstrahlung) off an accelerated charged lepton, which bombards an atom
of a fixed target. For experiments involving an incident muon-beam, the relevant process and the
kinematics are given by

i(p) + ACP) > p(p') + A(P5) + 2"(k), (3.1)

where the corresponding Feynman diagrams are shown in Fig. 1. A denotes an atom of the target,
and p, P; = (M;,0), p’, Py and k are the four momenta in the lab frame, where M; is the mass of
the target atom which is stationary in the lab frame.

The cross section of the Z’-boson Bremsstrahlung was formulated in [95] for the dark photon,
based on the discussion on the axion-Bremsstrahlung off an electron beam [96]. If the initial
charged lepton (muon) is sufficiently accelerated, the Weizsicker-Williams (WW) approximation
is applicable [95-100]; see also [44, 101-103] for detailed verifications/application limits of this

(see Eq. (3.1) and Fig. 1) into a simpler 2 > 2 scattering process (Fig. 2) by factoring out the
photon flux via the target atom.”

More precisely, this approximation is valid when the beam energy is much larger than both the
muon mass m, and the mass of the new vector boson mz. Under these conditions, the differential
cross section for the full 2 + 3 process (do¥’,,) is factorised and can be written as

integration in processes involving high-energy charged particles. It effectively models the interaction of a relativistic
charged particle with an external electromagnetic field as a flux of equivalent real photons. Initially designed for
bremsstrahlung calculations and later applied in fixed-target and beam-dump studies. Furthermore, an investigation
into the nonzero momentum transfer in the Bremsstrahlung from the proton is found in [104] (see also [105-107]).

where {7 is the boost factor of the outgoing Z’ in the lab frame, q represents the four momentum

we ignored the terms proportional to mi. Also, the form of Eq. (3.2) agrees with that of Eq. (A12
of [95], up to the difference in the types of the U(1) interactions.

The photon flux yz appearing in Eq. (3.2) is determined by the electric form factor Go(t

the proton (in nuclear magneton). The total electric form factor is given by,

Go(t) = Gra(t) + Grin(Z). (3.12)

Owing to tmax = m3, in Eq. (3.9), for heavier Z’, the associated momentum transfer to the
nucleus t becomes larger, causing the recoil to probe progressively shorter-distance nuclear struc-
tures. For such energetic domains, additional contributions can arise via the photon exchange in
the deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) regime. A simple but reasonable criterion can take

tmin 2 1 GeV? (as an estimation of the DIS-active domain) [53] (see also [95]). (3.13)

Also, we comment on the properties of the photon flux yz in Eq. (3.8): (i) For a larger Eo (with
focusing on a specific mz), tmin is smaller, and eventually yz becomes larger; (ii) For a significantly
large mz (with focusing on a specific Eo), tmin becomes larger and yz: becomes very small.

®The choice of target material varies across the considered experiments. For the NA64,, experiment, the target
is lead with atomic number Z = 82 and mass number A = 207.2. In the MuSIC setup, gold is used as the target
material, characterised by Z = 79 and A = 196.97. The M?® experiment employs tungsten, with Z = 74 and
A = 183.84. Finally, for the proposed future muon beam dump experiment, the target is water, with an effective
average atomic number Z = 10 and mass number A = 18 [111].

Here, m; denotes the mass of the muon or tau lepton, and the above expressions are written under
the assumption that no additional contributions from kinetic mixing are present.

We can also recast the differential cross section in Eq. (3.2) in terms of the boost factor y and
pseudorapidity 7 of the Z’ in the lab frame, using the relations [95]:!°

Finally, we will mention another possible amplitude for the signal process ~~ A > uw~ AZ’. I
Z' is attached to quarks via the nonzero kinetic mixing, Z’ can be emitted from a proton of the
target, and the doubly virtual Compton scattering (VVCS) off the hadronic state is not always
suppressed [112]. In the case of the dark photon search in a tantalum-targetted electron beam
dump experiment, the authors of [112] showed that the VVCS signal process provides a ~10%
extra contribution if the mass of the dark photon is sufficiently lighter than the initial beam
energy. Of course, when the kinetic mixing is set to zero, this contribution vanishes. However, if
we consider the case where the kinetic mixing is nonzero, we should bear this in mind."

©The integration over the angle is performed by substituting the variable u with cos@z’. For details, refer to
Appendix A in [95].

l0Note that the following expression of the pseudorapidity is equivalent to the definition 7 = —In [tan()] ; where

"Tn Ref. [112], another possibility of the signal process for the final state e~ A > e~ A (I7I*) (1 being a charged
lepton) was examined through a Bethe-Heitler trident production with a spacelike Z’. The authors of [112] concluded
that this is negligible.

3.2 Extra-Dimensional U(1),,-;, Case with kinetic mixing

As introduced in Section 2, the (minimal) five-dimensional U(1);,,-1, Scenario includes multiple Z’
bosons as KK vector bosons as Z’") (n = 1,2,3,--+). As we will see later, their decay widths are
proportional to their physical masses, and higher modes rapidly decay compared with lower modes.
So, the interference effects between different KK modes (as intermediate states of the full chain of
pA pw A(Z ey" + pw Aff; f isa U(1)r,—-1,-charged SM fermion) are negligible. Further, the
narrow decay widths of these KK modes as compared to the mass difference of two adjacent states
imply that the resonances do not overlap, and that the cross section can be accurately estimated
by considering one (on-shell) KK mode at a time, which decays to ff. Therefore, we need only
consider the cross sections of Bremsstrahlung for each KK vector boson separately.

Under the above approximation, the calculation of each cross section is very straightforward. In
the following, we derive a more complete expression that does not neglect the term proportional to
the muon mass in the numerator, which we will use in our analysis. Using the WW approximation
introduced in Section 3.1, the differential cross section of the 2 + 3 process involving the n-th KK
mode Z’) involving in the final state can be calculated in terms of the energy fraction x and the

Here, there are two differences between the formula for the 4D U(1),,-1, Z’ in Eq. (3.14) and
one of the 5D ones in Eq. (3.21). One is apparent; the gauge-boson mass mz, should be replaced
with the corresponding KK mass M,.'* The other one is more nontrivial. Due to the kinetic
mixing effect, the axial-vector coupling is present, and the form of the differential cross section
becomes more involved. We point out that, if we take the limits ong — 0 (realised by €, + 0

4 Experimental Setups and Signal Estimations

We focus on the following muon beam dump experiments: NA64,, M?, MuSIC, and a future
muon beam dump, where the first two and the last two experiments investigate the decay channels
Z' — invisible and Z’ + p71", respectively. In what follows, one by one, we describe the methods
for connecting the cross section formula for the emission of Z' or Z' (n = 1,2,3,-++), as discussed
in Section 3, to the number of events in the experiment.

4.1 NA64,: Beam-Dump Experiment at CERN

NA64,, is a fixed-target beam-dump experiment at CERN, employing a 160 GeV muon beam from
the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) [117]. Its primary goal is to search for invisible decays of a
light vector boson Z’, produced via a bremsstrahlung process,

pe A(Pb) + pw A(Pb) Z', Z' — invisible,

where the target is made of lead (Pb) [57]. Note that, for the 4D U(1)z,,-1, scenario, the invisible
final state dominantly consists of Z' > v,7; and Z' — v,7;. In the presence of non-vanishing
kinetic mixing, the channel Z’ + v.7 may also be relevant. For later convenience, we introduce
the notation VD := yee yr YoVa-

The experimental signature is characterised by a single scattered muon carrying less than
80 GeV of energy, with no accompanying activity in the downstream detectors. In the 2022 run,
the experiment collected a dataset corresponding to (1.98 + 0.02) x 10!° muons on target (Nor),
and the future upgrades are expected to achieve 10'% muons on target [57].

In the 4D framework, the expected number of signal events corresponding to invisible decays
of the form Z’ + vv at the NA64, experiment is given by [39, 118}:

Neignal = F553 JG dE dx —* Br(Z’ N ), 41
gnal (dE, /dy) of t— 1(Z’ — vv) N (mz) (4.1)

Euymin Lmin

where do¥',,/dx and Br(Z’ — vv) represent the differential cross section and the branching ratio
for the event (refer to Section 3 for the details). Nuor is the total number of muons on target, and
npp = 3.3 x 10? em [111] denotes the number density of lead nuclei in the target. The quantity
(dE,,/dy) represents the average energy loss per unit length for muons traversing the lead target.
When looking at energies between a few GeV and about 160 GeV, muon energy loss is mostly
caused by ionisation processes [94]. It is safe to assume that (dE,,/dy) is independent of energy
because it does not change much with the muon momentum in this range. For lead, we adopt the
value (dE,,/dy) = 12.7 x 10°? GeV/cm [111]. The integration is performed over the penetrating
muon energy E,,, ranging from

Pera = £y,beam — Lr (dE,,/dy), Ei sp = /y,beam; (4.2)

where Ej,,beam © 160 GeV is the initial beam energy and Lr = 20cm is the total target length [118].
The integration range for the energy fraction «x is taken as in Eq. (3.15), ensuring physical consis-
tency in the production process [44].

12
N(mz) is a normalisation factor treated as a function of the Z’ mass. This factor accounts
for background normalisation and has been calibrated using the 4D results reported by the NA64,,
experimental analysis (given in Fig. 3 of [57]) for the current bound corresponding to Nvor ©
2x 101°. For the projected sensitivity with Nor = 10 (future bound), we assume a background-
free scenario, and thus take N(mz-) = 1. A 90% confidence level exclusion bound is imposed by
requiring Ngignal > 2.3 in the (mz, g') parameter space [94, 119].

In the case of the 5D scenario, the Z’ boson is replaced by a tower of KK excitations, each
denoted 7’). The corresponding signal yield is obtained by modifying Eq. (4.1) for each KK
mode as

where, as discussed in the first part of this section, the total number of signal events is provided
as the sum of each Z'”)’s contribution, up to the nxKmax-mode. Here, the variable for integration
x should be understood as « = E’zin)/Eo, where its domain is appropriately recognised as re =
M,,/Ey and «2 = 1 —m,/Ep (see Eq. (3.15).

N(M,,) is the normalisation factor, defined as a function of the KK-mode mass M,,. For the
current bound, this factor is taken to be the same as in the 4D scenario in order to account for
background contributions. For the projected future bound under the assumption of a background-
free analysis, we set N(M,,) = 1.

4.2. M°: Muon Missing Momentum Experiment at Fermilab

The M® experiment is a proposed fixed-target initiative at the Fermilab Accelerator Complex,
designed to explore new muon-philic particles that decay invisibly [39, 40]. The experimental
concept builds upon the design principles of the LDMX experiment [120, 121], utilising a high-
intensity 15 GeV muon beam to probe final states characterised by substantial missing momentum,
which may signal the emission of undetected particles such as dark photons or new gauge bosons.
The signal process is

pe A(W) > pw A(W) Z’,  Z' — invisible,

where the target is made of tungsten (W) [40].

The detector architecture features a precision tracking system positioned both upstream and
downstream of a thick tungsten target of approximately 50 Xo, enabling accurate measurement of
the incoming and outgoing muon momenta. A downstream electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL)
and hadronic calorimeter (HCAL) system serves to veto visible final-state activity and suppress
SM backgrounds. The experimental program is expected to proceed in two phases [40]:

e Phase 1: Nyor = 10!° muons on target and is primarily sensitive to light mediators with
masses mz < 500 MeV.

e Phase 2: Nwor = 10° muons with enhanced veto capabilities, targeting background rejec-
tion at the 107! level.

In the 4D framework, the expected number of signal events for invisible decays of the type Z' > pv
is given by [39, 40]:

which takes a similar form as in Eq. (4.1) for the NA64, experiment. nw = 6.3199 x 10? cm?

denotes the number density of tungsten nuclei in the target material [111], while (dE,,/dy) = 22.1«
10-% GeV /cm represents the average energy loss per unit length for muons traversing tungsten [39].
The integration over the penetrating muon energy £,, extends as in Eq. (4.2), whereas the incident
muon beam energy is taken to be Eybeam & 15GeV [40]. The target thickness is set to Lr =
17.52 cm, corresponding to a material configuration with 100% tungsten purity and equivalent to a
radiation length of 50 Xo [111, 118]. The integration limits for the energy fraction x are determine
as in Eq. (3.15), which ensure the physical validity of the production process [44].

The factor a(2,mz-) represents the detector acceptance as a function of « and mz, extracte
by interpolating the data provided in Fig. 5 of [40]. In this analysis, we approximate the decay
probability density per unit length as unity, justified by the thick-target regime, the invisibility o
the final-state particles, and the fact that all geometric and detector efficiency effects are already
incorporated into the acceptance factor a(a,mz-), as described in [40]. A 90% confidence leve
exclusion bound is imposed by requiring the predicted number of signal events to satisfy Neignal >
2.3 [122].

In ED extensions, the Z’ boson is generalised to a tower of KK excitations, denoted by Z’™).
The corresponding signal yield generalizes Eq. (4.4) as:

The factor a(x,M,,) denotes the detector acceptance as a function of the energy fraction x and
the n-th KK boson mass M,,, and is extracted using the same interpolation procedure employed
in the 4D case.

4.3. MuSIC: Muon Synchrotron Ion Collider

The Muon Synchrotron Ion Collider (MuSIC) is a proposed high-energy muon-proton collider
designed to explore physics beyond the SM, particularly in the muon sector [43, 46]. It builds
upon existing infrastructure at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and has been envisioned
as a successor to the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) following its projected completion in the 2040s.
In addition to probing new regimes of deep inelastic scattering in nuclear physics, MuSIC offers a
promising opportunity to investigate rare muon processes, precision measurements, and the origin
of the muon anomalous magnetic moment (g — 2),,.

We focus on a similar scenario that the baseline configuration of MuSIC assumes a centre-of-
mass energy of \/s = 8.9 TeV and an integrated luminosity of L; = 2000 fb" [123]. One compelling
physics target is the search for light muon-philic vector bosons Z’, which may couple to L,, — L,,
and decay visibly to a muon pair. The Z’ boson can be produced in muon-nucleus collisions via a
bremsstrahlung-like process:

pw A(Au) 3 ww A(Au) Z', Za opt,

where a high-energy muon interacts with a stationary gold (Au) nucleus as a target [123].

In the 4D case, the number of observable events from displaced vertex signatures is given
by [123],
dy dn r( i Me ) €det P (min; twas) ) ( .6)

Nesgas = Ly / dy dn

14
where y and 77 are the Lorentz boost factor and the pseudorapidity of Z’ in the lab frame, respec-
tively. The relations and the kinematically allowed domains have been given by Eq. (3.18) and
Eq. (3.19), respectively. Note that the differential production cross section in (y,7) coordinates is
expressed as

do 7 6 do
= — sechn sin @ ———__,
dy dn = tt dx dcos 6”
with 2 = ymz:/E9 and 6 = sin“!(sechy). Refer to Eq. (3.2) for doZ’,,/ (dx dcos 6).
The detection efficiency is assumed to be €ge, = 0.86 for the dimuon channel [124]. Since the
measurement of Z’ — y~p* is made by a displaced detector far from the target, we should take
into account the reduction of the signals due to the decay of Z’ during the propagation. The decay
probability density is modelled as [123]:
o—/ez x
e . y
P(é) = ——.,, with ly ==,
Sn
where Tz is the total decay width of a static Z’ and the boost factor y describes the lifetime
dilation for observers in the lab frame. The probability that the Z’ boson decays within the
fiducial volume of interest, denoted by P(lmin, max), is obtained by integrating Eq. (4.8) as

(4.7)

(4.8)

P(Cminy Emax) ?= | dtP(0), (4.9)
with the minimum distance min = 1mm and the maximum distance fax = 30m, corresponding
to the location of the downstream detector capable of reconstructing the decay products [123].
We impose a threshold of Neignai > 5 signal events to define the exclusion limit for the MuSIC
experiment [45].
In the 5D case, the vector boson Z’ originates from a tower of KK excitations 2), each
contributing to the signal. The total number of displaced dimuon events is obtained by summing
over KK modes

where the kinetic variables y and 7 should be understood as those for the vector boson wit

muon mass. We should also be careful about the corresponding decay probability P™) (Emin, lnax)«
The superscript (n) indicates that both the production cross section and decay probability are
mode-dependent. In particular, the decay length for each KK mode is

which impacts the probability P™ (mins max) for decays occurring within the detector volume.
Due to increasing masses and typically shorter lifetimes of higher KK modes, only a subset of
modes contributes appreciably within the experimental geometry.

4.4 Future High-Energy Muon Beam Dump Experiment

A high-energy muon beam dump setup provides a cost-effective and complementary strategy for
probing weakly coupled new physics, particularly in regimes that may be inaccessible at high-
luminosity colliders [45, 95]. In this configuration, a 1.5 TeV muon beam is directed onto a dense,

15
thick target such as water [45]. This enhances the probability of producing new light mediators
like the Z’ boson via a bremsstrahlung-like process. These mediators can travel downstream before
decaying into visible particles, which are subsequently detected by a spectrometer system placed
after the shielding. The signal process is

pe A(H20) > po A(HQ0) 2’, 2! 3 ppt,

where the target is made of water (HO) [45].
For the 4D scenario, the number of signal events along the beamline is given by [45]

where N,, = 10” is the total number of muons incident on the target [45], the quantity mp = A/No
represents the mass of a target atom, with A being the atomic mass number and No Avogadro’s
number, while p (= 0.997 g/cm?) is the target density of H2O [111]. See Eq. (4.8) for the definition
of La.
Like the MuSIC experiment, the signal part Z’ + j~y* is measured by a displaced detec-
or. We adopt the specific form of the decay probability for this experimental setup as discussed
in [45]. The lengths Liar, Lsn, and Lace correspond to the target, shielding, and decay regions,
respectively. For numerical analysis, we adopt benchmark values Lia, = 10m, Le, = 10m, and
Laec = 100m [45]. We impose a threshold of Ngignal > 5 signal events to define the exclusion limit
for this experiment [45]. In this regime, radiative energy losses are assumed to be negligible in this
setup, allowing the energy distribution function to be treated as sharply peaked around the initial
muon energy.
In the case of the 5D extension, the signal receives contributions from a tower of KK modes
Z'., The total number of observable signal events in this scenario is modified accordingly

5 Results

We report our results, illustrating the exclusion sensitivity of NA64,,, M®, MuSIC, and a forthcom-
ing muon beam dump experiment to the U(1)r,,-1, gauge boson in 5D. The analysis is performed
for two benchmark scenarios: nKKmax = l, signifying the lowest KK excitation, and nkkmax = 5,
including the first five KK modes. We remind readers that the following four effective parame-
ters affect results, g’, mx, €4, and ysm (in addition to nKKmax). For simplicity, we introduce the
notation Ysm := Ysm/R. Here, we explicitly state that the DIS effect mentioned in Section 3.1 is
ignored in all of the following plots. For the legitimate reason for this, refer to the final paragraph
of this section.

sensitivity of various experiments for two KK mode truncations: nxKmax = 1 (Left Panel) and
NkKKmax = 5 (Right Panel). For the meaning of the vertical black dotted line in the right panel,
refer to Footnote 14. For the definitions of each exclusion limit via the beam dump experiments,

In Figure 4, The benchmarks are presented assuming €, = 0 and gy = 0.'° Note that the
details of our signal estimations in the four experiments have been propounded in Section 4, based
on the signal cross-section formulas in Section 3.4

An appreciable improvement in sensitivity is noted with the addition of KK modes. For exam-
ple, increasing nKkmax from one to five significantly enhances the exclusion reach for both NA64,,
and M3. Note that we have established that truncating the KK tower at nxkmax = 5 provides a
sufficiently precise and convergent approximation for the experimental circumstances of NA64,,,
M®; Refer to Figs. 8 and 9 in the Appendix A for details.

We will briefly summarise the information obtained from the latest results on muon (g — 2).
As a sensational announcement, the long-standing anomaly between the SM prediction and the
experimental results was resolved as a®P — a$M = 38(63) x 10-4, which is consistent within
~ 0.60 [84]. Currently, this experimental value can be used to exclude specific areas of new

on Ysm is observed.

“Regarding several minor handling points, we will comment on them below. (i) Since the beam energy in the
M® experiment is 15 GeV, it is kinematically impossible to directly produce up to the fifth KK mode when the
mxx is greater than ~ 2 GeV, corresponding to the area on the right separated by the vertical dotted line in the
right panel of Fig. 4. In this region, we consider the contribution of all kinematically possible KK vector bosons
with nxx less than five; (ii) As introduced in Section 2, in calculating the mixing of the fields, we performed an
expansion using the epsilon parameter and retained only the lowest-order term. However, this is not necessarily
justified when the mass of a given unperturbed KK particle approaches the mass of the Z boson sufficiently closely.

enm’
(see Eqs. (2.14) to (2.16)). To avoid the catastrophe, in the calculations with «4 4 0 of the MuSIC and the future
beam dump, we will impose the following ad hoc cutoffs for the KK modes, M; < 45 GeV (i = 1,2,3,4,5). Via the
mode-by-mode reaches for €, = 0 (up to the 5th mode) in Fig. 5, namely mxx < 10GeV in MuSIC and the future
muon beam dump, the introduction of the above ad hoc cutoffs may change the results very little.

If «4 £ 0, this failure is materialised in calculations arising from the factor ( ), which manifests in mixing

physics coupled with muons. As shown in Fig. 4, it is notable that the constraint on our scenario
is comparable to the current experimental constraint from NA64,,. Note that we used the formula
or evaluating KK gauge boson contributions to the muon (g — 2) available in Section 2.4 of [85].

The most phenomenologically interesting prospect arises from the future observation of massive
gauge boson decays to muon pairs at a displaced detector in upcoming experiments, MuSIC and a
orthcoming muon beam dump experiment. These effective search regions are determined by the
ifetimes of massive gauge bosons, where feebly interacting light massive particles near ~ 1 GeV
are the primary targets for exploration.
With improved sensitivity, compared to the single-mode case, adding more KK modes to the
MuSIC experiment creates a fascinating region in the parameter space. The enhancement can be
attributed to the configuration of the mode functions f,,, which gain significance with the inclusion
of additional KK modes (see Ref. [85] for further information). Conversely, in the forthcoming
muon beam dump experiment, the incorporation of elevated KK modes does not result in any
significant enhancement in sensitivity. This difference can be explained by focusing on the future
charted domains by individual KK modes. In Fig. 5, we figure out the ‘Nsignai > 5’ regions for the
first five KK modes separately.
In the experimental setup of the future muon beam dump experiment, as shown in the right
panel of Fig. 5, the domain of the (¢ + 1)-mode is located just inside of that of the i-mode (i =
1,2,3,4). Therefore, considering the general property that the cross section for generating the
high KK mode is suppressed compared to that for the low KK mode, it is most reasonable that
the restriction from the first mode alone provides a good approximation, as shown in Fig. 4.

In contrast, in the MuSIC experiment setup, the initial muon beam energy is extremely high
(= 8.9TeV), so the production cross sections for high KK modes do not decrease so rapidly.
Furthermore, this high initial energy may enable clear identification of differences in the lifetimes
of KK modes. These observations can be clearly discerned from the left panel of Fig. 5. Therefore,
in the MuSIC experiment, a significant increase in the searchable region based on the existence of
multiple KK modes is clearly observable.

Moreover, the fact that the muon pair signal allows the parent particle’s mass to be recon-
structed holds significant importance in our scenario. In the overlapping regions of the searchable

respectively. Here, we follow the same colour conventions as those for Fig. 4. The meaning of ‘upto

validity range. Refer to Footnote 14 for details.

areas for each mode in Fig. 5, the existence of multiple massive gauge bosons with different masses
can be confirmed from the reconstruction of muon pair signals after accumulating the targeted
amount of data. Therefore, muon pair signal surveys using displaced detectors provide a powerful
tool for directly distinguishing whether the U(1)z,,-1, interaction originates in five dimensions or
in four dimensions.

Finally, we discuss future exploration limits when the typical size of kinetic mixing is nonzero.
Figure 6 provides the future expected reaches for yg = 0 under the presence of nonzero kinetic
mixing parameter, with €, = 10-4 (Left column), €, = 107° (Centre column), and 4 = 10~® (Right
column), respectively. As can be seen immediately from the figure, there is an expansion of the
searchable region, particularly where g’ is small. This can be easily understood because a new
contribution is added to the effective coupling.!®

15 We provide a comment on why the constraint via the future muon dump experiment becomes tiny for 4 = 1074
in Fig. 6. Under the ‘sizable’ value of €4, each KK mode couples with SM particles quite strongly and tends to decay
immediately. So, most of the KK vector bosons evanesce in the large decay volume before reaching the displaced
detector. In the case of MuSIC, the size of the decay volume is relatively small, and still, the emitted KK particles
are able to reach the detector region.

19
It is noteworthy that for each specific «4 coordination, a narrow region of g’ that cannot be
probed has been reported. This phenomenon, reported in a previous paper for EvES [85], is
thought to be realised by the contributions from 4 and g’ coincidentally cancelling each other out.
What has become clear here is that muon beam dump experiments also possess strong detection
capabilities for even minute g’ values at tiny but nonzero e€4.

Here, we will discuss the contribution of VVCS mentioned at the end of Section 3.1. As
stated in paper [112], when all interactions are provided by kinetic mixing, the VVCS contributes
an additional ~ 10%, if the initial charged lepton energy is significantly greater than the mass
of a massive gauge boson. When g’ is significantly larger than €4, we can conclude that this
contribution is negligible. Conversely, when €4 is significantly larger than g’, this contribution
cannot necessarily be ignored; however, when the incident lepton’s energy is sufficiently high, this
contribution amounts to about 10%. This parameter region, currently under investigation €4 > 9’,
is part of the focus of the MuSIC and the future muon beam dump experiments. However, since
the initial muon beam energies in these two experiments are extremely high, exceeding 1 TeV, the
application of the aforementioned excess estimate is justified. Therefore, it can be concluded that
the estimation of the searchable region in Fig. 6 is sufficiently accurate, under the outlook that a
subleading extra contribution of approximately 10% in the signal cross section can be neglected.

Also, we provide a comment on the DIS-active domain. Based on the criterion in Eq. (3.13),
in each experiment, the vector bosons in mz = 18GeV (NA64,), mz 2 6GeV (M?*), mz =
133 GeV (MuSIC), mz 2 55GeV (Future Muon Beam Dump) reaches the DIS-active domain,
and additional gains can entre into the picture. Up to the 5th KK mode, the above conditions can
be rephrased in the sense of mxx as MK = 2GeV (NA64,,), MKK = 0.7 GeV (M3), mx 2 15 GeV
(MuSIC), mxx 2 6 GeV (Future Muon Beam Dump), respectively. In this particular domain, we
believe we are underestimating the constraints and predictions in the experiments. However, as
can be seen from Figs. 4 and 5 (cf. Fig. 6), in each experiment, this only applies near the heavier
boundary of the corresponding exclusion limits. Therefore, within the scope discussed in this
manuscript, it can be concluded that additional signals from deep-inelastic scattering can appear
significantly only at the very edge of the probeable region, affecting only a small fraction of the
total area, and thus have little effect on the global shapes of the exclusion limits.

6 Conclusions

In this paper, we have investigated how to survey the nature of the 5D U(1),,,-1, interactions
in present and future muon dump experiments, namely, NA64,,, M®, MuSIC, and a future muon
dump experiment. These experiments fall into two categories: the first two can probe processes
where feebly interacting massive particles go into invisible channels, while the latter two can probe
processes where they go into muon pairs. These two types of experiments are complementary in
that they allow exploration of different parameter regions of a model. In our scenario, the presence
of multiple massive gauge bosons as KK particles leads to a tendency for more signals to appear
compared to the corresponding four-dimensional one. In particular, the decay process into muon
pairs enables mass reconstruction of the parent particle, making it possible to directly demonstrate
the existence of multiple KK particles in at least some parameter regions. This provides clear evi-
dence that the origin of the U(1)z,,-1, interaction lies in five dimensions. Furthermore, the muon
(g — 2) value, which is now consistent with the SM, can be used to exclude specific parameter
regions for new particles interacting with muons. We have further discussed the non-trivial effects
arising from kinetic mixing (which many other related studies have not addressed). As succinctly

20
illustrated in Figure 6, kinetic mixing produces interesting effects, such as the extension of restric-
tions to regions with small g’ values and the disappearance of certain restricted areas due to the
cancellation of impacts between g’ and €4.

The motivation to explain the (once-observed) muon (g — 2) anomaly has since been lost, but
as briefly mentioned in the introduction, the U(1)z,,-1, interaction is still considered a meaningful
interaction. For example, it is phenomenologically interesting to investigate the role of the mediator
for thermal WIMP dark matter at the MeV and GeV mass scales in the current five-dimensional
case. Furthermore, it is a significant issue to discuss the parameter regions that can explain the
experimental results of the Hubble tension in the case of 5D U(1)z,,-1,, a8 well as those that can be
ruled out due to strong inconsistencies. Furthermore, future muon collider experiments currently
in planning can also impose constraints on KK gauge bosons, which are light and interact very
weakly with muons [125].
