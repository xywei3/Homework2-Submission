Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystals offer strong control over the propagation
of light through their bands. Theoretical methods for computing the band structure in 2D are
well-established and fast because 2D photonic crystals are homogeneous in the third dimension.
Experimental verification is scarce, however, especially in the telecom range, because real
photonic crystals and experimental methods inherently cannot be homogeneous in the third
dimension. In this work, we report momentum-resolved reflectivity measurements on photonic
crystals that are periodic in two dimensions and homogeneous over a thickness of 5 pm. Using
Fourier spectroscopy, we carefully select wave vectors in the 2D plane of periodicity of the
photonic crystal. Our experiments agree excellently with 2D band structure calculations and
with 2D finite-difference time-domain simulations, confirming that our experimental methods
truly pertain to nanophotonics in 2D. Our results provide a robust bridge between theory and
experiment, and our techniques can be readily extended to other 2D structures, including those
with functional defects.

1. Introduction

Photonic crystals are complex nanophotonic structures with a periodic refractive index n(r) that
enable control over the propagation and emission of light [1,2]. Due to their periodicity on
the scale of the wavelength of light, photonic crystals exhibit Bloch modes with unique optical
properties, such as slow light or the opportunity for photonic gaps [3-6]; properties that are
often complex to study. Whereas 3D photonic crystals have a periodic refractive index in three
dimensions, 2D photonic crystals are periodic in two dimensions (x, y) and homogeneous in
the third (z). Still, 2D photonic crystals pertain to optical properties of photonic crystals like
bands, band gaps, and slow light. In addition, the polarizations of light in 2D structures can
be separated as opposed to 3D, making the complex properties of photonic crystals easier to
understand. Therefore, photonic crystals are often studied theoretically in 2D [7-9].

Experimentally probing the modes of 2D photonic crystals to compare with 2D theory
is remarkably complex because the third dimension of the samples should be effectively
homogeneous. One approach is to use long wavelengths and a large lattice parameter, making
the manufacturing of structures that are homogeneous over a large Az of 100m or more
possible [10-13]. However, optical techniques are challenging when using the required long
wavelengths, and the accompanying large focus spot readily obscures interesting local features
such as intentional and unintentional lattice defects. Furthermore, a more accessible approach that
functions in the telecom range would strongly support integration with present and anticipated
uses of photonic crystals.

Fourier imaging is a tool for resolving the wave vector k dependence of optical reflection [14-17].
Contrary to standard angle-resolved reflectivity measurements, many wave vectors k from the
high numerical aperture (NA) objective are examined simultaneously. The focus spot is small so
the reflectivity is only probed locally. Fourier imaging and standard angle-resolved imaging have
been applied to measure the reflectivity of 2D photonic slab waveguides, probing the bands from

the z direction [18-21]. However, slab waveguides are not captured by 2D theory because they
are not homogeneous in z [6,22,23]. In addition, the 2D in-plane modes with k, = 0 cannot
be probed from the z direction. Moreover, mode excitation effects at a 2D air-crystal interface
cannot be studied either in this configuration, while many complex effects involving, for example,
symmetry and group velocity often occur at this interface [1,7—9].

Therefore, we here present momentum-resolved reflectivity measurements of 2D photonic
crystals, periodic in x and y, and homogeneous for a range Az = 5 ym, see Fig. 1. We probe the
crystals with a small focus spot using Fourier spectroscopy, such that our thin 2D photonic crystal
is described by purely 2D theory. Our experimental dataset contains a wealth of information,
clearly displaying the dispersion of 2D Bloch modes in the reflectivity spectra. This information
can be used to further understand the properties of real photonic crystals and the intricacies at
air-crystal interfaces. Furthermore, we validate our experiments with 2D momentum-resolved
finite-difference time-domain simulations and photonic band calculations with symmetry analysis.
Our results establish Fourier spectroscopy as an accurate and efficient tool for studying 2D
photonic systems, excellent for uniting theory and experiment.

2. Methods
2.1. Samples

Our periodic 2D photonic crystals shown in Fig. | consist of air pores in silicon. The nanostructures
are created from high-purity silicon wafers with a chromium etch mask with a centered rectangular
lattice with lattice parameters (a,c) where a = 680 nm and c = a/V2, which were previously
prepared in our group [24]. The samples are etched using deep reactive-ion etching (SPTS

Fig. 2. Schematic of the setup. A plane wave is incident on the back focal plane (BFP)
of the objective (OBJ), which focuses the light onto the 2D photonic crystal. The
objective also collects reflected light. The back focal plane is imaged onto a camera, of
which only light in the plane of the 2D sample is selected (red dashed line). The s- and
-polarizations are defined at the right. The illustration is not to scale.

Pegasus) using the method detailed by Goodwin er al. [25]. After etching, the pores are L =
5 um deep, have a diameter d = 244 + 20nm. Importantly, each pore is close to identical and
almost perfectly cylindrical.

For transmission experiments, it is necessary to have a sample that is sufficiently thin in the x
direction for a significant fraction of the light to be transmitted. To this end, a Focused lon Beam
(FIB) was used to lift out a slab of 2D photonic crystal. A protective layer of carbon was applied
to the slab to prevent surface damage from the ion beam, and the slab was welded to a copper
lift-out grid (Omniprobe) using carbon. The slab was thinned front and back at 30 kV and 90 pA,
resulting in a slab-shaped sample with a thickness of L = 2.65 + 0.35 ym = 5.5c. Due to the FIB
milling, the pores extend into curtains (see Fig. 1), which are located below the photonic crystal
and are only present at the surfaces. Experiments are repeated using a different photonic crystal
from another wafer, yielding similar results.

2.2. Optical methods

We use the momentum-resolved setup shown in Fig. 2, which employs Fourier spectroscopy [17,
26]. Plane waves with tunable wavelengths 2 between 900 and 1650 nm and a bandwidth Ad =
0.6 nm are incident on the back focal plane of a 100x objective with a numerical aperture NA
= 0.85. A half-wave plate sets the polarization to s- or p-polarized light, where the electric
field points in the y- or z-direction, respectively. The objective focuses the light to a spot with a
diameter FWHM (full width at half maximum) of dy < 2 ym and picks up the reflected light
in backscattering geometry. The back focal plane is imaged onto an InGaAs camera (Photonic
Sciences). From our optical measurements, we obtain a 3D data set consisting of intensity as a
function of the wavenumber / (= 1/A), and wave vector components k, and k,, see Fig. 2. To
calibrate the reflectivity in percentage points, the intensity collected from the sample is divided
by the intensity reflected on a gold mirror assuming a reflectivity of Ray = 96 %.

We manage to measure reflectivity in the 2D (x,y) plane of periodicity as follows: Incident
wave vectors with an = 0, i.e., in the 2D plane of periodicity, are reflected toward any k@" and
Ken = ky depending on the 2D structure, but they remain in the 2D plane because n(r) does not
depend on z. Likewise, incident out-of-plane wave vectors with Ke # Oare diffracted to outgoing
out-of-plane wave vectors with kgf = ke # 0. Therefore, from the 3D momentum-resolved
reflectivity, we select wave vectors with kre = 0 to obtain the 2D momentum-resolved reflectivity.
We probe the intensity at particular reflected wave vectors k"*" = k relative to that on a gold

mirror. It is possible to obtain more than 100 % reflectivity at a particular k if multiple k” are
diffracted toward the same k, i.e., when incident light is redirected. However, the reflectivity at a
single wavenumber integrated over all k is bounded to 100 %.

2.3. Band calculations

For our calculations, we use a = 680 nm, d = 244 nm, ngj = V12.1, and the primitive unit vectors
of the centered rectangular lattice. We will first estimate which Bragg plane primarily determines
the reflectivity in our experimental spectral detection regime centered around A, = 1300nm
(wavenumber 7 = 7690cm7'). According to first-order Bragg reflection for normal incidence
A = 2ndz, where dz is the spacing of lattice planes. Given A, = 1300 nm and volumetric average
refractive index nayg = 2.77, we find dg = 235nm = c/2 = 240 nm. Therefore, we estimate that
we primarily probe the bands with k-vectors on the hk = 11 Bragg plane. We calculate the bands
along this Bragg plane by the open-source package MIT Photonic Bands (MPB) [27].

Incident waves can excite Bloch modes. If a Bloch mode is excited, the reflectivity is expected
to be low, and conversely, if no Bloch mode is excited, the reflectivity is high. Therefore, in our
experiments, we infer the excitation of Bloch modes from the absence of reflected light.

Due to the periodic surface, diffraction orders are possible, where AP = kee + 12, where
1 € Z, see Fig. 3(a). To excite a Bloch mode, the incident wave must have the same wavenumber
as the Bloch mode of the photonic crystal, vin = pphe and a wave vector ke = gphe + mz, where
where m € Z [8], illustrated in Fig. 3(b). In addition, the symmetry properties must match
as discussed further [7], and the phase velocity of the Bloch modes must not point toward the
surface [9]. The phase velocity is not considered here because it requires a detailed investigation
using equifrequency surfaces; therefore, we may calculate a few additional modes that we cannot
excite. The amplitudes of reflected and excited waves are determined by the interface, and are
computed later in Sec. 2.4.

Non-specularly reflected diffraction orders such as Krell in Fig. 3(a) may interfere with the
specularly reflected order k"", which would complicate data analysis. We calculate at which
wavenumbers higher orders are collected by the objective to show that such interference only
occurs in a small portion of our collected momentum-resolved reflectivity spectra: collection of
higher diffraction orders occurs soonest when ki" and a overlap and coincide with the maximum
collected ky of the objective, i.e., when ke = (NA)ko = an which occurs at wavenumber 7 >
8650cm~!. For normal modes (kin = 0), higher orders may interfere only when 7 > 17300cm~!,
far outside our detection regime. Therefore, the calculated bands with wavenumbers Veale and
off-axis wave vector Rote can be directly plotted onto the experimentally obtained wavenumber
versus off-axis wave vector graphs.
As mentioned, for an incident wave to excite a Bloch mode (see Fig. 3(b)), their symmetry
properties must match [7,28]. One symmetry property is polarization, which is separable for 2D
structures. The most important direction for reflectivity is the direction normal to the sample,
k = k,&. The Bloch modes with kP* = APheg have other symmetry in addition to polarization,
namely whether they are symmetric or antisymmetric for a mirror flip in the y direction, mo.
As s-polarized (p-polarized) plane waves are antisymmetric (symmetric) for mo, they can only
excite antisymmetric (symmetric) Bloch modes. Although the mo; mirror flip only holds exactly
at kphe = Keheg. the mo, flip property is likely to remain dominant for off-axis modes with
kphe Keheg Therefore, only those states with symmetry properties that are excited by plane
waves at ki" = ki"& are shown. These symmetry-selected bands are expected to describe the most
prominent features of the measured momentum-resolved reflectivity.

2.4. Finite-difference time-domain simulations

We simulate the momentum-resolved reflectivity of the 2D crystal and — as a reference — an
empty space in the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) using the package MEEP [29]. An
s- or p-polarized Gaussian pulse with a frequency centered around ¥, = 7500cm™! with full
width at half maximum A¥,,, = 5000cm™! is incident on a 2D sample. The fields are recorded
at a distance 0.25 ym from the surface and Fourier transformed in time and space to obtain the
momentum-resolved amplitudes F {Asampic} and F {Aempty}. The reflectivity as a function of
wavenumber ¥ and off-axis wave vector ky is calculated via [30]

|F {Acampte} — F{Aempry}|-

Reampte(¥, ky) = 100% ;
|F Acmpty}|

(1)

The crystal has a size of 20 x 6 rectangular unit cells, corresponding to 13.6 x 2.88 ym?. To
increase the resolution and source size, we pad the structure with 10 1m free space in both
+y directions. The maximum ky that we can simulate is then 4.5 m7! using the default
GaussianBeam2DSource from MEEP.

3. Results
3.1. Experiments & band calculations

Momentum-resolved reflectivity spectra measured on the 2D crystal are shown in Fig. 4(a). We
observe clear features such as deep troughs and high plateaus in the spectra ranging from about
10 to 100 % percent reflectivity. The features are sharp in wavenumber /, going from high to low
reflectivity in a few tens of cm~!. In addition, we observe that the reflectivity is symmetric about
ky = 0, which is expected given the symmetry of the sample, the excellent etch quality, and the
precisely cut interface plane.

To interpret the features in the reflectivity, we calculate bands (cyan-dashed in Fig. 4(a)) of
this photonic crystal for k-vectors on the 11 Bragg plane. The bands are selected on symmetry
to be excitable with s- or p-polarized plane waves. The sharpest features in the measured
reflectivity agree well with the calculated bands: Firstly, the s-polarized band at 8700 cm7! and
the p-polarized band at 8100cm™! indicate the edge of a stop gap, with high reflectivity below
and low reflectivity above this band. Secondly, the s-polarized band starting at 7000 cm=! and
the p-polarized band at 6800cm~! at ky = 0 indicate troughs inside the high reflectivity where
the incident waves excite Bloch modes and therefore do not reflect. The latter band only shows a
shallow trough that disappears quickly with increasing |ky|s potentially, the symmetry changes
when moving off the axis.

Above 9000cm™!, the bands calculated on the 11 Bragg plane disagree with the measured
reflectivity. In addition, the bands do not explain many other features, such as the s-polarized

expand the theoretical search and selection of bands by considering bands calculated at other
k-vectors, for example, on other Bragg planes; and by considering equifrequency surfaces and
the group velocity of Bloch modes to check if particular bands cannot be excited. However,
overall, the bands calculated using 2D theory agree very well with the experiments, showing that
the measurements probe 2D nanophotonics.

3.2. Simulations

To further prove that we measure only in-plane reflectivity, we simulate momentum-resolved
reflectivity spectra using 2D FDTD in Fig. 4(b). The simulated spectra exhibit sharp features
with reflectivity values ranging from near 0 to 120 % and are symmetric about ky = 0.

We again compare the results to the symmetry-selected bands (cyan dashed) calculated at
the 11 Bragg plane. The bands, which are calculated for an infinite photonic crystal, agree
well with troughs inside the simulated reflectivity of the finite structure, but — similar to the

experiment — only for wavenumbers below 9000 cm~!. Minor discrepancies occur because the
band calculations consider an infinite structure while the simulations consider a finite width,
L=6ce.

The simulated 2D reflectivity of Fig. 4(b) agrees very well with the measured effectively 2D
experiment of Fig. 4(a). Around the calculated bands below 9000cm™!, the simulations and
experiments show the same troughs and steps in reflectivity. Besides the reflectivity around
the bands, for s-polarized light, experiment and simulation both show upward curving troughs
around 6500cm~!, and a low-reflectivity triangle around 9500 cm7!. In addition, p-polarized
features such as the X-shape near 9700 cm7! with the horizontal troughs below and the small
troughs inside the high reflectivity at 8000 cm~! match as well.

To quantitatively compare the simulations to the experiments in more detail, we take a cross
section through the momentum-resolved spectra around ky = 0 averaged over wavevectors
ky/|k| < 0.1 in Fig. 5. We observe that the reflectivities obtained in the experiments and
simulations both steeply decrease from a high to a low plateau around ¥ = 7900cm~! for
p-polarized light and around 7 = 8600cm™! for s-polarized light. The simulated reflectivity
has deeper troughs than in the experiment: the first troughs in the low plateaus reach less than
1 % reflectivity in the simulations but 14 % in the experiments. The simulated features are more
extreme likely because no manufacturing defects are considered in the simulations. Specifically,
due to manufacturing defects such as splinters in the pores, a varying pore diameter with z, and
surface roughness, the features soften and smooth out. We refer to Ref. [31] for a thorough
discussion on the impact of fabrication defects on the reflectivity of 2D photonic crystals.

In the momentum-resolved reflectivity spectra of Fig. 4(b), we also observe variations in the
simulated reflectivity at high spatial frequencies, for example, for p-polarized reflectivity at 7 <
8000cm~!, while the reflectivity is much smoother in the experiment. We attribute the variations
to the effects of the Fourier transform over a finite domain and an imperfect light source in the
simulation. While the precise reflectivity values of the experiments and simulations slightly vary
due to fabrication defects, overall the features that we observe agree very well, again confirming
that our experimental methods are rigorous.

4. Conclusion

We have successfully measured the momentum-resolved reflectivity of a 2D photonic crystal in
its plane of periodicity in the near-infrared regime. The reflectivity corresponds excellently to
2D band calculations and 2D momentum-resolved finite-difference time-domain simulations,
proving that the experiments only probe wave vectors in the 2D periodic plane. The results are
exciting because photonic crystals and band structures are often studied theoretically in 2D, but
to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to probe them experimentally in the near-infrared
spectral regime around A = 1550nm. Therefore, we believe our results can be used to further
understand complex phenomena in the field of photonic crystals, such as the roles of symmetry
and group velocity of the incident and excited waves in the percentage of light that is reflected
or transmitted. The optical procedure is readily applicable to other 2D structures, such as 2D
quasicrystals, as well as 3D structures, including 3D photonic crystals, and structures with
intentional and unintentional defects.
