Though highly impacting our lives, rotating turbulent flows are not well understood. These
anisotropic three-dimensional disordered flows are governed by different nonlinear processes, each of
which can be dominant in a different range of parameters. More than 20 years ago, Galtier used weak
wave turbulence theory (WTT) to derive explicit predictions for the energy spectrum of rotating
turbulence. The spectrum is an outcome of forward energy transfer by inertial waves, the linear
modes of rotating fluid systems. This spectrum has not yet been observed in freely evolving flows. In
this work, we show that the predicted WTT field does exist in steady rotating turbulence, alongside
with the more energetic quasi two-dimensional turbulent field. By removing the 2D component
from the steady state velocity field, we show that the remainder three-dimensional field consists
of inertial waves and exactly obeys WTT predictions. Our analysis verifies the dependence of the
energy spectrum on all four relevant parameters and provides limits, beyond which WTT predictions
fail. These results provide a solid basis for new theoretical and experimental works focused on the
coexistence of the quasi 2D field and the inertial waves field and on their interactions.

Introduction Rapid rotation has competing effects on
turbulent flows. On the one hand, it excites and sup-
port the propagation of inertial waves, helical three-
dimensional (3D) waves that are driven by Coriolis accel-
eration [1-3]. Thus, as a nonlinear wavy system, rotating
urbulence might be govern by wave interactions, sug-
gesting that WTT should describe the statistics of such
ows.

On the other hand, experiments and simulations in-
dicate that as the rate of rotation increases, the flow
field becomes progressively more confined to the plane

In this

kinetic energy is contained in the quasi-2D part of the
ow.

In view of these observations, it has not been clear
whether wave turbulence cascade exists in rotating flows.
Does the presence of energetic quasi-2D turbulence,
which is dominated by inverse energy cascade preclude
the wave turbulent cascade of inertial waves? Statistics
similar to Galtier’s spectrum were measured in simula-
tions, only when modified (local) dynamics was used [12
or as an inverse cascade [13, 14]. In recent experiments
[15], and simulations [16], parts of the Galtier spectrum
were observed. However, this observation was made in
turbulence where the quasi-2D flow was suppressed, and
so far the Galtier spectrum has not been measured in
freely evolving rotating turbulence.

In this work, we present a set of experiments in which
we decompose the rotating turbulent flow into its 2D and
3D components. Using this decomposition, we show tha‘
steady state rotating turbulence consists of the 3D WTT
flow predicted by Galtier, coexists alongside the previ-
ously observed quasi-2D turbulent field. While the latter

is dominant on large scales, the WTT flow is dominant
on small scales, driving a forward energy cascade. By
analyzing the 3D component of the flow, we confirm the
full scaling of the Galtier spectrum, i.e., its dependence
on all relevant parameters (defined below).

Theoretical background Rotating turbulent flows are
described in the rotating frame by the rotating Navier-
Stokes equation. They are characterized by two dimen-
sionless numbers: the Reynolds number (Re) and the
Rossby number (Ro). The Reynolds number is a mea-
sure of the ratio of inertial to viscous forces in a fluid
flow, and is defined as Re = UL/v, where U is a charac-
teristic velocity, L is a characteristic length, and v is the
kinematic viscosity of the fluid. The Rossby number is a
measure of the ratio of inertial to Coriolis forces and is
defined as Ro = U/(2QL), where 2 is the angular veloc-
ity of the system. In rotating turbulence, the Reynolds
number is large, Re >> 1, while the Rossby number is
small, Ro < 1.

Inertial waves propagate in rapidly rotating incom-
pressible fluids. These waves are small-amplitude solu-
tions to the rotating Navier-Stokes equation, arising from
the interplay between inertia and the Coriolis accelera-
tion [17]. We choose the vertical z direction along the
axis of rotation, i.e., Q = QZ. The amplitude of plane
inertial waves is proportional to exp|i(wt — k-r)| where
w and k are the wave frequency and wave vector, respec-
tively, that satisfy the anisotropic dispersion relation

w/2Q = +cos(0 (1)

where 6@ is the angle between the wave vector k and the
rotation axis Z and w/2Q is the normalized frequency.
Wave turbulence theory (WTT) addresses the statisti-
cal properties of weakly nonlinear ensembles of waves in
large domains (2, 18-21]. The theory provides a rigorous
analytical framework to derive quantitative predictions
for the wave energy spectrum. WTT has been valuable

(left), its vertical average v2p (center), and the residual field v3p (right), measured in a cubic domain in an experiment with
Re & 3000 and Ro * 0.01. The full flow field is turbulent and anisotropic, exhibiting structures on a wide range of horizontal
scales, and long-range vertical correlations. The 2D field is dominated by disordered, large-scale vortex-like structures that
persist for many rotation periods. The 3D field consists of small scales in three dimensions, but with clear anisotropy, showing

longer vertical correlation than in the horizontal directions.

in understanding energy transfers in systems such as cap-
illary waves [22-24] and bending waves in thin elastic
plates [25-28]. In the case of rotating turbulence, several
theoretical studies have extended WTT to predict the
anisotropic energy distribution of inertial waves [5, 18-
20, 29].

Using WTT formalism, Galtier [29, 30] directly calcu-
lated that weak interactions of inertial waves can lead to
a steady turbulent state. The theory predicts a forward
weak wave turbulence cascade with an anisotropic energy
spectrum:

E(kp, ke) ~ Ve bz 5/2 RT Y?, (2)

In this expression, € denotes the energy injection rate,
while k, and k, are magnitudes of the vertical and hor-
izontal projections of k. The spectrum (2) was derived
under the assumption that k, < k,. It is an open ques-
tion whether the assumptions of WTT can be realized in
freely evolving rotating turbulence, i.e., in the presence
of the energetic quasi 2D flow, or whether wave turbu-
lence can only manifest under constrained or controlled
conditions [12, 15, 16, 31].

Experimental System We use a rotating plexiglass
cylindrical tank of 80 cm diameter and 90 cm height,

placed on a rotating table (Q = —0Z, with a maximum
rotation rate of 12.6rad/s). The tank is filled with water
and covered with a transparent flat lid. Energy is injected
at the bottom of the tank by circulating water through
an array of outlets and inlets. The energy injection is
concentrated at a central wavelength 2n/kinj, which is a
decreasing function of 9 (see [32]) down to ~ 5cm at
high rotation rates. In the set of measurements shown,
kinj is in the range 0.8 rad/em < kinj < 1.8 rad/cm. Us-
ing a vertically scanning horizontal laser sheet, we per-
form a sweeping particle image velocimetry, and mea-
sure the horizontal velocity field, v1 (x,y, z,t), imside
a ~ 21 x 21 x 24 cm® volume in the interior of the
tank, at a rate (for full volumes) of 21.4 Hz; the spa-
tial resolution is 0.22 cm horizontally and 0.7 cm ver-
tically. In each experiment, the system is brought to
steady state by running it for ~ 300s with an angu-
lar speed 9.5 rad/s < Q < 12.5 rad/s and a constant
energy injection rate, corresponding to turbulent flows
with Reynolds numbers 0.006 < Ro < 0.02 and Rossby
numbers 500 < Re < 3500.

Results A snapshot of the energy density E =
(1/2) (\v(r, t)|?) is shown in figure 1(a). This disordered
energy distribution consists of a broad range of scales,
both larger and smaller than the injection scale. We de-
compose the flow field v into two components: the first
is the vertically averaged field, vp:

dz is the vertical spacing between measurement planes,
and Ah is the total measurement height. v2p con-
sists of large, energetic vortical structures (see Fig. 1(b),
(e)) that meander in the x,y plane (See Supplementary
Videos [33, 34]). These large-scale structures are pro-
duced by the inverse cascade of energy [4, 7, 10, 11, 35,

The second component of the velocity field is the resid-
ual v3p:

Usp(#,y,2,t) = v(2,y,2,t) —vap(a,y,t) (4)

Plotting the energy density and vorticity of this com-
ponent (Fig. 1(c), (f)) reveals that v3p varies on scales
much smaller than the scale of variation of vop. Al
though v3p varies both horizontally and vertically, the
snapshots indicate that it is anisotropic, with shorter
horizontal and longer vertical scales of variation. This
anisotropy, as well as the vertical propagation of energy
and vorticity variations, is clearly observable in a videos
of the energy and vorticity [33, 34].

The energy spectra E,(k,), (see SI [37]) of the ful
field, the 2D and 3D components, shown in Fig. 2, exhibi
two different scaling regimes. At scales larger than the
injected scales kinj, the spectrum of the 2D componen

follows a scaling of kel. This regime is generated via
the inverse cascade of energy, as previously reported [4,
7, 10, 11, 35, 36]. At these scales, the vertically averaged
v2p field dominates the spectrum, while the residual v3p
is negligible. In contrast, the smaller scales of the flow
are dominated by vgp, whose energy density scales as
kp 5/ 2 consistent with the WTT prediction for a forward
cascade [Eq. (2)].

Motivated by these observations, we examine whether
he 3D component of the flow consists of inertial waves
and whether its energy spectrum is consistent with the
full scaling of Eq. (2). The 3D velocity field was Fourier
ransformed in space and time, leading to v3p(k,w).
The corresponding 4D energy spectrum is defined as
E(k,w) = (1/2) |vsp(k,w)|?. We compute E(0,w) by
integrating E(k,w) over ¢ and small scales (relative to
he injection scale). We find that the kinetic energy is lo-
calized along the dispersion relation Eq. (1) (Fig 3). This
spectral behavior is a direct confirmation that v3p con-
sists of inertial waves. In contrast to the spectrum of the
full velocity field (see [11, 35, 38]), the residual 3D flow
does not exhibit a pileup of energy near 6 — 7/2 (corre-
sponding to very low frequencies), showing that the slow
quasi-2D modes are separated from the 3D flow field.

FIG. 2. Horizontal energy spectra: E. as a function of the
horizontally projected wave number k,. of the full velocity field
v (yellow dashed line), the vertically averaged flow v2p (blue
squares), and the residual field v3p (red triangles). Energy is
injected at ky = king © 1.8rad/cm. For ky < kinj, the energy
density is dominated by v2p which follows a Kp e/8 power law.
For ky > kinj v3p dominates and the spectra follow a ail
power law, consistent with WTT scaling (Eq. (2)).

The scaling of the energy spectrum in Eq. (2) is highly
anisotropic, and its validation requires an independent
measurement of the energy density as a function of both
k, and k,. Due to limited resolution in k,, we use the
dispersion relation [Eq. (1)] to express k, in terms of
w, for which we have excellent resolution (see SI [37]
for additional details). Rewriting the dispersion re-
lation [Eq. (1)] in terms of the normalized frequency
gives w/(20) = kz/k = kz/k,, the mixed wave vector-
frequency spectrum associated with Eq. (2) becomes

FIG. 4. Energy density E,,(k,) of the residual 3D flow, shown
as a function of the horizontally projected wavenumber k,. for
several fixed values of frequency w. At low frequencies, the
spectra follow the ky4 power law predicted by WTT, while
at higher frequencies, deviations from this scaling become ap-
parent. The inset shows the root mean square error (RMSE)
of the k,* fit as a function of w/(2Q), for six different ex-
periments. Each symbol corresponds to a different dataset.
The fit error remains low at low frequencies and rises sharply
around w/(2Q) * 0.4, indicating a breakdown of WTT pre-
dictions.

We analyze the two-dimensional spectrum E(k,,w) by
examining its behavior at fixed frequency slices E,,(k,) =
E(k,,w = const). We plot E,,(k,) for a broad frequency
range (Fig. 4). The energy spectra exhibit a ky scaling
for low frequencies, consistently with Eq. 5. As argued
above, this result is a frequency-resolved verification of
the ky, /? scaling, presented in Eq. 2. This scaling is
expected to hold only in the limit k, >> k,, correspond-
ing to small normalized frequencies w < 9. Indeed, the
spectra obtained for w ~ 2 do not match the k7* scal-
ing. We quantified the quality of the scaling for six dif-
ferent experiments, by computing the fitting error of a
k-4 power-law fit at various frequencies (Fig. 4 inset).
For all data sets, the scaling of k74 is maintained up to
w/20 ~ 0.4, above which the fit error increases sharply,
suggesting k,/k, < 0.4 as the upper bound for the range
of validity of the Galtier cascade.

By integrating the spectrum in Fig. 3 over 0, we obtain
the temporal energy spectrum E(w) of the residual 3D
flow. Figure 5 shows E(w) as a function of the normalized
frequency w/(2Q) for experiments with several rotation
rates and two different injection pressures p, correspond-
ing to different energy input rates. The frequency spec-
tra display a power-law E(w) (w/2Q) ~ A(w/2Q)-'/?,
in agreement with the WTT prediction Eq. (5).

We can further test Eq. (5) by examining the depen-
dence of the prefactor A on system parameters. Fig. 5(b)
shows E(w)Vw® for the same set of measurements as in
panel (a). After this rescaling, the data are collapsed

Each of the two lines contains data obtained at differ-
ent rotation rates, 2, and they are separated only by the
injection pressure p. This confirms the A ~ Q71/? scal-
ing. Although in our experiments we cannot accurately
determine the value of the forward energy flux €, we can
assume that it increases with the total power injected by
the pump, which scales like p?. Indeed, additional rescal-
ing of the data by p?/? leads to data collapse around a
single horizontal line (inset of Fig. 5(b)). The line is hor-
izontal in the range 0.04 < w/2Q < 0.4 (vertical dashed
lines). This completes the full verification of WTT pre-
dictions for the energy spectrum.

Conclusions There are two competing paradigms for
rapidly rotating turbulent flows. The first rests on the
observation that the rotation inhibits fluid flow parallel
to its axis, making the flow similar to 2D turbulence with
an inverse cascade of energy. The second starts from the
observation that rotating flows support the propagation
of waves, on which wave turbulence can develop; WTT
then predicts an anisotropic forwarc

Previous experiments an
vealed evidence supporting the 2D turbulence paradigm,
together with evidence that inertial waves do exist and
play a role in energy transport. The experiments pre-
sented here show that the two paradigms are not mu-
tually exclusive. Quasi-geostrophic modes transport en-
ergy to larger scales, in the form of large quasi-2D coher-
ent vortices, whereas other modes transport energy to
smaller scales. The key enabling factor for this discovery
was the decomposition of the flow into its 2D and 3D
components, providing enough resolution to observe the
forward cascade without it being swamped by the highly
energetic large scale flow.

In this manner we were able to identify for the firs
ime two distinct scaling regimes in energy spectrum o
rotating turbulence, and to verify the prediction of iner-
ial wave turbulence theory, made by Galtier more than
20 years ago. The WTT spectrum is anisotropic, and
y relating the wavenumber and frequency spectra we
were able to verify both the parallel and perpendicu-
ar scaling, as well as the parametric scaling in a wide
range of flow parameters with 10° < Re < 104, and
—10-° S$ Ro S$ 10-?. The results demonstrate conclu-
sively that an inertial wave cascade is realized in rotating
urbulent flows.

Interestingly, even though we identified the inertial
wave cascade in the 3D flow component, this anisotropic
cascade is actually carried by modes with wavevectors
hat are nearly perpendicular to the rotation axis, with
kz, < ky. This limit, which was one of the theoreti-
cal conditions of validity, agrees with the range 0.04 <
w/(2Q) ~ kz/ky S 0.4 in which we observed the Galtier
scaling in experiments.

The results presented in this work suggest a new view
on rotating turbulence. Further theoretical and experi-
mental work is needed in order to determine the interplay
between the quasi-2D and the wave components of the
flow, as well as the dynamics that govern high frequency
modes.
