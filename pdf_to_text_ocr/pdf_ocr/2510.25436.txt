eo) 1. Introduction

Most young stars, especially massive ones, form in clusters
| within dense clumps (e.g., Heyer et al. 2016), following certain
= universal physical laws, such as the initial mass function (IMF;
+ Salpeter 1955), the core mass function (CMF; Motte et al. 1998),
Y and the star formation law (Kennicutt 1998; Gao & Solomon
—~ 2004). Dense clumps are therefore believed to serve as the fun-
damental building blocks of star formation, giving rise to the key
™— physical processes that regulate it (McKee & Tan 2003; Bon-
> nell et al. 2004; Liu et al. 2025). Large surveys of dense clumps
(e.g., ATLASGAL; Schuller et al. 2009) and their embedded
proto-clusters (e.g., ALMAGAL; Molinari et al. 2025; ALMA-
QUARKS; Liu et al. 2024b) now provide an opportunity to sta-
tistically investigate the physical processes that underpin these
¢ fundamental laws of star formation. However, the lack of tracers
that can provide a linear evolutionary timescale for individual
clumps makes it difficult to constrain how these processes evolve
over time.
Fortunately, for a survey containing a large, unbiased sample
: a of sources spanning an evolutionary sequence, if one or more
S< measured parameters vary monotonically with evolution, it is
possible to use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of
these parameters as a proxy for a linear evolutionary timescale.
This technique has been applied to the infrared spectral energy
distribution (SED) slope (@) to trace the evolutionary age of pro-
toplanetary disks (Liu et al. 2024a). In the context of young star
and protocluster formation, the ATLASGAL survey (Schuller
et al. 2009) provides such an unbiased sample, where the clump
dust temperature (Tyust), Which is believed to increase with evo-
lution, may serve as a suitable monotonic parameter. The ob-
tained Tgyst-age relation can also be used to calibrate the evolu-
tionary age of other samples that may be affected by selection
biases, such as the ALMAGAL survey (Molinari et al. 2025). In
this work, we use the CDF of Tgust to linearize the evolutionary

We present a statistical framework that establishes an accelerating star formation scenario for dense clumps using ATLASGAL and
ALMAGAL samples. By employing the cumulative distribution function of dust temperature as a monotonic evolutionary indicator,
we linearize clump evolution into a normalized timescale, enabling direct comparison across different samples. The virial mass of
clumps increases exponentially with this normalized time, revealing an accelerating buildup of star-forming gas within protoclusters.
The evolution of the maximum core mass further shows that the growth timescales of protoclusters and their embedded most massive
protostars are comparable, implying a self-similar acceleration of star formation from the stellar to the protocluster scale. This unified
framework naturally reproduces the observed evolution of luminosity, the core mass function, the mass growth of the most massive
protostars, and the dense gas star formation law on clump scales, establishing a coherent picture of accelerating star formation across

trend of dense clumps and to uncover the underlying physical
laws of star formation that have remained obscured due to the
lack of reliable age indicators for interpreting the data. An expo-
nentially accelerating star formation scenario for dense clumps
is proposed.

2. Data sources

The APEX Telescope Large Area Survey of the Galaxy (AT-
LASGAL; Schuller et al. 2009; Urquhart et al. 2018) is a large-
scale, unbiased 870 jem continuum survey of the inner Galac-
tic plane, covering approximately 420 deg? within the longi-
tude range —80° < € < 60° and latitude |b] < 1.5°. The sur-
vey provides a resolution of 19.2” and a typical sensitivity of
~ 50 mJy beam=', enabling the systematic detection of dense
molecular clumps that are likely sites of high-mass star and
cluster formation. In Urquhart et al. (2018), a complete sample
of ~ 8000 clumps was compiled, with reliable radial veloci-
ties and distances determined for ~ 97% of the sources, allow-
ing the derivation of key physical parameters (mass, luminosity,
dust temperature) and classification into evolutionary subsam-
ples. The dust temperatures (Taust) of these clumps range from
7.9 to 56.1 K (see also Figure 1). Emission from the NH3 (1,1)
line was measured for ~750 clumps (about 10% of the total sam-
ple), and the virial mass of each clump was derived from the NH3
line widths, resulting in virial parameters generally smaller than
two (Urquhart et al. 2018). These data reveal statistically sig-
nificant trends: dust temperature, luminosity (L), and line width
all increase with evolutionary stage, while clump mass remains
largely independent of evolution, implying that the bulk of the
clump mass is in place before star formation begins. Notably, the
Taust distribution shows a smooth trend with no significant dis-
continuities, indicating that star formation is a continuous pro-
cess and that the observational stages do not correspond to fun-
damentally distinct physical mechanisms (Urquhart et al. 2022).

The ALMA Evolutionary study of high-mass star formation
(ALMAGAL,; Molinari et al. 2025) is a large ALMA Cycle 7
program that maps over 1000 dense clumps from the ATLAS-
GAL survey with a resolution of ~1000 au in Band 6. The sam-
ple covers distances up to 7.5 kpc, dust temperatures from ~8 to
~40 K, and spans evolutionary stages from infrared dark clouds
to Hu regions. These clumps are massive (M., 2 500 Mo) and
exhibit a wide range of luminosity-to-mass ratios (L/M) span-
ning ~4 orders of magnitude. The survey resolves the internal
substructures of clumps, enabling systematic studies of fragmen-
tation and core evolution. In the first compact-source catalog
(Coletta et al. 2025), the core mass function (CMF) is found to
evolve with time, flattening and extending toward higher masses
as clumps progress through their evolutionary stages (as traced
by L/M or Taust). This result indicates that the CMF builds up
gradually, consistent with a clump-fed scenario of high-mass star
formation. However, this trend and its underlying physics are
still not fully quantified owing to the absence of a linear tracer
of evolutionary age.

3. Results
3.1. Linearization of the evolution trend

To investigate the time-dependent evolution of dense clumps, we
adopt the dust temperature (Tyst) as a Monotonic tracer of evo-
lutionary stage. Figure | illustrates the statistical distributions of
ATLASGAL clumps (Urquhart et al. 2018) and the procedure
used to assign a normalized evolutionary age. The probability
density function (PDF) of Tyust (panel a) exhibits a continuous

distribution across the sample, supporting its use as an evolu-
tionary indicator. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of
Taust (panel b) provides a mapping to a normalized evolutionary
age t, expressed in units of a characteristic timescale fo:

t= y CDF(Tuust) fo, qd)
where y is a scaling factor chosen so that y CDF spans a conve-
nient range from 0 to a few. This definition allows each clump
to be assigned a relative evolutionary age, while the absolute
timescale fj) (approximately 10° years) remains undetermined
and can be calibrated in future studies.

Using this relative age, we examine how clump properties
vary with evolution. Panels (c) and (d) show the distribution of
clump mass (M,;) as a function of Tayst and f, respectively, with
clumps having virial mass measurements highlighted. The rel-
atively uniform distribution of M. over ft (nearly constant stan-
dard deviation) indicates that the ATLASGAL sample is unbi-
ased and consistent with a clump-fed scenario, in which the bulk
of the star-forming mass is already present in clumps prior to sig-
nificant star formation. The subsample with M,;, measurements
is evenly sampled for M. 2 100 Mo, covering the clump mass
range relevant for proto-clusters revealed by ALMAGAL (Co-
letta et al. 2025). The mapping from Tgus to t is derived from the
full ATLASGAL sample (panel b), ensuring that the calibration
of ft is representative of the overall population.

Panel (e) displays the distribution of virial mass (Mir),
which shows a positive correlation with Tgus. After lineariza-
tion (panel f), log(Myir) exhibits a tighter linear relation with r,
indicating an exponential increase of Myj, over time. We use this
relation to calibrate y such that Myi, o e', which for the best fit

Within this framework, Myi, can be interpreted as the mass of
star-forming material (Msp) within the clump, suggesting that
clumps undergo exponential accretion of star-forming material
as they evolve. The star-forming gas and forming stars together
constitute the proto-cluster embedded within the host clump, and
to can be interpreted as the characteristic timescale for proto-
cluster formation, during which the proto-cluster mass increases
by a factor of e.

3.2. Maximum core mass
The CMF is believed to be closely linked to the IMF (Motte et al.
1998; Liu et al. 2025), exhibiting a high-mass tail

din(Mee) ”

with a slope shallower than the Salpeter value (@saipeter = 1.35).
Such top-heavy CMFs are widely observed in massive star for-
mation regions (Cheng et al. 2018; Suarez et al. 2021; Liu et al.
2024b). We adopt a fiducial high-mass-end CMF with a = 1,
as suggested by the results of ALMA-IMF (Pouteau et al. 2022;
Louvet et al. 2024). The maximum core mass M2} in a cluster
of total mass Mouster is set by the condition that the cumulative

number of cores above M@** is of order unity:

N(> MBX) ~ 1, (4)
which leads to
ME oc MU2 oc Motuster © Msp. (5)

The positive correlation between the cluster mass (repre-
sented by the total core mass M‘*.) and the maximum core mass

Mes has been observed in the ALMAGAL sample (Coletta et al.
2025). For each host clump in the sample, we calculate the evo-
lutionary age t from the dust temperature Tay (see Eq. 1 and
panel b of Figure 1). A clear linear relation between log, )( Mes

and ft is found (upper panel of Figure 2). The best-fit relation is

MR = 0.9 e' Mo. (6)
This implies that
Mere e' x Msp, (7)

reproducing the maximum core-cluster mass relation predicted
from the CMF.

We therefore suggest that both the cluster mass and the max-
imum core mass undergo exponentially accelerating mass as-
sembly, characterized by comparable timescales, until Msp ap-
proaches the saturation limit set by the available reservoir mass
(M.). Furthermore, we assume that all cores follow a similar
accretion pattern, such that

Mane = HE

e! = Moore. (8)
This accretion pattern is consistent with the concept of competi-
tive accretion, in which more massive cores exhibit higher accre-
tion rates facilitated by the global gravitational potential (Bon-
nell et al. 2001).

Note that the total core mass represents only a small fraction
of Msp. Therefore, at any time before saturation, there remains
ample mass available both for the formation of new core seeds
and for the continued accretion onto existing cores. For simplic-
ity, we neglect the effects of core merging and fragmentation.
Assuming a constant initial core mass function (ICMF; the mass
distribution of nascent cores), the number of cores (Neore) and its
growth rate (Neore) are both expected to follow an exponential
trend:

(9)

We will show in Sect. 4.1 that such a formation and accretion
pattern naturally produces the top-heavy fiducial CMF at the
high-mass end, independent of the assumed ICMF.

3.3. Luminosity evolution

Massive protostars may ignite nuclear fusion during their main
accretion phase; hence both the accretion luminosity (Lacc) and
the intrinsic stellar luminosity (L,) contribute to the total clump

luminosity. We adopt a simple model that neglects the modifica-
tion of L, by the accretion rate M,, and assume the canonical
ZAMS mass-luminosity relation

Lindividual ge 435, (10)
noting that protostellar evolution (e.g., radius inflation at high
M,) can modify this relation (e.g. Palla & Stahler 1991;
Hosokawa et al. 2010). Under the assumption that the mass of
the embedded massive star scales with the maximum core mass,
the clump luminosity is dominated by the most massive object,

(12)

where both R, and M, depend on stellar mass and accretion
history. Since R, typically increases with M,, L'n4vdual depends
only weakly on stellar mass. It is therefore reasonable to approx-
imate the cluster-integrated accretion luminosity as proportional
to the global star-forming mass assembly rate:
Ein? cc)" My oc Msp x Msp x e'. (13)
Thus, while L&2"? grows approximately as e’, the intrinsic lu-
minosity of the most massive star increases much more rapidly
(oc e*°') and soon dominates the thermal feedback once high-
mass stars begin to form. These relations constitute a simplified,
phenomenological framework that assumes a constant core-to-
star efficiency and ignores feedback regulation.

The bolometric luminosity of the host clump can then be
written as

clump _ ;clump , clump _ 3.51
Lo = Lace tly = ae tbe, (14)

where a and b are coefficients to be determined empirically. Ac-
cordingly, ae is expected to evolve as a relatively flat function
of ¢ during the early stages (small t), followed by a sharp increase
at later times (large f) as the intrinsic stellar luminosity becomes
dominant.

This predicted trend is indeed observed in the Lyoi—t diagram
for the ATLASGAL clumps (lower panel of Figure 2), support-
ing the scenario of exponentially accelerating star formation. A
fit to the observed data yields

a=40Lo, b=10Lo. (15)

The intrinsic stellar luminosity dominates over the accretion lu-
minosity from an early stage (t 2 0.5%), consistent with the
rapid emergence of massive protostars in dense environments.

and similarly for the ICMF.

Since the shallowest exponential tail is preserved under con-
volution (Liu 2025), the high-mass end of the CMF retains an
approximately exponential form with truncation at the largest
masses, independent of the detailed shape of the ICMF. That is,
at the high-mass end,

ALMAGAL samples is shown for three time bins. The CMF

builds up and becomes flatter with evolution. This behavior is
consistent with the trend reported by Coletta et al. (2025), who
binned the samples by L/M, and is also qualitatively consistent
with the model prediction given by Eq. 16 (see lower panel of
Figure 3). The slightly enhanced number of high-mass cores, or
the deficit of low-mass ones, may result from the limited sensi-
tivity and field of view of the observations, which tend to filter
out some of the low-mass cores, as well as from the specific
form of the ICMF at the low-mass end, which remains poorly
constrained at present.

4.2. Star formation law

Star formation in dense molecular gas exhibits a remarkably
tight correlation with the mass of dense gas, often referred to
as the dense gas star formation law (Gao & Solomon 2004). Ob-
servations of individual molecular clouds (e.g., Shimajiri et al.
2017) as well as galaxy-scale statistics (e.g., Gao & Solomon
2004) show that the star formation rate (SFR) scales approxi-
mately linearly with the mass of dense gas (traced by HCN or
HCO*),

SFR & Maense, (20)

where Muense denotes the mass of gas above a given density
threshold. In individual molecular clouds, this dense gas is typ-
ically close to virial equilibrium, with Myjr 2 Megas. The cloud-
scale SF law highlights a set of nearly universal properties of
dense clumps within individual clouds. In this work, the expo-
nentially accelerating mass assembly of dense clumps allows
them to rapidly reach a saturated state of star formation, natu-
rally leading to the observed correlation between dense gas mass
and SFR.

Importantly, the SF law can also be extended to the scale
of an individual dense clump. In this case, the SFR scales with
the mass of star-forming gas within the clump, Msp, which we
identify with the virial mass of the clump,

SFR o Msp Msp  Myir & e', (21)

reflecting the exponential growth of the star-forming mass over
time in our model. This formulation suggests that the observed
linear correlation between dense gas mass and SFR, whether
measured for individual clouds or on galactic scales, can be un-
derstood as a natural consequence of the underlying clump-scale
star formation process.

In extreme environments such as the Central Molecular Zone
(CMZ), the SFR is observed to be significantly lower than the
value predicted from the dense gas mass (e.g., Longmore et al.
2012), implying either a higher effective density threshold for
star formation or a lower star formation efficiency per free-fall
time (7), likely due to strong shear and tidal effects. We sug-
gest that the virial mass of dense gas, rather than the total dense
gas mass, may be a more appropriate tracer of the SFR. This
may help reconcile the apparently low SFR in the CMZ, where
the observed SFR is roughly an order of magnitude below the
expected value. If the CMZ gas structures are treated as giant
clumps with a typical virial parameter of @yir = Mvir/Mgas ~ 0.1,
then adopting M,j, instead of Mgas yields a more consistent esti-
mate of the expected SFR in these regions.

4.3. Physical plausibility

The exponential growth of protocluster mass revealed in our
analysis can be naturally understood in terms of simultaneous

core formation and mass assembly within dense clumps, col-
lectively producing an exponential increase of the protocluster
mass. This picture corresponds to a clump-fed scenario, in which
the pre-existing dense clump acts as a mass reservoir while the
protocluster grows dynamically through internal core formation
and accretion. Although the host clump may continue to accrete
material from its surroundings, its overall mass growth rate is
typically slower than the exponential growth of the embedded
protocluster once star formation begins. This indicates that the
accelerating star formation is primarily regulated by the inter-
nal dynamics of core formation and accretion, rather than by the
global growth of the clump.

One may question whether such exponential accretion is
physically realistic. This can be understood by considering the
hierarchical structure of forming protoclusters: subclusters form
and merge within the clump, rapidly increasing the number of
dense cores. Globally, the cluster-scale accretion remains below
the free-fall rate of the clump, but anisotropic, filamentary, or
streamer-like flows can channel material onto the protocluster at
near free-fall velocities for localized portions of the mass. Such
streams may be tidally regulated by the central protocluster, with
their widths scaling approximately as (Jog 2013; Li 2025)

Wstream & Msp (22)
and the mass flux along each stream proportional to Msp,
Msg & Weeream & Moe. (23)

In this way, the combination of hierarchical core formation and
filamentary accretion naturally constructs an effectively expo-
nential growth of the protocluster mass. While this may not cap-
ture all the detailed physics of clump-scale accretion, it demon-
strates that exponentially accelerating accretion is physically
plausible within a self-consistent framework.

5. Summary

We investigate the time-dependent growth of dense clumps and
their embedded protoclusters using ATLASGAL and ALMA-
GAL data. By linearizing clump evolution with dust tempera-
ture, we find that both protocluster mass and the most massive
cores grow exponentially over comparable timescales. This ac-
celerating growth naturally reproduces the observed trends in lu-
minosity, the core mass function, and the mass of the most mas-
sive cores, as well as the dense gas star formation law. Phys-
ically, the exponential increase arises from simultaneous core
formation and accretion, with hierarchical subcluster assembly
and anisotropic inflows providing a plausible pathway for rapid
protocluster growth, while the host clump itself evolves more
slowly.
