Slicks are thin viscous films that can be found at the air—water interface of water bodies such as lakes, rivers
and oceans. These micro-layers are enriched in surfactants, organic matter, and microorganisms, and exhibit
steep physical and chemical gradients across only tens to hundreds of micrometers. In such geometrically
confined environments, the hydrodynamics and transport of nutrients, pollutants, and microorganisms are con-
strained, yet they collectively sustain key biogenic processes. It remains however largely unexplored how the
hydrodynamic flows and transport are affected by the vertical extent of slicks relative to the size of microbial
colonies. Here, we study this question by combining analytical and numerical approaches to model a microbial
colony as an active carpet: a two-dimensional distribution of micro-swimmers exerting dipolar forces. We show
that there exists a ratio between the carpet size and the confinement height that is optimal for the enhancement of
particle transport toward the colony edges through advective flows that recirculate in 3D vortex-ring-like patterns
with a characteristic length comparable to the confinement height. Our results demonstrate that finite, coherent
vortex-ring-like structures can arise solely from the geometrical confinement ratio of slick thickness to microbial
colony size. These findings shed light on the interplay between collective activity and out-of-equilibrium trans-
port, and on how microbial communities form, spread, and persist in geometrically constrained environments

such as surface slicks.

I. INTRODUCTION

Large bodies of water such as oceans, lakes, and rivers are
complex systems, whose environmental dynamics are fun-
damentally influenced by countless interactions at the mi-
croscale, including microbial life [1, 2]. The sea surface
micro-layer (SML) acts as the main precursor for these in-
teractions, as this 1 to 1000 microns thick fluid layer lies
just at the ocean-atmosphere interface, playing a key role in
biogeochemical processes [3]. A characteristic phenomenon
of the SML is the formation of surface slicks: macroscopic
patches with visible difference in color, texture, commonly
oily, and more biochemically complex than the non-slick fluid
nearby. Slicks, that can be of natural or anthropogenic origin,
and range from 0.04 to 200 microns thick and up to 10 km
in length, serve as habitats for special microbial communities
that are a primary source of the energy transported through
the whole water column [4, 5]. In fact, microorganisms can
aggregate and form biofilms of a much larger scale than a sin-
gle cell in response to environmental hostility, thereby main-
taining functionality and surviving at fluid interfaces [6-8].
These self-sustained floating active suspensions, known as ac-
tive carpets, overcome physically challenging environmental
stresses—such as geometrical constraints and changes in tem-
perature, salinity, pressure, and viscosity-through interactions
with each other and their surroundings. Such interactions of-
ten drive these systems into unexpected collective behaviors,
pushing them far from thermal equilibrium [9-12]. However,
how microbial carpets act and adapt within confined viscous
environments such as surface slicks remains unexplored.

Swimming microorganisms self-propel autonomously
through media by exerting mechanical forces and generating
hydrodynamic flow fields [13-22]. Therefore, their individual
and collective behavior is influenced by short-range steric
and long-range hydrodynamic interactions, both between
cells and at cell-interface contacts [23-30]. For instance,
E. coli bacteria are known to accumulate and be attracted
to both solid surfaces and gas and liquid interfaces due
to those interactions and reorientation processes [31-36].
Similarly, recent experiments have confirmed that phototactic
microalgae C. reindhartii accumulate at solid-liquid inter-
faces [37, 38]. Emergent behaviors like self-organization
(e.g. bacterial and algal turbulence) are characteristic of these
microbial multicellular aggregates, having several effects
on their environment [39-44]: they can drive large-scale
fluid flows and directed material transport [45, 46], enhance
diffusive transport and control of cargo—from small nutrient
molecules to entire cells and much larger particles—through
collective entrainment [47-55], generate colloidal (and cellu-
lar) aggregation and self-assembly [56-59], induce coherent
bioconvective patterns and benefit biomixing [60-69].

A common feature of the hydrodynamic responses of these
active fluids is that they arise under some form of physical
confinement — from emulsion droplets to controllable lab-
made chambers, often aiming to emulate real, constrained
and varying environmental conditions [70, 71]. At a single-
cell level, experiments have shown that the flow fields gen-
erated by strongly confined microalgae change and enhance
nutrient flux to the microorganism despite higher friction with
the boundaries [72]. Active-passive mixtures of microalgae
and colloids confined to a channel lead the latter to com-
plex steady-state distributions in a de-mixing process [73] and
more recently it was shown that confined bacterial suspen-
sions spatially self-organize from a immotile inner core to a
motile shell in order to regulate oxygen transport, strictly de-
pendent on suspension density and size [44]. These responses
are also shaped by the properties of the fluid medium, where
viscosity plays a dominant role. This is especially true at the
SML, where viscosity gradients emerge due to temperature
changes, among other [5]. Such gradients influence micro-
bial motility and nutrient transport, while also triggering bi-
ological activity and microbial adaptations. For instance, ex-
periments have shown that blooms of P. globosa, a colonial
marine plankton, can extend up to | km and increase the sur-
rounding viscosity by more than an order of magnitude [74].
Moreover, microbes exploit viscotaxis to survive in viscous
mucus layers: in coral reefs, where viscosity is more than
twice that of seawater and contributes to nutrient redistribu-
tion, and in the mammalian gut and trachea, where mucus
can reach up to three orders of magnitude higher than the
surrounding fluid and serves as a defense against microbial
pathogens [75-79].

A slick-like environment represents a less explored con-
figuration that encapsulates many of these physical stimuli:
a confined interfacial microbial layer characterized by vis-
cous heterogeneity. Some theoretical studies have begun to
address these floating biofilms. Desai et al. [80] developed
a hydrodynamic model to investigate microbial distributions
as functions of morphology, propulsion mechanism, and vis-
cous heterogeneity, providing insights into swimming stabil-
ity and revealing the preferential accumulation of elongated
micro-swimmers at liquid-liquid interfaces [80, 81]. More
recently, Barros et al. [12] theoretically examined the influ-
ence of an extended active carpet of micro-swimmers on the
boundary conditions of floating biofilms. Their study ex-
plored spatial non-equilibrium fluctuations and transport as
functions of confinement size and viscous heterogeneity, re-
vealing anisotropic fluctuation distributions [9, 12]. These
contributions have expanded our understanding of microbial
distributions and long-range collective fluctuations in float-
ing biofilms. However, several questions remain unresolved:
What types of collective flows emerge within these layers? Do
they depend on the interplay between aggregate size and con-
finement scale? And can non-equilibrium transport driven by
active carpet flows under confinement be described indepen-
dently of length scales?

Here we investigate the emergence of three-dimensional
hydrodynamic flow fields generated by active carpets of
pusher micro-swimmers, confined to a slick-like environment.
By fixing the carpet size and varying the geometric confine-
ment determined by hydrodynamic boundary conditions, we
examine how confinement tunes the collective flow field pat-
tern and passive transport within the fluid interface. Taking
a theoretical approach and by performing numerical simula-
tions, we show through a scale-invariant criterion that there is
an optimal confinement where the active carpet induce corre-
lated and long-ranged three-dimensional vortex-ring-like pat-
terns with characteristic length comparable to the confinement
length, enhancing passive transport to the carpet edges in a
process of advective, superdiffusive process. Our findings
demonstrate that the interplay between microbial aggregates
and slick size heavily influences the collective flow, trigger-
ing an adaptation mechanism that might benefit both nutrient
uptake survival in challenging confined viscous interfaces.

Il. METHODS

A. Single microswimmer hydrodynamics
1. Stokelet in an unbounded fluid

Consider a point-force F(a, x.) = f5°) (a — x.) located
at 2, = (Xs, Ys, Zs) acting at a position x = (x,y,z) ina
Newtonian, incompressible, unbounded viscous fluid of vis-
cosity 1. The equations for the induced flow are:

-VP(x) + pV?u(a) + fiP(w@-a,) =0 ()
V- u(x) =0 (2)
where u(a:) is the velocity field and P(a) is the pressure field.

In the far-field, the fundamental singular solution for the flow
is given in terms of the Oseen tensor or Stokeslet:

e—a)= 2 (4+ eae *))

Srp \la— asl |a — a,|?

where I is the identity matrix. Then, the obtained velocity
field is uS (a,x5) = G(a — a): f.
2. Stokeslet in a floating biofilm

A floating biofilm is a liquid layer confined between a
liquid-liquid interface (L-L), and an air-liquid interface (A-
L), both assumed to be non-deformable. We label this liquid
layer as fluid 1, and the semi-infinite fluid beneath the liquid-
liquid interface as fluid 2. For a point-force F(a,a,) =
f5 (a — a.) ata position a, acting on the floating biofilm
at a position a, the equations for fluid 1 and fluid 2 are:

-VP (a) + pV? u (ar) + FIO (a —a,)=0, (4)
Vv: uw) (a) =0, (5)
—VP) (x) + poV?u (a) = 0, (6)
V-ul?) (x) =0, (7)

where j;, P((a),and wu (a) are the dynamic viscosity,
pressure field and fluid velocity field in each respective fluid,
with i = 1,2. The velocity fields w) (a) and u!?)(a) must
satisfy appropriate boundary conditions at both limits of the
floating biofilm. On the bottom, at the liquid-liquid interface,
z = 0, velocity and shear stress must be continuous, whereas
on the top, at the air-liquid interface, z = H, the normal ve-
locity and shear stress must vanish:

w) =u?) at z=0, (8)
du? du? du? du?
i(—a— + a) = mel +) at 2 =0,
(9)
uh) =0, at z=H, (10)
au du?
az + Oa 0, at z=dH. dd

Here a = x, y, and H is the film height.

This set of equations can be solved by using the method of
images, which introduces a set of appropriate image velocity
fields that added to the one of an unbounded Stokeslet flow
in the film generate an the effective velocity field that prop-
erly satisfy the boundary conditions. The fluid velocity field
in the floating biofilm will then be the superposition of the un-
bounded Stokelet velocity and a film image system velocity
antl (cp).

Here we consider w‘!™(a) to account only for the first two
set of images closer to the film as they contribute the most to
the hydrodynamics. Then, the first image system located at a
position x* = (xs,ys,—Zs), accounting for the liquid-liquid
interface, is given by

G'* (a, 5, @3;) = —M*- G(a — #3)

s

+ 26Vsée Gia — @*)+022M-G(a—a2%) (12)

where \ = j12/j11 is the viscosity ratio, ¢) = A/(A + 1),
M® = diag(é5, G9, 1), with Gg = (A+ 1)/(A— 1) and M =
diag(1,1,—1). On the other hand, the second image system,
located at a position 7** = (5, ys, 2H — zs), accounting for
the air-liquid interface is given by

OG" (a,x.,0°(H))=M-G(@—a%*). (13)
The Green’s function for the film is then the superposition:

G(x, as, 03,05", ) &G(a, x5) + Gi" (a, ws, a5, A)

+G°" (x, a5, 0%*(H)). (14)

Thus, the first-order approximate effective velocity field in-
duced in the floating biofilm is

(5)

3. Stresslet in a floating biofilm

Swimming microorganisms are neutrally buoyant, so there
are not net forces exerted over their body. Instead, a micro-
swimmer of size £, swimming with speed v, and swimming
orientation p;, generate thrust forces Fop, that are balanced
by viscous drag forces —Fop, as it translates through the
medium, which can be exerted from the body or the flagella,
depending on the propulsion mechanism, resulting in dipo-
lar forces with strength «, of extensile (« > 0) or contractile
(& < 0) mechanics [16, 22, 83].

Considering this, a multipole expansion performed over the
generated flow across the whole body allows one to describe
the hydrodynamics of the far-field dipolar velocity field, com-
monly known as Stresslet [84]. Omitting the dependence on
the force image positions in the film to emphasize the relevant
parameters, the velocity field can be written as

7 ey

(16)

where V; = 0/0as, & is the dipole strength (scaling as

k ~ @u,, with units of ym?s~!), We set 2 = lym and

vs = 10ym/s, such that K = 30pm3/s, which value is

on the lower range of the measured strength for straight-
swimming E. coli bacteria [19].

2. Active carpet dynamics
1. Definition of active carpet

We consider a finite distribution of N, micro-swimmers
moving in fluid 1, confined within a disk of radius R,
restricted to the plane z,; = h, where each a posi-
tion w, = (pscosYs,pssinys,h) and unit orientation
Ps = (cos ¢s,sin @s,0), and whose exerted flows are evalu-
ated at position x = (pcos y,siny, z), with p, € [0, R], and
s:¢s.¢ € [-7,7]. Here, we consider a constant uniform
distribution f(a5,ps) = fs = n/27, where n = N,/(7R?)
is the micro-swimmer surface concentration, to which we will
refer as active carpet (AC) [9, 10, 12]. Through out this work
we set the micro-swimmer density as n ~ 0.1m?, which is
on the higher range of the values of measured experimental
E.coli densities [85, 86].

2. Average velocity field and circulation

Since the AC distribution is known, it is possible to obtain
the exerted average velocity field by integrating the velocity
field of a single microswimmer u(a@ 5, 2s, Ps; A, H) over it as

(vai H) = [ule es paid H) faded. (17)
s

where S corresponds to the active carpet surface. The average
velocity field magnitude is (|v|) = (v). The average circula-
tion can be obtained directly as T = fo u-dé. A simplified
analytical expression for the velocity u(a,x5,ps;A, H) can
be found by making the approximation h/z < 1 to a first
order before integration [12]. The numerical integrations
shown here were performed using the Wolfram Language
Mathematica [87].

curve defined as an ellipse centered at z = H/2 with width (4R/3
and height (H — 5)/2. Inset: Average velocity over closed curve.

3. Computed flows and tracer particle dynamics

The average velocity field exerted by the AC is computed
by summing over the fluid flows by all micro-swimmers:

Ns
(v(@; A, H)) = So ui(a, as, ps; d, H).- (18)

t=1

To perform this calculation, first, positions x(ps, ys), and
orientations p,(#;,) are sampled by using a Smirnov trans-
form, such that, ps = Ry/wi, ys = —7 + 27we and
os = —m + 27w3, with w; € [0,1] random variates drawn
from standard uniform distribution, for i € [1, 2, 3].

The velocity field can be characterized in all space 2 above
the AC and below the air-liquid interface, with h < z < H.
Hence, tracer passive particles with position 2 = a(t) probe
the fluid flow field, without taking into account thermal fluc-
tuations or short-range interactions [10, 88].

The tracer particle’s equation of motion is:

dx(t) A
a = Bale ie Pat, 2 (19)

subject to the initial condition xj,. To perform numerical sim-
ulations, this expression is discretized using finite differences.
We approximate the solution a by the discrete-time sequence
a, © a(t;) evaluated at the finite time t; = iAt, where At
is a sufficiently small time-step [89]. Finally, we solve the
differential equation using an Euler scheme

Ne
a = 21+) > uj(@ia,as,ps;A,H)At. (20)

t=1

As in Refs. [10-12], we set uniform distributions of swimmer
positions {a,} and orientations {p,} at each iteration i.
C. Spatial correlation function

A useful observable to gain information about the flow
structure is the equal-time spatial correlation function [9, 12,
71]. We compute the (normalized) correlation for the AC
average flow decomposed into its longitudinal (a =||) and
transversal (a =_L) components:

(Va(#) - Va(w + Ar))

(21)

where vy = vx(x)€x + vy(@)éy, VL = vzez, and
Ar = \/Ax? + Ay?. The normalization is computed for the
fixed separation Arp = h.

D. Tracer’s mean square displacement

As mentioned above, tracer particles in the slick can rep-
resent organic material, sediment, or nutrients, and tracking
their trajectories over time allows us to describe the nature
of the flow injected by the active carpet e.g. of advective or
diffusive type. Therefore, we solve the dynamics of tracer par-
ticles and compute their MSD at different confinement levels
(or slick sizes, H) in both directions a:

MSD, (t) = (|@a(t) — @a,0/”)- (22)

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We compute the average velocity field by numerically inte-
grating Eq.(17) for an AC size of R = 150 zm and three slick
thickness: H = 300pum, H = 150pm and H = 75pm.
These cases are analyzed in terms of the ratio H/R, corre-
sponding H/R = 2 (thick slick), H/R = 1 and H/R = 1/2
(thin slick), respectively. The viscosity ratio is fixed as \ =
1/2, assuming that the AC is located within the highly viscous
fluid. The results are shown in Fig.2.

For further analysis, we separate the velocity field (v,) into
its longitudinal (a =||) and transversal (a =) components.
Using the theoretical approach proposed in [9], we obtain an
analytical expression for (v_).

A. Flow descriptions

We observe that the topology of the average flow field gen-
erated by an active carpet, in a viscous film suspended be-
tween two fluid interfaces, of radius R depends strongly on
the geometrical confinement ratio H/R.

In the limit of weak confinement (H/R > 1), the flow ex-
hibits a vertical drift directed towards the active carpet, ac-
companied by a weak recirculating component that decays
with longitudinal distance (see Fig. 2(a)). This behavior was
previously discussed by Mathijssen et al. [9] for an active car-
pet near a no-slip boundary in an unbounded fluid.

When the AC size becomes comparable to the slick thick-
ness (H/R ~ 1), the mean flow develops a vortex-ringlike
pattern characterized by three stagnation points (marked in
dark blue in Fig. 2(b)).

Under strong confinement (H/R < 1), the flow adopts
a hyperbolic topology, with a prominent central stagnation

point whose vertical position shifts upward as confinement in-
creases (see Fig. 2(c)). We therefore hypothesize that a finite-
size active carpet located at the bottom interface of a fluid
layer generates an hyperbolic flow whose center migrates up-
ward as the film height H decreases. When H is large, the stag-
nation center lies near the lower boundary; as H approaches
R, it shifts toward the upper interface, giving rise to a vortex-
ring transition.

To analyze the transition between these flow regimes, we
computed the vertical displacement of the central stagnation
point of the hyperbolic flow as a function of confinement.
Specifically, we evaluated the average vertical velocity v1 at
the active carpet center ( = 0) for different slick thicknesses
H.

Fig. 3a shows that v, takes both positive and negative val-
ues depending on H/R, revealing three distinct regimes. For
strong confinement (H/R < 2/3), the flow remains hyper-
bolic, with the stagnation point located in the upper middle
region, where the vertical velocity is positive throughout most
of the film (blue lines in the figure). As H/R increases, the
stagnation point moves downward toward the mid-lower re-
gion, marking the onset of the vortex-ring regime, where v,_
changes sign smoothly (light-blue region). Finally, for weak
confinement, the stagnation point approaches the lower inter-
face near the active carpet, where a strong downward drift de-
velops, indicated by a pronounced negative minimum in v1
(yellow and green lines).

The inset in Fig. 3a presents the analytical position of the
stagnation point at p = 0 as a function of H/R, showing a
continuous transition from values near the upper interface to
those near the lower boundary.

Next, we evaluated the circulation dynamics around the
point (9 = R, z = H/2). We defined an ellipsoidal contour
of horizontal radius 5R/3 and vertical semi-axis (H — 5)/2,
along which we computed the circulation [ and the mean tan-
gential velocity vc. The results, shown in Fig. 3b, are nor-
malized by n«R, representing the flux per unit line segment
generated by a density n = N,/mR? of micro-swimmers ex-
erting dipolar flows of strength « within a disk of radius R.

The circulation exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on
confinement: it increases approximately quadratically with
H/R, reaches a maximum for 1 < H/R < 3, and subse-
quently decays roughly linearly with H/R.

Fig. 3b inset shows that the average circulation velocity tc
spans the three identified flow regimes:

* tc x (H/R)~°* for the hyperbolic flow,

* Uc © 1.5m/s for the vortex-ring regime,
* Uc x (H/R)~'? for the drift-dominated flow.

B. Particle distributions

To investigate the transport generated in different flow
regimes, we analyzed the resulting particle distributions. We
first examined the Lagrangian trajectories of passive tracer
particles uniformly distributed within a simulation box of size
AV = 3R x 3R x (H — 3). Fig. 4 shows the trajectories
followed by the particles in the three regimes corresponding
to H/R = 2, 1, and 0.5, respectively.
H/R=1/2

and H/R = 1/2 with their respective insets zooming between [—2R, 2R] shown in (d-f). Red circles correspond to the active carpet edge.

For weak confinement, tracers are advected along an elon-
gated vortex ring that induces a strong drift near the center
of the active carpet. This suggests that, if the tracer particles
represent nutrients or essential molecules for the microorgan-
isms, such flow enhances nutrient acquisition at the center of
the active carpet, thereby supporting microorganism survival
in this region.

When the confinement is comparable to the active carpet
size (H/R ~ 1), particles follow the vortex ring streamlines,
resulting in a depleted central region and an accumulation near
the carpet edges. This is consistent with the experimental ob-
servations reported in Ref. [44] where microorganisms located
at the cluster center exhibited anoxic conditions, while those
at the periphery are active due to nutrient availability.

from the vicinity of the active carpet. We can thus infer that
in this regime, nutrient uptake by the carpet is reduced, which
may explain why such configurations are rarely observed in
natural environments, as also suggested by Ref. [90].

Additionally, Fig. 5 presents the final particle position dis-
tributions in both the horizontal (blue) and vertical (green)
directions for the three confinement regimes. Vertically, the
particle distribution is nearly uniform under strong confine-
ment, while for intermediate and weak confinement, a weak
peak emerges near the upper fluid interface. A close-up of the
particle trajectories in the xz plane is also provided for clarity.

To quantitatively characterize particle transport, we mea-
sured the mean squared displacement (MSD) as described in
Sec. III-D (see Fig. 6). We focused on tracer particles trapped
within the long-ranged vortical flows near the edge of the ac-
tive carpet, highlighted by the red circle in Fig. 5. For each
confinement condition, we computed the MSD of the particles
corresponding to the first peak of the longitudinal distribution
PDF|.

In the longitudinal plane, MSD), the particles exhibit a bal-
listic regime at very short times, which rapidly transitions to
a steady oscillatory behavior. This indicates that the tracers
are confined to periodic displacements along the vortex-ring
structures near the carpet boundary.

For the vertical component, MSD |, we observe a distinct
behavior: particles initially move ballistically with a velocity
nearly independent of the confinement H, presumably scaling
with the vertical flux generated by the active carpet, v, «
nk, [9]. At longer times, the MSD saturates to a plateau with
value determined by the vertical confinement height H.

Overall, in the vicinity of the active carpet and in both direc-
tions, particle transport is dominated by advective processes
governed by the flow topology generated by the active car-
pet, consistent with the behaviors we described in the previous
subsection.

Following Sec. III-C and using the analytical expression
from Eq. (21), we calculated the pair correlation functions in
both the parallel and vertical directions for two tracer particles
separated by different radial distances Ar/R. Fig. 7 presents
the results for various confinement ratios H/R, with yellow
tones indicating weak confinement and dark blue representing
strong confinement.

The insets show the normalized correlation length ¢;/R,
obtained from a Gaussian fit to the velocity pair correlations
of the form gy (Ar/R) ~ e((Ar/R)’/287)_ This length scale
represents the characteristic size of the coherent flow struc-
tures, which increases with the slick thickness H. In particu-
lar, for the parallel fluxes, we observe the formation of small
vortices at low H and larger swirls as H increases. The yel-
low region highlights the range associated with ring-like struc-
tures. In the vertical direction, by contrast, the correlation
length increases approximately linearly with the confinement
height H.
IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have investigated how vertical confinement controls the
flows generated by a finite active carpet of flagellated micro-
swimmers, modeled as force dipoles, located near the lower
interface of a viscous surface slick of thickness H and viscos-
ity ratio \. Fixing \ and varying the geometrical confinement
H/R (with R the carpet radius), our analytical approximations
and numerical simulations reveal that coherent flow structures
emerge purely from confinement and from the hydrodynamic
distortions induced by the swimmers.

For strong confinement (H/R < 1), the mean flow adopts a
hyperbolic topology, similar to the flow generated by strongly
confined Chlamydomonas reinhardtii observed experimen-
tally in Ref. [72], with a central stagnation point at p = 0
displaced upward toward the free surface. This configuration
generates an outward jet that ejects particles from the carpet
neighborhood, implying reduced nutrient uptake and provid-
ing a possible explanation for the scarcity of such configura-
tions in natural settings [90]. As confinement is relaxed, the
stagnation point shifts toward the mid-plane (Zstag ~ H, /2),
and for intermediate confinement (H/R ~ 1) a vortex-ring-
like circulation develops whose characteristic length scales
with H. This ring recirculates suspended tracers from the cen-
ter toward the carpet edges, potentially enhancing lateral re-
plenishment and edge activity [44]. Finally, under weak con-
finement (H/R > 1), the stagnation point moves back toward
the lower interface, and the flow exhibits a strong drift directed
toward the carpet, consistent with active-carpet pumping and
substrate-ward currents that promote replenishment [9].

Quantitatively, we find that the vortex-ring radius increases
with H, and that the resulting edgeward recirculation modifies
particle transport: vertical displacements saturate at a plateau
set by H, while longitudinal displacements remain advective
near the carpet boundary. Together with recent analyses of
layered microenvironments and semi-infinite films [12], our
results indicate that finite, coherent vortex-ring-like structures
and the associated transport pathways can be selected by the
single geometrical control parameter H/R. This identifies an
optimal colony size for a given H that maximizes advective
delivery to carpet edges, suggesting testable ecological im-
plications for colony formation, spreading, and persistence in
geometrically constrained habitats such as surface slicks.

Finally, we note that a finite active carpet may also serve
as a minimal physical model for localized ciliary or flagellar
activity on the surfaces of larger bodies or cells, where similar
flow structures and confinement effects can emerge [91, 92].
This connection opens a broader perspective for applying
active-carpet hydrodynamics to biological transport processes
at both microscopic and mesoscopic scales.
