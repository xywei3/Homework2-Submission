We show that the merger of oscillons results in a broad spectrum of the oscillon mass. A huge
number of oscillon samples obtained from numerical lattice simulations reveal that the oscillon mass
distribution has an exponential tail in a heavy-mass region. This enables us to infer the fractional
abundance of heavy oscillons. Using the criterion for the primordial black hole (PBH) formation
from the oscillon collapse obtained in previous studies, we estimate the abundance of PBHs and
conclude that a sizable number of PBHs can be produced from oscillons. It can be an alternative
PBH formation mechanism without employing the tuning of the inflaton potential to enhance the
small-scale density fluctuations in the conventional PBH formation scenario.

Introduction.— The existence of cosmic inflation in
he early universe is now strongly supported by the cos-
mic microwave background (CMB) observations. Ac-
cording to the observed data, a simple quadratic po-
ential for the inflaton, which is a scalar field driving
he inflation, is not favored, implying that the inflaton
has self-interactions [I]. Such self-interactions or interac-
ions with other fields, in general, cause the instability of
fluctuations through parametric resonance after inflation,
which is called preheating [2] [3] (see also [4] for a review).
The strong parametric resonance results in a highly in-
homogeneous universe soon after inflation, in which the
fluctuation exceeds the homogeneous inflaton oscillation
and the system enters a fully nonlinear regime.
The oscillon is a quasi-stable non-topological soliton
of real scalar field [5}{7]. The oscillons can be copiously
roduced following the preheating phase if the shape of
he inflaton potential is shallower than the quadratic one
(SHI2]. The oscillon has in general a finite lifetime but
is typically long-lived [I3HI6]. Thus, it can change the
subsequent thermal history of the universe and can even
ake a role of dark matter [17]. Oscillons can also be pro-
duced from sub-dominant spectator fields, such as moduli
and axions (ALPs) [18}22]. In addition, the formation of
oscillons is accompanied by gravitational wave emissions
[18] [19] [23}27], which can be tested by gravitational wave
observations. See [28}{30] for other observational impli-
cations of the oscillon.

Another intriguing consequence of the inflation sce-
nario is the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs)
(31}33]. The PBH formation occurs typically due to the
primordial density fluctuations generated during infla-
tion. The scale of the fluctuation is expanded beyond
the horizon during inflation, and when the fluctuation
reenters the horizon in the subsequent universe and its
amplitude exceeds some threshold, it can collapse into
a PBH. For reviews, see [34}{36]. The mass of the PBH
depends on the size of the horizon at the formation, and

the lifetime is determined by the mass. If the PBH is
long-lived, it can account for all or part of the cold dark
matter component today. On the other hand, light PBHs
evaporate in the early epoch and can change the thermal
history. In particular, the universe can be successfully re-
heated through the PBH evaporation even if the inflaton
does not interact with the standard model particles.

The oscillon is a nearly-spherical dense object and thus
possibly collapses into a black hole. The PBH formation
from oscillons has been studied in the literature [37}{39]
based on full general relativistic simulations. It has been
shown that a single oscillon can collapse into a black hole
when its mass exceeds some threshold value with some
specific potential forn{’]

In this letter, we study the PBH formation from oscil-
lons in the cosmological context. We perform numerical
lattice simulations for the scalar (inflaton) field to follow
copious oscillon productions. Then, we pick up indivi
ual oscillons and calculate their masses from simulation
data. Finally, we obtain the distribution of the oscillon
mass from a large number of oscillon samples. The resul-
tant oscillon mass distribution shows an exponential tail
due to the merger of oscillons. This enables us to esti-
mate the relative fraction of the heavy oscillons that can
collapse into PBHs, and then the PBH formation proba-
bility is obtained. We show that a significant number of
PBHs can be formed with natural setups, which can ex-
plain the dark matter abundance or reheat the universe
through the Hawking radiatior?]

Model and numerical setup.— Our simulation fo-

1 The PBH formation can also result from statistical fluctuations
of oscillons as discussed in [40}.

2 In Ref. [4]], it turns out that the PBH formation from the oscillon
collapse is unlikely in the cosmological setup. Our result does not
conflict with this previous result because the PBH formation is
still a rare event also in our case and does not occur in typical
cases.
cuses on the early universe just after the cosmic inflation
but before the reheating. In this situation, the inflaton is
the only matter content. Then, let us consider the model
with a single real scalar (inflaton) field, ¢, described by
the following Lagrangian,

£ = -50"60,0-V(0), ()

with the potential given by

V(g) = gama? (+S) =). (2)

where m is the inflaton mass near the minimum of the
potential, A is an energy scale associated with the initial
amplitude of the inflaton, and a is a constant. Assum-
ing the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW)
spacetime with zero spatial curvature, one can derive the
following equation of motion for the inflaton field,

On the occurrence of strong parametric resonance af-
er inflation, which is the case of our interest, inhomo-
geneities grow exponentially, and the system is governed
by nonlinear dynamics even if the initial configuration is
highly homogenized by the inflationary expansion. Then,
numerical lattice simulations are required to solve the
field equation together with the Friedmann equation
in the fully nonlinear regime.
Tn our simulations, the number of grid points is N? =
5123, the initial boxsize is L = 64m7!, and the comoving
attice spacing is Ar = 0.125m~!. The scale factor is
normalized by the initial value, a(t;) = 1. The spatial
derivative is discretized by the central difference with the
second-order accuracy and the dynamical quantities are
updated using the second-order leap-frog method with
the stepsize At = 0.2Ax. The initial value of ¢ is given
by o(t;, 2) = ¢;+6¢(a). We set 5¢ at each lattice site by
the Gaussian random field generated in the Fourier space
with the spectrum of the quantum vacuum fluctuation
[42]. We set ¢; = 0 at each lattice point.

To realize strong parametric resonances and subse-
quent oscillon formations in the present setup, one needs
A < 0.05M,) [10]. Then, throughout the paper, we set
A = 0.05M,) and a = 0.15, but vary ¢;. Note that the

dynamics does not depend on the value of m because it
can be embedded in the normalization of the spacetime
coordinates.

Oscillon merger.— Initial small fluctuations of the in-
flaton are amplified by parametric resonance instabilities.
When the fluctuations become comparable to the back-
ground coherent oscillation, filament structures first ap-
pear as nonlinear objects. Then, the filament is torn into
beads, and they eventually evolve into compact nearly-
spherical energy localizations, i.e. oscillons (see e.g. [19]).
Fig. [I]shows the snapshot of a part of the simulation box
after the formation of oscillons. Oscillons are actively
moving and when two oscillons are closely encountered,
they are either merged into a single oscillon or scattered
each other, depending on the relative phase difference be-
tween two oscillons [43]. Fig. [1] demonstrates the merger
of three oscillons near the center of the box. The merged
object, shown in the right panel of Fig. is highly de-
formed from the sphere but eventually settles to a nearly
spherical object similar to the one in the left panel in

Let us consider the distribution of the oscillon mass as
is done in I]. The mass of each oscillon can be calcu-
lated from the simulation by extracting a box enclosing
a single oscillon, which we call the oscillon box. The first
step is to mark the point where the local energy density
exceeds the threshold p > 4/, with p being the average
energy density in the whole simulation box. Then, we
find the point among those marked points at which the
energy density has a peak, Ppeak, and identify this point
as the center of the oscillon box. The initial size of the
oscillon box is 2° in the lattice unit. The next step is to
enlarge the oscillon box by unit lattice size for each side
along each axis until the energy densities at every grid
points on the surface of the box become lower than the
threshold value, pth = 0.05ppeak- We discard the oscillon
box if it intersects with another one. Finally, the oscillon
mass, M, is obtained by taking the sum of the energy
density over all points in the oscillon box that satisfy
p = 0.05ppeax as follows

We have performed 13,824 simulations with differ-
ent initial (random) data set, and found total 5,440,258
(7,483,222) oscillon samples for ¢; = 1.5A (2A) at the

some samples of the oscillon box. We found that the typ-
ical shape of the oscillon is highly spherical as illustrated
in the left panel. We also found some samples which are
significantly deformed from the sphere as shown in the
middle panel. It may be a configuration just after the
merger of oscillons. We could not totally exclude sam-
pling the oscillon box that contains multiple oscillons, as
shown in the right panel. Such closely encountered os-
cillons will be eventually merged into a single oscillon or
scattered each other as mentioned above.

Fig [3]shows the time evolution of the distribution (his-
togram) of the oscillon mass, M, in units of Mj,/m. In
the early stage, shown in the red, green, and blue curves,
the distribution shows an oscillating behavior. It reflects
the transient dynamics of the inflaton fragmentation fol-
lowed by the oscillon formation. After that, the distri-
bution converges to a smooth curve with an exponential
tail, denoted by

P(M) =exp(A— BM), M= mM (6)

Mh
where P(M)dM denotes the number fraction of oscillons
in a range (M,M+dM), and A and B are some numeri-
cal constants. Such an exponential tail might be a result
of non-Markovian processes due to the multi-step oscil-
lon mergers. Note that a similar situation is reported
in the ultra-slow roll inflation scenario, where the prob-
ability distribution of the curvature perturbation has an
exponential tail [44].

PBH formation.— The PBH formation from the os-
cillon collapse with the same potential has been stud-
ied in [87] [38] using full general relati simulations.
According to Ref. [37], the tentative parameter range for
the oscillon collapse is a ~ 0.1 - 0.2 and A/M,) ~ 0.05 -
0.07. On the other hand, in Ref. [38], viable parameters
for for the collapse are a = 1/2, A = 0.1M)1, M > 2.63,

previous studies, we postulate that the criterion for the

The validity of this assumption should be verified by fully
general relativistic simulations, which is left for future
work.

Here, we assume that the inflaton decays into radiation
(in the standard model or dark sector) with the decay
rate Ty. In our setup, the decay rate should be smaller
than the inflaton mass, [y < m, which puts the upper

Next, we consider an alternative case in which the PBH
is evaporated through the Hawking radiation. In this sce-
nario, we assume that the PBH dominates the universe

This PBH reheating scenario is viable with a wide range

Discussion.— We have shown that oscillons can ex-
perience multi-step mergers, producing heavier oscillons.
Such heavy oscillon productions result in an exponential
tail in the oscillon mass distribution, and it enables us
to infer the fractional abundance of oscillons with arbi-
trarily large masses. Then, based on the previous studies
[37] [38] that demonstrate the PBH formation from os-
cillon collapses, we have shown that a sizable number of
PBHs can be formed from heavy oscillons. It provides
an alternative PBH formation mechanism that does not
require the tuning of the inflaton potential to enhance
the small-scale fluctuations.

Our analysis relies on the previous studies based on the
simulation with the spherical symmetry and the static
oscillaton initial condition. However, the configuration
can be significantly deformed from the sphere, especially
after the oscillon merger. In addition, the merger pro-
cess is highly dynamical and thus the static initial con-
ditions are not suitable. Therefore, the simulation of the
gravitational oscillon collapse should be initiated from

on

more realistic conditions. Moreover, the gravitational [hep-th]
