ABSTRACT

The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaborations have reported gravitational wave (GW) signals from more than 150 Binary Black
Holes (BBHs) in the fourth catalog (GWTC-4). Here, we investigate the population properties of these BBHs using the
mixture-model framework Vamana. We present one-dimensional distributions of masses and spins, explore their correlations,
and examine their evolution with redshift. These features may reflect astrophysical processes associated with BBH formation
channels, although most remain poorly constrained. A notable feature is a peak near 10M in the primary mass and 8MoQ in the
chirp mass. Additionally, the primary and secondary masses correlate uniquely, producing pronounced peaks in the chirp mass
around 14M, and 27Mo. The three peaks are roughly separated by a factor of two. A simple explanation for such well-placed
peaks is a hierarchical merger scenario, in which the first peak arises from mergers of Black Holes (BHs) of stellar origin, and
higher-mass peaks arise from repeated mergers of BHs from lower-mass peaks. Although most binaries do not exhibit the high
spins and characteristic mass ratios expected from hierarchical mergers, those that do are associated with the peaks observed in

the chirp mass distribution.

Key words: gravitational waves — black hole mergers

1 INTRODUCTION

With the release of the fourth gravitational-wave catalog, the
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaborations have more than dou-
bled the number of gravitational-wave signals (Aasi et al. 2015;
Acernese et al. 2015; Akutsu et al. 2021; The LIGO Scientific Col-
laboration et al. 2025a,b). A key objective of gravitational-wave as-
tronomy is to understand the physical processes that form and merge
compact binaries. Often, the approach is to reconcile the anticipated
distribution from proposed formation scenarios with the features ob-
served in the compact binary mass, spin, and redshift distributions.
Thus, the development of methodologies that accurately infer the
population and connect the inferred population to proposed forma-
tion scenarios is essential.

Significant progress has been made in developing parametric and
non-parametric methods to infer the compact binary population.
Parametric methods have employed combinations of power laws,
normal distributions, tapering functions, and notch filters to infer
the BBH mass distribution (Talbot & Thrane 2018; Wysocki et al.
2019; LIGO Scientific Collaboration & Virgo Collaboration 2019;
Fishbach et al. 2020; Farah et al. 2022; Golomb et al. 2023; Gen-
nari et al. 2025). Non- and semi-parametric methods utilising a large
number of parameters have revealed additional details in the BBH
mass distribution (Tiwari 2021; Sadiq et al. 2022; Rinaldi & Del
Pozzo 2022; Edelman et al. 2023; Abbott et al. 2023a; Toubiana
et al. 2023; Sadiq et al. 2024; Ray et al. 2024; Callister & Farr 2024;
Heinzel et al. 2024a). The mass distribution shows an emerging struc-

ture composed of several peaks. The first peak is observed around
a chirp mass of 8My (10M in primary mass) (Tiwari & Fairhurst
2021; Li et al. 2021). The second peak is observed around a chirp
mass of 14M, (Tiwari & Fairhurst 2021; Abbott et al. 2023a; Ti-
wari 2024). However, the second peak is not statistically significant
in the primary mass (Farah et al. 2023; Callister & Farr 2024). A
third peak is observed around a chirp mass of 28Mo (35Mo in pri-
mary mass) (Talbot & Thrane 2018; LIGO Scientific Collaboration
& Virgo Collaboration 2019; Roy et al. 2025).

Significant effort is also underway to investigate the spin distribu-
tion of BBHs (Tong et al. 2022; Vitale et al. 2022; Golomb & Talbot
2023; Périgois et al. 2023; Baibhav et al. 2023; Adamcewicz et al.
2024; Biscoveanu et al. 2022; Hussain et al. 2024; Banagiri et al.
2025; Biscoveanu 2025). So far, drawing confident astrophysical im-
plications from spin distributions has been challenging, due in part
to a lack of strong signatures in the distribution (The LIGO Scientific
Collaboration et al. 2025b), and in part due to large uncertainties in
the spin magnitudes predicted by formation scenarios (Bavera et al.
2020; Belezynski et al. 2020; Zevin & Bavera 2022; Ghodla & El-
dridge 2024). Additional uncertainty arises from processes that can
alter spin orientations (O’Shaughnessy et al. 2017; Steinle & Kes-
den 2021; Baibhav & Kalogera 2024), compounded by our limited
ability to measure spin components orthogonal to the orbital angu-
Jar momentum (Miller et al. 2024; Hoy et al. 2025). Marginal mass
and spin distributions together can better constrain the physics of
formation channels predicting both distributions (Belczynski et al.
2020; Banerjee 2021; Mapelli et al. 2022), and the joint mass-spin
distribution is now available from multiple analyses (Tiwari 2022;
Heinzel et al. 2024b; Ray et al. 2024; Pierra et al. 2024b; Sadiq
2 = V.Tiwari

et al. 2025). However, due to the small number of GW observations,
large model uncertainties, and the variety of proposed formation
scenarios (Mandel & Broekgaarden 2022), investigations focusing
on mass-dependent spin distributions remain limited. Mass ratios
and their correlations with spins can reveal imprints of formation
channels (Farr et al. 2017; Callister et al. 2021; Galaudage et al.
2021; Golomb & Talbot 2023; Adamcewicz et al. 2023; Kinugawa
et al. 2024; Heinzel et al. 2024c,b; Hoy et al. 2025), but no channel-
specific trend has yet emerged.

Motivated by the two dominant peaks around 10Mo and 35Mo
in the primary mass distribution and the variation of spins with
mass, multiple analyses suggest the presence of two dominant sub-
populations contributing to BBH mergers (Godfrey et al. 2023; Ray
et al. 2024; Li et al. 2024; Antonini et al. 2024; Pierra et al. 2024a;
Hussain et al. 2024) (alternatively, see Ho et al. (2024) for a three-
sub-population model producing three peaks in the chirp mass dis-
tribution, Mahapatra et al. (2025) for hierarchical mergers fitted to
primary mass peaks, and Afroz & Mukherjee (2025a) for multiple
sub-population fits.). However, the additional peak around 14M,
complicates the interpretation.

Investigations for specific scenarios are comparatively straightfor-
ward. For example, unique features in the mass and spin distributions
are characteristic of a hierarchical merger scenario (Doctor et al.
2020; Payne et al. 2024; Tagawa et al. 2021; Mahapatra et al. 2025).
In this scenario, the remnant from a merger may be retained by the
environment, forming another binary that merges within a Hubble
time (Gerosa & Fishbach 2021; Antonini et al. 2019; Mapelli et al.
2021; Chattopadhyay et al. 2023).

In a specific case, the first-generation (1G) BBHs are dynamically
formed from BHs of stellar origin distributed in a narrow mass range
due to a pile-up caused by a mass gap. The remnants of these 1G
mergers constitute second-generation (2G) black holes with masses
around twice those of the 1G black holes. A small fraction of rem-
nants retained by the environment can form heavier BBHs. This
process can continue, creating higher-generation black holes. In this
case, successive peaks in the mass distribution appear at roughly
a factor of two apart!. After the release of GWTC-2, we reported
four well-placed peaks in the chirp mass distribution following this
multiplicative factor (Tiwari & Fairhurst 2021), and additional ob-
servations after GWTC-3 retained these peaks (Abbott et al. 2023a;
Tiwari 2022). While hierarchical mergers provide a simple expla-
nation for these well-placed peaks, two predicted signatures remain
largely absent at the population level: the scenario predicts high-spin
black holes with dimensionl ins peaking around 0.7, and inter-
and intra-generation mergers yielding mass ratios of roughly 1.0,
0.5, 0.25, ... (Lousto et al. 2010; Fragione & Rasio 2023). Notably,
the high-spin BBHs we observe do exhibit the expected mass ratios
and spin magnitudes. Moreover, their measured masses also coincide
with the peaks in the chirp mass distribution — a correlation that is
difficult to explain if the peaks arise from unrelated processes.

In this article, we report the population properties of BBHs in-
ferred using the mixture-model framework, Vamana. The article is
organised as follows: in Section 2 we briefly discuss our methodol-
ogy, in Section 3 we report the population properties of BBHs, in
Section 4 we discuss the high-spin population, and in Section 5 we

summarise our results.

' Around 4—6% of mass is lost to gravitational waves, so the factor is slightly

2 METHOD

We use the mixture model framework, Vamana (Tiwari 2021), to
infer the population properties of the BBHs. In the previous version
of Vamana, the chirp mass and mass ratio were used as the mass pa-
rameters. In the current version, we use the primary and secondary
masses instead. In addition to masses, Vamana also infers the aligned
spin (the component of spin aligned with the orbital angular momen-
tum) and the redshift evolution of the merger rate. The components in
the mixture model are multivariate Gaussians used to infer the mass
and spin distributions. They also include a power-law to characterise
the redshift evolution of the merger rate. Together, this provides a
four-dimensional inference of the population. Section A provides a
detailed description of the model.

Several independent groups have reported new BBH signals after
analysing the open data from the LVK (Venumadhav et al. 2019; Nitz
et al. 2019; Zackay et al. 2019; Venumadhav et al. 2020; Nitz et al.
2020, 2021; Olsen et al. 2022; Wadekar et al. 2023; Nitz et al. 2023;
Kumar & Dent 2024; Mishra et al. 2025; Mehta et al. 2025; Koloniari
et al. 2025). However, since sensitivity estimates are required to infer
the population accurately (Tiwari 2018), we only use observations
reported by the LVK collaborations (Abbott et al. 2019, 2021, 2024,
2023b; The LIGO Scientific Collaboration et al. 2025a). We select
all observations with a false alarm rate of at most one per year
and a mean secondary mass greater than 3Mo. These criteria are
satisfied by 153 observations, 69 of which were reported by the LVK
in GWTC-3. The estimated parameters for these BBHs are publicly
available (LIGO Scientific Collaboration et al. 2023).

3 POPULATION PROPERTIES

Vamana infers the two-component masses, the aligned spin com-
ponents, and the redshift evolution of the merger rate. The aligned
spins are assumed to be identically but independently distributed
for both BHs. In this section, we present the inferred distributions
marginalised over the modelled or transformed parameters and the
correlations between them.

3.1 Marginalised Distributions in One Dimension

Figure | shows the inferred distributions of primary, secondary, com-
ponent, and chirp masses. These are obtained by marginalising over
spins and redshift distributions, yielding the distribution on the com-
ponent mass plane defined by the primary and secondary masses.
Marginalising over the secondary (primary) mass then yields the dis-
tribution of the primary (secondary) mass. If the designation between
the primary and secondary is removed, i.e., p(m2,m,) = p(m1,m2),
one obtains the component mass distribution. Finally, transforming
parameters as (7 ,m2) = (M,q) produces the chirp mass and
mass-ratio distributions. All distributions show a prominent over-
density at the lower end of the mass spectrum, supported by more
than 40 observations. The first peak in the chirp mass distribution
spans 6-10Mo. It contributes approximately 66% to the astrophysical
merger rate of BBHs?. The chirp mass distribution exhibits a local
minimum around 10Mo, where the mean density drops by a factor of
28 from 7.2Mo to 10.2Mo, and then rises by a factor of 4 at 12.9Mo.

? This fraction is sensitive to the prior on the Gaussian locations for the
masses. Currently, we adopt a uniform prior, P( im, 3 Or; Hy) = constant.
A steeper prior, e.g., P (Hm) + Mmy) = 1/(Him, > Hmy ), increases this fraction
to 78%.

Mass Parameter [Mo]

Figure 1. The mass distribution of BBHs. Solid curves indicate the median, and shaded bands show the 90% credible intervals for the differential merger rate.
All mass parameters show an over-density at the lower-mass end. The chirp mass distribution exhibits four distinct peaks, with the first three exceeding a 99%
confidence level. The region between the first two peaks is labelled ‘gap’ due to a lack of observations. Subsequent peaks are separated by approximately a
factor of 1.9, shown by brown lines 2. The distribution, dR/dM|z is described in sub-section 4.2. Other mass parameters show local maxima at comparable
locations, but with lower confidence. Primary and secondary masses uniquely correlate to produce the peaks in the chirp mass distribution (see sub-section 3.2.1).

MNRAS 000, 1-12 (2025)

This ‘gap’ corresponds to a lack of observations with mean chirp
masses between 8.9 and 11.7Mo and is discussed in Section 4 in the
context of a hierarchical merger scenario. Using methodologies from
Tiwari (2024) and Tiwari (2025), we estimate over 99% confidence
in the two peaks around 14Mo and 26Mo (see Roy et al. (2025) for
a detailed study of this peak). Other mass parameters exhibit mod-
ulations at comparable locations, but with limited confidence. For
distributions where component masses are uncorrelated, a peak in
the component mass distribution typically produces a peak in the
chirp mass at a slightly smaller value (by a factor of 2°?) and in
the primary mass at a value roughly 1.2 times larger. The presence
of a confident peak in the chirp mass distribution, without a com-
parable peak in the primary or secondary masses, implies a unique
correlation between the component masses, di: ed further in sub-
section 3.2.1. Figure 2 shows the inferred mass-ratio and aligned
spin distributions. In previous reports, the mass-ratio distribution was
found to peak at unity (Tiwari 2022), which was an artefact of using
a power law to infer the distribution. Modelling component masses
with Gaussians allows a more flexible inference. The inferred distri-
bution is uniform, mainly between 0.6 and 0.9, with a wide credible
interval due to limited precision in mass-ratio measurements. This
suggests no strong evidence for preferential pairing of comparable-
mass binaries. The aligned spin distribution is symmetric, peaking
around 0.05, with most observations consistent with small aligned
spins. Priors on model hyperparameters have a noticeable impact
on the inferred mass ratio and aligned spin distribution (Baird et al.
2013; Vitale et al. 2017b; Tiwari et al. 2018) as these parameters are
strongly correlated and are measured with significant uncertainty. A
prior that favours smaller aligned spin values results in the inferred
mass ratio being larger, and vice versa.

Figure 3 shows the redshift evolution of the merger rate. Models
assumes a power-law evolution of the merger rate, R(z) = Ro(1 +
z)* (Fishbach et al. 2018), Where Ro is the merger rate at redshift
zero. Merger rate is estimated to be, Ro = 14.0°S$Gpc* yr}, The
right side of Figure 3 shows the evolution of the merger rate with the
redshift. The evolution is confidently positive with x ranging from
0.44.7 at 90% credibility. Priors make a noticeable impact on the
inferred values of x and merger rate. Prior that favours populations
with larger sensitive volumes results in smaller merger rates, e.g., a
prior on k extending to large positive values.

3.2 Correlation between parameters

We now examine correlations between the modelled or transformed
parameters. Instead of computing posterior predictive distributions
on a multidimensional grid (with Jacobian corrections for transfor-
mations), we draw a large number of samples for component masses,
aligned spins, and redshift. All figures in this sub-section, except the
differential merger rate on the component mass plane, are generated
by histogramming these samples.

3.2.1 Correlation between mass parameters

Figure 4 shows the differential merger rate on the component mass
plane, revealing three prominent over-dense regions corresponding
to peaks in the chirp mass distribution. The region associated with
the 14Mo chirp mass peak exhibits a unique correlation between pri-
mary and secondary masses: it creates a prominent chirp-mass peak
without producing a comparably strong peak in the individual com-
ponent masses (see Figure 1). This can also be observed in Figure 5.
The mass ratio varies, forming a jagged curve for both the primary

MNRAS 000, 1-12 (2025)

and total mass. The correlation changes sign around a primary mass
value of 19Mg. This feature is more prominent in the primary and
almost absent in the chirp mass. We have previously reported this
feature for observations in GWTC-3 (Tiwari 2024, 2025). Chirp mass
is the most accurately measured parameter. Although it is not a pa-
rameter directly relevant to astrophysical processes, the presence of
a strong feature in the chirp mass requires investigation.

The effect of this correlation is reflected in the distribution of
mass ratios. Mass ratios for the second peak significantly contrast
with those for the third peak located around the chirp (primary)
mass value 27M. (35M). By making random draws for mass ratio
corresponding to the second peak (11.0 < Mo < 19.0) and the third
peak (19.0 < Mg < 32.0), we find the third peak has a larger mass
ratio for 85% of the draws.

3.2.2 Correlation between mass ratio and aligned spin

Previous studies report correlations between effective spin and mass
ratio (Callister et al. 2021; Adamcewicz et al. 2023). Using the up-
dated Vamana model, we continue to find an essentially flat relation
between aligned spin and mass ratio, with slight broadening at lower
mass ratios. Random draws indicate that binaries with q € [0.1, 0.5]
have larger aligned spins than those with g € [0.5, 1.0] in 60% of
draws.

3.2.3 Correlation between mass parameters and aligned spin

Figure 7 shows that aligned spins are generally low across most of the
mass range, but increase for heavier binaries. For chirp masses below
35.Mo, the 90% credible interval for aligned spins is 0.05—0.25, rising
to 0.1-0.4 above 35Mo. Random draws indicate heavier binaries
have larger aligned spins in 80% of cases. This trend, along with two
dominant primary-mass peaks, motivates the use of multi-population
models for BBH observations.

3.2.4 Redshift evolution of the population

Vamana models the redshift evolution of the merger rate as a power
law, allowing components in different parameter-space regions to
evolve differently. Figure 8 shows the ratio of merger rates at z = 0.5
and z = 0 as a function of mass. Previously, the evolution appeared
shallower for the heaviest binaries (M > 35Mo) at 90% credibil-
ity (Tiwari 2022), but with additional observations, this confidence
drops to 70%. The luminosity distance, degenerate with the inclina-
tion angle, is measured with a large uncertainty, limiting the precision
with which population evolution can be measured. Figure 9 shows
population-averaged mass ratio and aligned spin versus redshift. Both
remain largely flat, indicating no significant evolution of binary pair-
ing or spins. Large credible intervals reflect the limited information
from GW observations.

4 HIERARCHICAL MERGERS

Observation of peaks in the component mass distribution, with their
relative locations bearing a constant factor, is characteristic of a hier-
archical merger scenario. In this scenario, the first peak corresponds
to the first-generation (1G) mergers between BHs of stellar origin,
and the higher-mass peaks are due to repeated mergers of BHs rem-
nants from the lower-mass peaks. The relative location of peaks is
expected to bear a factor of around 1.9, which accounts for the dou-
bling of masses and approximately a 5% loss in mass due to the

emission of GWs (Barausse et al. 2012). The location of peaks im-
plies mass ratios of roughly 1, 0.5, 0.25, and other combinations,
resulting from intra- and inter- generational mergers. In addition,
these binaries often have high spins (Lousto et al. 2010).

4.1 High-Spin Binary Black Holes

Although a majority of the population does not exhibit the expected
characteristics from the hierarchical merger scenario, binaries with
high spins do. Moreover, these high-spin binaries exhibit mass ra-
tios and aligned spins consistent with expectations from hierarchical
mergers. Notably, the components of most of the high-spin binaries
are associated with the peaks observed in the chirp mass distribution.

3 If the spin magnitude is narrowly distributed around 0.7 and orientations
are isotropic, the aligned spin distribution is approximately uniform extending
from -0.7 to 0.7.

The first peak in chirp mass is located around 7.5Mo. The compo-
nent mass for a comparable mass binary corresponding to this value
is 7.5 x 2°? = 8.5Mo.*. Consequently, the BHs involved in intra-
and inter-generation mergers will have masses distributed aroun:
8.5Mo X 1.9 = 16.2Mo and 8.5Mo x 1.9? = 30.7Mo. We previously
noted that in addition to high spins, observation GW190412 (Ab-
bott et al. 2020) with mean masses 8.3-30.1Mo is consistent with
a 1G-3G merger (Tiwari & Fairhurst 2021). GW151226 (Abbott
et al. 2016), and the recently announced GW241011_23383 an
GW241110_124123 have masses consistent with 1G-2G merg-
ers. Observation GW230624_113103 has masses consistent with a
2G-3G merger (The LIGO Scientific Collaboration et al. 2025a).
Most of the BHs masses for high-spin binaries are close to the values
we calculated. To demonstrate this, we select high-spin binaries an:
infer the mass distribution of their components. GWs provide limite

aligned with the orbital angular momentum, sj, and s2,. We select
all the BBHs with mean effective spin magnitude greater than 0.2,
ice. |(verr)| > 0.2. This is not the most robust criterion for choosing
high-spin BBHs, as it cannot discriminate whether one or both BHs
have high spins or account for the presence of in-plane spin. But,
overall, the spins of BHs in the selected binaries are expected to
be substantially higher. The mass ratio and spin distribution of the
chosen binaries are shown in Figure 10.

These observations have mass ratios clustered around 1.0 and 0.5.

MNRAS 000, 1-12 (2025)

GW190412 has a mean mass ratio of around 0.25. The high-spin
binaries constitute a population substantially different from the BBH
population as shown in Figure 11. In addition to differing in spins as
expected due to our choice, the two populations also differ in mass
ratio.

Using individual mass and aligned-spin measurements from the se-
lected binaries, we infer the distributions of BH mass and aligned
spin. The methodology details are provided in Appendix B. These
inferences are shown in Figure 12. The BH masses cluster around
specific mass values. The brown lines compare the peaks in Figure 12
with the peaks observed in the chirp mass distribution shown in Fig-
ure 1. We note that the peaks in the component mass distribution for
the high-spin population are complementary to the peaks observed
in the chirp mass distribution of the full population.

tion. The redshift evolution has been fixed to uniform in comoving
volume. Choosing a steeper evolution shifts the peak to lower masses.
This change is noticeable but small and impacts heavier mass peaks
more. As noted in Appendix B, the pairing probability of BHs has
not been modelled; inclusion of which will have a noticeable effect
on this structure. Overall, the confidence in the structure is weak,
but it suggests that the component masses of high-spin binaries are
complementary to the peaks in the chirp mass distribution. This
structure has become increasingly pronounced with the increase in
the size of the GW catalog. Each observation run has accumulated an
increasing number of high-spin BBHs whose components are con-
sistent with the peaks in the chirp mass distribution. Figure 12 also
shows the three BH masses measured via astrometric observations
with Gaia (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2024). The number of BHs is
expected to increase significantly with Gaia’s next data release (Na-
garajan et al. 2025). Masses of these BHs will make an interesting
comparison with Figure 12.

4.2 Chirp Mass as the Mass Parameter

Chirp mass is the most dominant term that affects the phase evolu-
tion of a binary (Cutler & Flanagan 1994). It is measured with the
smallest uncertainty and is least affected by any biases. The inferred
chirp mass distribution is expected to reflect its true astrophysical
counterpart most accurately. Due to this, chirp mass is sometimes
used as one of the mass parameters along with the mass ratio of the
binary when inferring the BBHs mass distribution. In principle, any
pair of mass parameters can be used to infer the underlying mass
distribution, and the distributions of the other mass parameters can
then be obtained through the appropriate transformations. In prac-
tice, however, population models often lack the flexibility to capture
the complex Jacobians involved in these parameter transformations
accurately. For example, the chirp mass distribution inferred by ap-
plying a parameter transformation after using the primary mass and
mass ratio as mass parameters may differ from that inferred directly
when the chirp mass is used as the mass parameter. For this particular
reason, we use a correlation term between the primary and secondary
mass to model other mass parameters as accurately as possible. This
correlation term is often not present in population models.

Despite its accurate measurement, chirp mass may not be the
most appropriate mass parameter. For example, when inferring com-

7

ponent mass distribution in the hierarchical merger scenario, both
inter- and intra-generational mergers contribute to the same set of
peaks. However, although intergenerational mergers will contribute
to the primary peaks in the chirp mass distribution, intragenerational
mergers will create additional peaks. The recently announced binary
GW241110_124123 (LIGO Scientific Collaboration et al. 2025) that
was observed in LVK’s 04b run with a mean chirp mass of around
9.9Mo fills the 10-12M. chirp mass gap reported earlier (Tiwari &
Fairhurst 2021; Tiwari 2025). Components of GW241110_124123
exhibit high spins and mass asymmetry. Other observations, such
as GW151226 (Abbott et al. 2016) and GW241011_233834 (LIGO
Scientific Collaboration et al. 2025), also partially fill the gap and
have similar properties. Therefore, the removal of intra-generational
mergers would reinforce the chirp mass peaks from the hierarchi-
cal merger scenario. We remove binaries with a mean effective spin
magnitude greater than 0.2 and a mean mass ratio less than 0.65.
Our choice is motivated by the expected mass ratios and high spins;
however, this is not the most robust criterion for selecting intra-
generational mergers, and it does not ensure the removal of all the
intra-generational mergers. Nevertheless, at the population level, this
will sharpen the peaks in chirp mass. The resulting "mass ladder"
distribution, dR/dM|y71, is shown by the orange curve in Figure 1.

5 CONCLUSION

In this article, we have reported the population properties of bi-
nary black holes following the fourth LVK gravitational-wave cat-
alog, which roughly doubles the number of observed events. One-
dimensional distributions of mass, mass ratio, and spin, along with
their correlations and the redshift evolution of the merger rate, have
been presented. While most features remain tentative and require
more observations to establish robust confidence, the three peaks in
the chirp mass distribution are notable. These peaks are not mir-
rored at comparable confidence in the primary or secondary mass
distributions, reflecting a unique correlation between the component
masses. Their locations, spaced roughly by a factor of two, can be
simply explained in the context of hierarchical mergers.

While the overall paucity of high spins challenges a naive hierar-
chical picture, the component masses combine to produce a markedly
pronounced structure in the chirp-mass distribution. The chirp mass,
being the most precisely measured mass parameter, does not di-
rectly map onto formation physics; conversely, spin inferences are
less precise and influenced by modelling, priors, and selection ef-
fects, potentially underrepresenting a high-spin population. Notably,
the subset of high-spin binaries exhibits component masses that align
with the peaks in the chirp mass distribution, offering direct evidence
in support of hierarchical scenarios.

Taken together, these observations raise the question of whether
hierarchical mergers may dominate the shaping of the binary black
hole mass distribution rather than representing only a minor contribu-
tion. Even if spins remain difficult to measure, the mass distribution
alone carries signatures of hierarchical processes. With the remain-
ing fourth observation run expected to roughly double the current
catalog, these signatures can be tested more rigorously, offering an
opportunity to refine our understanding of binary black hole forma-
tion channels.

orientation, the corresponding prior on Ye is shown on the figure using a dashed red line. We use BH masses measured from these binaries to infer the BH

Figure 11. The KS p-values between possible values of mass ratio and effective spins between the high-spin BBHs used in estimating BH mass distribution
shown in Figure 12 and BBHs used in estimating the chirp mass distribution shown in Figure 1. Although the two populations differ significantly, their mass
distributions are strikingly similar. The vertical brown lines make this comparison. To calculate KS p-values, we randomly selected one sample per observation
and computed the KS p-value for that selection. The histogram shown was created from multiple p-values calculated across various selections. The p-value
between samples from the same population is expected to be uniformly distributed. However, the histogram’s p-values are significantly skewed towards small
values. The estimated parameters use a standard prior. In practice, these estimates should be re-weighted to population-informed priors. We don’t expect that

would meaningfully impact our conclusion.

APPENDIX A: MODEL DETAILS

We utilise 10 components in the mixture model. The functional form
of Vamana is described in Equation Al. Hyperparameters and their
priors are listed in Table Al. Vamana infers the joint distribution of
primary mass, secondary mass, aligned spin and redshift evolution
of merger rate. Components are multivariate normals combined with
a power law. The cross-terms for the covariance matrix between dif-
ferent parameters are set to zero, except for the covariance between
the primary and secondary mass. This enables the mixture model to
accurately infer the distribution of chirp mass. The BBH population
is inferred from observations with a false-alarm rate of at most once
per year. We only used observations reported by the LVK collabo-
rations (Abbott et al. 2019, 2021, 2024, 2023b). Only observations
with a mean chirp mass greater than 5Mj are used. We excluded
GW 190814 and any observation consistent with a binary neutron
star and neutron star-black hole binary from our investigations. The
total number of observations chosen is 153. The binary parameters
are estimated in the detector frame; we assume the Planck 15 cosmol-
ogy (Ade et al. 2016) to convert to source-frame quantities.

APPENDIX B: INFERRING BLACK HOLE MASS AND
SPIN DISTRIBUTIONS

Vamana infers the distribution on the component mass plane using
truncated Normals. The data products impose a condition mz < m,,
i.e., the primary mass is always larger than the secondary mass. An
alternative approach is to reflect the data in the component mass
plane, which eliminates the need to truncate the multivariate Gaus-
sians (Sadiq et al. 2025). The model can then be modified to infer the
component mass distribution directly, but this also requires inferring
the pairing probability between the BHs, as we need to infer two mass
parameters. We have only a limited number of observations, and we
fix the mass-ratio distribution and redshift evolution to the standard
prior used in parameter estimation (Ashton et al. 2019). Moreover,
we only use a diagonal covariance matrix. Therefore, we have just a
one-dimensional mixture model to infer the component mass distri-
bution and aligned spin distribution using BH mass and aligned spin
measurements from BBHs, To obtain posterior on hyperparameters
requires calculating the term (Loredo 2004; Mandel et al. 2019),

components and index k goes over the parameters estimated for
an observation obtained using the standard prior, ppg. As we have
fixed the prior on the redshift evolution of the merger rate and mass
ratio, the standard prior is ppg « (1 + ghrky2 because it is uniform
on the detector frame masses. Similarly, spins are assumed to be
uniform in magnitude and isotropically distributed; the prior on the
aligned component of the spin is o =log(|si**|)/2 and o

The product of these terms is calculated for each component. A
weighted sum is calculated for each observation. The sums of all
the observations are multiplied to obtain the final likelihood. When
inferring the component mass distribution shown in Figure 12, we
ignore the contribution of any BHs with a mean secondary mass
greater than 40M. when evaluating the likelihood. This restricts the
focus to only inferring the first three peaks, as the third peak is located
approximately 30Mo. This paper has been typeset from a TRX/ISTEX file
