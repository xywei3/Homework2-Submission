Radiation—matter hybridization allows atoms to serve as mediators of effective interactions be-

tween light modes and, conversely, to interact among themselves via light.

Here we exploit the

spatial structure of atomic ensembles to control the coupling between modes of distinct cavities,
thereby reshaping the resulting atom—photon spectra. We show that extended homogeneous clouds
suppress mode—mode couplings through destructive interference, whereas grated clouds can preserve
them under specific Bragg conditions. This leads to mode-mode spectral subsplittings, where col-
lectivity arises not only from the atom number but also from the ability to tune modes of different
cavities independently. Our results establish spatially engineered atomic ensembles as a pathway to
selective photon transfer between modes and precise control of many-body complexity.

Introduction- The preparation of atomic ensembles in-
side high-finesse optical cavities represents a major mile-
stone in cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED), as it
grants access to regimes of collective strong light—matter
coupling [1-8]. Such an achievement stimulated a wide
range of ensemble-based applications, from controlling
chemical reactions [9, 10] to implementing quantum
memories [11, 12] and quantum transduction proto-
cols [13]. Ideal global coupling, as captured by the
Tavis~Cummings model [14], requires that all atoms cou-
le identically with strength g to a single cavity mode —
a condition attainable only when the atoms are indistin-
guishable, as in a Bose-Einstein condensate [6]. In prac-
ice, even a spatially homogeneous ensemble of N atoms
departs from this limit: the spatial averaging over atomic
ositions and cavity-mode functions effectively reduces
he collective coupling from gVN to g\/N/2 [6, 15, 16],
weakening atom-—photon hybridization in the resulting
Tavis-Cummings polaritons. More generally, any spa-
ial inhomogeneity in the atomic distribution can degrade
collectivity [17], with consequences for nonclassical prop-
erties such as cavity-field photon statistics [18] and bi-
artite atomic entanglement [19, 20]. Therefore, the
nonuniformity of the coupling in CQED systems is not
merely a detail, but a key ingredient that modifies fun-
damental atom-light properties [12].

In multimode cavity scenarios, atomic ensembles act
as mediators of effective intermode interactions, leading
o additional avoided crossings in the energy spectra [21—
23]. Understanding how density profiles shape such spec-
ral structures and splittings is not only of fundamental
interest, but also paves the way for new self-organized
hases in cold atoms (24, 25], controlled photon transfer
in cavity arrays [26], and the implementation of quantum
gates [27, 28]. Along these lines, Ref. [22] reported four-
mode coupling in a single Fabry-Perot cavity through
atomic clouds with a Gaussian spatial distribution, where
oth the number of resonances and the magnitude of the

splittings were controlled by the cloud width. More re-
cently, Ref. [23] theoretically investigated two counter-
propagating modes in a ring cavity coupled through one-

dimensional atomic arrays, showing that the lattice spac-
ing sets the spectral modifications. In these two previous
works, however, the atom—mode couplings of the differ-
ent interacting modes were not independently tunable,
a key simplification relative to the framework developed
here.

In this letter, we show that spatial modulations in the
atomic density are crucial to preserve the coupling be-
tween modes of distinct cavities, and thereby allows one
to manipulate the energy spectrum of many-body CQED
systems. Motivated by recent experiments with ultracold
atoms in mutually rotated linear cavities [25, 29, 30], we
derive a M-mode model in which mode-mode couplings
are expressed through a density-dependent structure-
factor matrix. We demonstrate that large Gaussian
clouds suppress this structure factor through destruc-
tive interference, while a grating imposed on the atomic
profile restores intermode couplings via Bragg scatter-
ing. Under such a constructive interference condition,
we uncover novel subsplittings in which collectivity de-
pends not only on the number of atoms but also on the
distribution of different atom—mode couplings. Our ap-
proach offers a practical means to control the complexity
of many-body CQED systems, with potential relevance
for multimode quantum technologies [28, 31-34].

Coupled-mode model.— We consider an ensemble of N’
two-level atoms fixed in space, simultaneously interact-
ing with M quantized light modes, each confined into a
different optical cavity. The detuning A,, of each mode
m from the atomic transition, as well as the correspond-
ing constant atom-mode coupling gm, can be individu-
ally controlled. This system is described by the follow-
ing Hamiltonian, derived in the rotating-wave approxi-

where the raising (lowering) operator 6; = |e;) (g;| (ai =

ulation operator. The symbol 4,,,(ai,,) denotes the pho-
ton annihilation (creation) operator for mode m, which is
characterized by its wavevector k,,. The standing-wave
profile of mode m modulates the atom-mode coupling as
Jm COS(Km -¥j), with r; representing the position of atom
j. We pump only mode m = 1 using a laser with Rabi
frequency 7 and detuning A from the atomic transition,
and adopt it as the reference frame. The remaining M—1
modes thus acquire photons solely through scattering by
the atomic cloud. Fig. 1 illustrates the particular case of
two modes in crossed cavities.

From Hamiltonian (1), we obtain the quantum-optics

which yields coupled equations for the expectation val-
ues of atomic and cavity-mode operators, as detailed in
the Supplemental Material (SM). The decay rate T of
the excited atomic state and the dissipation rate kK, of
each mode m induce a steady state in the system. We
then focus on the weak-drive limit, 7 <I’, Km, where the

atomic excited-state population is negligible, (67) xl,
so that only the coherences remain relevant to describe
the atom dynamics. In this regime, the quantum corre-
lations simplify to (674m) = —(G@m), leading to a set of
linear algebraic equations for the steady-state variables
(@m)ss and (6;)ss. Substituting the solution for (;)ss
into that of (@m)ss, we obtain a closed set of coupled

mode equations for m,m/ = 1,2,...,M:

atomic density distribution p(r) [35]:

RK 1/[kn +km|, we find sGa"8 ~ 1 for all m,m’, cor-
responding to the regime of uniform coupling between
the modes. The same structure factor can be realized
in a two-dimensional lattice, where all atoms are posi-
tioned near the maxima of the checkerboard standing-
wave field [30].

The bright and dark frequencies of a subwavelength

nian (1) and its degeneracies, see SM. These frequencies
correspond to the eigenenergies of the effective reduced

When the Gaussian cloud is wide enough to resolve the
cavity modes, R > 1/|Km —Ky/| for m 4 m’, destructive
interference suppresses the off-diagonal terms of Eq. (7),
leaving s$2°55 ~ dmm/2. Consequently, Cmm’ © 0, and
the injected light remains confined to the pumped mode,
(@1)ss * iQ, while all other modes are not populated
((4m)ss © 0 for m 4 1). Thus, a sufficiently extended
Gaussian cloud reproduces the case of a homogeneous
distribution interacting with a single cavity mode [15, 16],

ID, «2 = 47, 7 =0.01F, N = 10', and A; = Ay = 0.

and is therefore inefficient at coupling different modes.
This behavior becomes evident in the panels of Figs. 2(a)
and (d) as kR increases: the pumped-mode spectrum
rapidly converges to a pair of single-mode Lorentzian
peaks, at A = +9),/N/2, while the amplitude of the
nonpumped mode decays exponentially. Moreover, in
mode 1, a single antiresonance remains at A = 0, reveal-
ing the formation of a purely atomic dark state induced
by the weak pump [21].

The effective single-mode system generated by a wide
Gaussian cloud can be fully described by the following

see SM. Thus, we are reducing the complexity of the

many-body system by one dimension compared to

that of a subwavelength atomic cloud, and modifying

drastically the hybridization of the atom-photon system.
Grated cloud.— Still in the context of Gaussian distri-

butions, Figs. 2(a) and (d) reveal an intermediate regime
(0 < kR < 2) where the spectra acquire a more intricate
structure. As the cloud shrinks, the gradual recovery of
mode-mode coupling causes the two original symmetric
peaks to further split, giving rise to four bright states
and three accompanying dark states. However, because
the structure factor decays exponentially with kR [see
Eq. (7)], the cloud widths that sustain this rich spectrum,
keeping the collective strong-coupling regime, are much
narrower than those typically achievable in cold-atom
platforms. This highlights the importance of exploring
alternative atomic configurations that can support the
full spectral structure under more accessible conditions.

Let us consider a Gaussian density distribution with a
spatial modulation of wavevector q,

which describes a grating [25, 36] with a Gaussian en-
velope. Such an atomic distribution can be readily im-
plemented experimentally by applying a one-dimensional
optical lattice, with the associated structure factor inte-
gral (6) admitting the following exact solution:

ote that the pure Gaussian result is recovered for q = 0.
Applying the limit kR — 0 in Eq. (11), one recovers
sGrated _ Gauss ~ 1 for all q, as the grating becomes
irrelevant. However, for extended clouds, a vector q that
meets any of the constructive interference conditions,
2q+ (Kez a kyar)| < 1/R or |2q + (km — km’)| < 1/R,
revents the elements of the structure factor matrix from
vanishing: sGrated = 1/4 for m’ A m and Sim © 1/2.
This occurs because a suitable Fourier component of the
grating provides a Bragg condition that allows light scat-
ering between a given pair {m,m’} of cavity modes [37].
We illustrate this point in Figs. 2(b) and (e), which
display the cavity spectra for the same two modes as in
Figs. 2(a) and (d), but now in the presence of an atomic
grating of wave vector q = (k; + kg)/2. In contrast
o the pure Gaussian case, the amplitude of the non-
umped mode no longer vanishes with increasing kR,
and the bright resonances in both modes do not merge
into two peaks. Instead, they remain distinct, with their
frequencies drawn closer together due to the reduced
structure factor (s@f#*e¢ = 1/4). For the two modes
of Fig. 2, a linear deviation q = (1 + ©) (ki +k) /2
from the optimal coupling condition « = 0, with € a
nonnegative parameter, results in the asymptotic expan-
sion sated ~ eW (FR) /4 for large kR. Therefore, the

constructive interference condition remains robust for
€<1/kR.

For a sufficiently extended grating satisfying one of
the four conditions mentioned before, and still under the
strong-coupling regime, the four resonances correspond
toA = {Gx, -Gx}, where we introduce the following
collective frequencies:

1 a2
G = a (at +08 Vl? +087 ~30he8). 02)

Note that the cross term 391g is a signature of the col-
ective mode—mode coupling. According to Fig. 2(f), the
subsplittings satisfy G+ > G— > 0, with their separa-
ion scaling as G, —G_ = /N (9? +93 - v39192) /2 for
91,92 > 0. In addition, Fig. 2(c) shows how a nonzero go
modifies the single-cavity spectrum (dashed lines), gen-
erating two additional avoided crossings separated by an-
‘iresonances. Thus, the atomic grating preserves the col-
ectivity that manifests itself as a function of distinct
atom—mode couplings, a feature that is unattainable with
homogeneous clouds.

As previously mentioned, a suitable grated distribu-
ion preserves three distinct antiresonances in large cloud
imit, kR — co. The central antiresonance, at A = 0,
corresponds to a dark state formed by an antisymmet-
ric superposition of the ground state and all elements
of the single-excitation basis with no photons in either
mode [21]. In this case, the excitation tends to remain
rapped within the atomic ensemble, which explains the
antiresonance in both modes. By contrast, the side an-
‘iresonances at A = 99\/'N/2 (£g2V/N in the subwave-
ength case) correspond to hybridized atom—photon dark
states that involve a photon in the second mode. Since
he weak drive cannot simultaneously populate both cav-
ities, destructive interference ensures that the photon is
confined to the nonpumped mode only. This mechanism
can be exploited to achieve selective photon population
chrough density modulation in the atomic cloud.

The dynamics of an effective two-mode system sus-
rained by the grating atomic distribution can be de-
scribed by the following 5 x 5 matrix:

0 a 0 0 0
