I. INTRODUCTION

Statistical mechanics ca:

n be reformulated from the

perspective of quantum information, as outlined in the
seminal work of Deffner and Zurek [I}4]. Historically,

however, the subject was e

stablished by Maxwell [5] [6],

Boltzmann. [4] [7] and Gibbs [8] [9], who formulated the

statistical description of many-particle systems based on

probabilistic principles. In particular, the postulate of

equal a priori probabilities
librium has long served as a

‘or an isolated system in equi-
cornerstone of the theory. Al-

though remarkably successful, these principles are typi-

cally introduced as assump
explanatory power than by

ions, motivated more by their
derivation from the first prin-

ciples [10]. This has left open the question of whether

statistical mechanics admit:

s a deeper foundation.

Recent developments suggest that such a foundation

by Zurek [11] and further developed by Deffner and
Zurek [I], demonstrates that objective probabilities and

Our investigation proceeds as follows:

1. Principle of envariance — We begin by review-

ing envariance, following Deffner and Zurek [I] [TJ]
in Sec. [II] and explain how it underlies the assign-
ment of equal a priori probabilities in the micro-
canonical ensemble

. Probability distributions — We then derive the

Binomial, Poisson, and Gaussian distributions in
Sec. [I] as natural consequences of quantum mea-
surement statistics, showing that classical random-
ness is unnecessary; instead, statistical structure
arises from entangled quantum states.

. Resolution of the Gibbs paradox — We briefly

review the canonical ensemble and Boltzmann dis-
tribution in Sec. as the natural statistical de-
scription of a quantum system coupled to a heat
bath, following the work of Deffner and Zurek
{0 [13]. This review builds on the microcanoni-
cal framework and connects seamlessly to thermo-
dynamics, making the presentation self-contained.
Next, we revisit the Gibbs paradox [8] [T9]
in Sec. showing that the spurious entropy of
mixing for identical particles is canceled by an
entanglement-based correction enforcing indistin-
guishability. We illustrate how this correction is
negligible for gases under ordinary conditions but
significant in the ultra-cold regime.

. Modified Saha equation — Finally, we ap-

ply our framework to ionization equilibrium in

Sec deriving a quantum correction to the
cl al Saha equation [20]. In this context,

Sec. [VI] presents how Bose-Einstein and Fermi—
Dirac statistics emerge directly from envariance
and particle indistinguishability, eliminating the
need for heuristic combinatorial arguments.

Ultimately, this paper aims to present a unified nar-
rative in which the laws and distributions of statisti-
cal mechanics are not separate ad hoc constructs, but
are interconnected results that emerge from the symme-
tries and information-theoretic properties of the quan-
tum world [21] [22]. By doing so, we seek to identify and
solidify the foundation of statistical mechanics, ground-
ing it irrevocably in the quantum laws that govern our
universe. The principle of envariance, as subsequently re-
fined in later works [23}27], continues to provide a bridge
between quantum foundations and statistical inference.

II. REVIEW THE PRINCIPLE OF
ENVARIANCE [i]

Consider a quantum system S$ that is maximally en-
tangled with an environment E. Let |g) denote the
composite state of the system and environment in the
Hilbert space Hy ® He. The state |Wsz) is said to be
envariant under a unitary operation Us acting on the
system S iff there exist another unitary operation Ug
acting on the environment EF that can restore the origi-
nal state [II]. Mathematically:

(Us ® Iz)|Vsz) = |®sx) (1)

(Is ® Uz)|®sxz) = |Vsx) (2)

The key insight is that the action of Us on the system
can be perfectly compensated by an action Ug on the
environment alone.

A. Example: Two-Level System

Let system S and environment E be two-level systems
(qubits). The eigenstates for S are {| t)s,| l)s} and for
E are {| t)z,|1)z}. Assume that they are prepared in a
maximally entangled Bell state [13]:

Gqllse@l the +I s@1Ye) (3)

[Wse) =
Let us consider a ‘SWAP?’ (or spin-flip) operation Us on
the system S, which corresponds to the o,-Pauli opera-
tor) such that

1
(Us ® In)¥se) = (| Ys 11)
+|t)s | {)e) = |®sz)

The state has changed. Now, can this be undone by
acting only on the environment? Let us apply a corre-

sponding ‘SWAP’ operation Ug on the environment EL:

il
J2
+ (Is © Up)| 1)s @| Vx)

(Is ® Ug)|®sx) (Us ®Uz)| Vs @| te

va lls@liet| ts @| Ne)

= |Vse)

The swap on E has restored the original global state with-
out touching S. Therefore, the state |Wgj2) is envariant
under the spin-flip operation Ug [IJ 11] [13].

Implication for Probabilities. The fact that the states
| t)s and | |)s can be swapped by a transformation
that leaves the global state invariant implies that any
measurement on the system must assign equal proba-
bility to these two outcomes. The local probabilities of
the swapped states are both exchanged and unchanged,
hence they must be equal. This provides a fundamental
justification for the principle of equal a priori probabil-
ities [I] [7] [8]. Recent developments in decoherence and
quantum Darwinism [28}31] strengthen this interpreta-
tion of statistical mechanics as a theory of emergent clas-
sicality.

B. Microcanonical equilibrium and probability
distributions from envariance

a. Envariance and the Schmidt decomposition.
Consider a pure state of a composite system S + E
written in its Schmidt form

vse = > ax|Sx) ® En), (6)
k

where, {|S;)} and {|E,)} are orthonormal bases for the
system S and environment EF, respectively; a, € C are
the Schmidt coefficients (we take them non-negative real
by phase choice when convenient); the sum runs over the
Schmidt rank. The Schmidt form is a canonical bipartite
decomposition — all reduced statistics of S are encoded
in {ax} and {|S;,)} (1) {13}.

b. Maximal envariance > equal Schmidt weights. A
state is maximally envariant if for every unitary Us on S
there exists a unitary Ug on E such that Eqs. are
satisfied. hold for all Us, then all nonzero
Schmidt coefficients must have the same modulus:

ar| = —= Vk (in the active subspace), (7)

va
where (2 is the number of terms (the effective
of the degenerate subspace). For the N-qubits example,
Q = 2%, is the dimension of the support of pg, if the en-
tire computational basis participates. Equal magnitudes
are necessary and sufficient for the existence of compen-
sating unitaries Ug that undo any Ug acting within the
support — hence “maximal” envariance.

imension

c. Equiprobability from envariance. Tracing out the
environment yields the reduced state of the system

ps = Tre(WWse)(Wsel) = Yo lael*|Se)(Sel- (8)
k

If the state is maximally envariant, then |a,|?> = 1/Q

following Eq. and

Q

1a => Si(Sil, -P(Sk) = = (9)
k=1

where P(S;) = ($;.|5|S,) is the Born probability [32)[33]
of the system being in state |S,). Envariance enforces
that local permutations/swaps on S$ can be undone by
£ — therefore, no S$; is distinguishable by local actions
and all must be equiprobable.

d. Physically motivated Hamiltonian. To motivate
emergence of envariance dynamically, consider a symmet-
ric, pairwise form:

N
Hsp = So (As, @In, +Is,® Hz, + 9A: ®@B;) (10)
i=l

where, S = @, Si, E = @; Fi; Hs,, Hn, are local Hamil-
tonians; A; ® B; is the interaction operator acting iden-
tically on each pair (S;,E£;) with coupling strength g.
Identical coupling forms (“symmetric interaction”) fa-
vor permutation-symmetric entanglement patterns and,
when acting within a degenerate subspace, lead the global
state toward the maximally envariant structure of Eq.
with equal weights. The envariance-based symmetry ar-
gument has been extended through information-theoretic
formulations and the framework of quantum resource the-

Ill. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS FROM
QUANTUM ENVARIANCE PRINCIPLE

A. Binomial Distribution
1. maximally entangled case

First, we consider N identical two-level subsystems
(qubits) and label each system basis by |t) and |{). The
maximally envariant state over the full computational
subspace can be written as

1

where the sum runs over all binary strings S =
(S1,...,$y) and Q = 2N. |Bg,...9,) are orthonormal
environment states that record which system configura-
tion occurred. Equation is precisely the equal-weight
Schmidt form across the 2% computational states.

We ask: What is the probability P(n) of finding ex-
actly n subsystems in |)? Count the number of compu-
tational strings with Hamming weight n (i.e., exactly n
up-spins): this number is CG): Using equiprobability [cf.
Eq. (9}I,

— (a)

P(n) = a) = a. (12)

Here, N is the total number of qubits; n is the observed
number of |t) outcomes. Since each of the 2 fine-grained
states is equally likely, the probability of the coarse-
grained event “n up-spins” equals the fraction of fine-
grained states having that property.

2. General binomial distribution via ancilla embedding

To obtain a biased single qubit probability p 4 1/2
while still using envariance, embed the physical system
into a larger fine-grained space (ancilla/auxiliary system)
as follows. Choose positive integers m and M with 0 <
m <M and set

a= we, 13)
P= 57 (
Construct an enlarged uniform superposition over MN
fine-grained states such that each physical |?) is corre-
lated with m orthogonal ancilla labels and each |{) with
(M —m) labels. Counting fine-grained states that corre-
spond to exactly n physical up-spins gives

N ;
#(fine states with n) = ( ) m"(M—m)%~", (14)
n
Dividing by the total number M¥% of equiprobable fine
states gives

_ (@) m"(M —m)N-" _ (N
P(n) MN (

) pr(1—p)*™,
(15)

where positive integers m and M are chosen such that
p = m/M; the ancilla Hilbert space provides M or-
thogonal labels per subsystem; M¥ is the total num-
ber of fine-grained equiprobable states. The ancilla
embedding maps unequal coarse amplitudes into equal-
weight fine-grained microstates; envariance then guaran-
tees equiprobability at the fine scale and yields the stan-
dard binomial law on coarse-graining.
Remarks. All the above probabilistic structure arises
from the single physical principle of envariance: sym-
metry under local transformations on S compensated by
E. Maximally envariant (equal-Schmidt) states produce
equiprobability, and auxiliary embeddings allow one to
extend the argument to generic (biased) probabilities.

B. The Poisson Limit

The Poisson distribution can be obtained as a limiting
case of the binomial distribution. In the limit N — oo,
p— 0, with \ = Np held finite, the binomial mass func-
tion reduces to

=i N\ N=n _ ate +.

Pin) = gim (Jona —ps"="S". ao)

p70

This captures scenarios involving rare but finite events
across many trials, a situation frequently encountered
in quantum measurement of low-probability processes.
The significance of the distribution in quantum mechan-
ics is exemplified by the photon statistics of coherent
states [88] [39]. The Poisson distribution also emerges
naturally from quantum statistical ensembles, underscor-
ing its relevance to foundational quantum mechanical
frameworks involving entanglement and decoherence [40+
[43]. For completeness, the step-by-step derivation of
Eq. from the binomial distribution is provided in
Appendix A.

C. Gaussian Approximation of Measurement
Outcomes

We aim to demonstrate that the probability distribu-
tion of measurement outcomes on a system of a large
number of identical qubits approaches a Gaussian distri-
bution. This is a quantum mechanical analogue of the de
Moivre-Laplace theorem [45], which states that the
binomial distribution can be approximated by a normal
(Gaussian) distribution under certain conditions.

Consider a system of N identical qubits, each indepen-
dently prepared in state |usz) = \/p| t) + VI —pl I).
The global state is a product of these states [II]:

N

bse) =@(volti+VI-PWs) (07)

i=1

where p is the probability that a single qubit being in the
state | t) and 1 — p is the probability that a single qubit
eing in the state | |).

Expanding the tensor product yields a sum over all
computational basis strings. Every basis string with
Hamming weight n appears with amplitude pr. _

each x; can be | t) or | |). Here ‘strings of weight n’

sian distribution (see Appendix B)

with mean \ = Np and variance 0? = Np(1—p). This
hierarchy of statistical distributions is consistent with the
modern understanding of quantum statistical mechanics,
wherein equilibrium properties are understood to arise

from the dual concepts of typicality and eigenstate ther-

malization [3} [12\ [21] (22) {46}.

Iv. THE CANONICAL STATE FROM
QUANTUM ENVARIANCE

We briefly summarize the canonical state and the
Boltzmann distribution following Refs. {13] by con-
sidering a small system of interest in contact with a large
heat bath.

a. Setup. Separate a large, isolated system S (which
is in a microcanonical state) into two parts:

e C: A smaller subsystem of interest.
e B: Its complement, which acts as a large heat bath.

The total Hamiltonian of the system S' is Hy = He @Ig+
Ic ® Hg + Hin. We assume ultraweak coupling, meaning
the interaction term Hint is negligible for calculating the
total energy € + E€¢ + Ex, but it is necessary to facilitate
energy exchange between C and B [47].

b. Counting States. We start with the maximally
envariant microcanonical state for the total isolated sys-
tem S. An energy eigenstate of the composite system
can be written as a product state |k)5 = |cn)c ® |br),
where |c,) and |b,) are energy eigenstates of C and B,
respectively. We are interested in the properties of the

small system C. If C is found in a specific energy eigen-
state |c;,) with energy e,, then for the total energy to be
conserved at €, the heat bath B must have an energy of
Eg = E—e€,. The number of states accessible to the total
system, given that C has energy €,, is equal to the num-
ber of states (degeneracy) of the heat bath B at energy
E —e€,. Let us denote this by ng(€ — ex), so that

n(ex) = np(E — ex). (22)

The probability of finding the small system C in state
ck) with energy €, is proportional to the number of
states available to the bath, n(e,), which corresponds
o this most probable distribution. Since the probability
P(ex) x n(ex), and In P(ex) «x Inn(ex), we can find the
dependence of the probability on e,. The key is that the
otal energy of the bath is E—e,. The logarithm of the de-
generacy will be approximately linear in its energy. The
degeneracy of the bath ng(Eg) is related to its entropy
Sp(Eg) by Sg = kg lnng. Expanding the entropy around
he total energy € gives Sp(E€ — ex) © Sp(E) — &./T,
where we assume that the bath has an infinite heat ca-
acity. Therefore, Inng(€ — e,) ¥ Inng(E) — Bex. This
shows why the logarithm of degeneracy is approximately
inear in €,, leading directly to the Boltzmann factor. So,
nn(€x) * —Gex-+const. Therefore, the probability is [I]:

Plex) x e7 Pex (23)

This is the Boltzmann distribution, derived from the fun-
damental principle of envariance. The parameter is
identified with the inverse temperature, 8 = 1/(kgT).
This connection is in line with the modern understanding
of equilibration hypothesis and eigenstate thermalization
(ETH) in closed quantum systems [48}53].

V. RESOLUTION OF THE GIBBS PARADOX
VIA QUANTUM INDISTINGUISHABILITY AND
ENTANGLEMENT

The Gibbs paradox arises in the classical statistical
mechanics of ideal gases. When two identical gases are
mixed at the same temperature and pressure, the clas-
sical theory incorrectly predicts an increase in entropy,
known as the “entropy of mixing” [8] {18} [19]. This para-
dox is resolved by considering the quantum-mechanical
indistinguishability of identical particles.

A. The Classical Paradox

Consider mixing two ideal gases, both at temperature
T and occupying volume V. Gas 1 has Nj particles and
Gas 2 has No particles. Using the Sackur—Tetrode equa-
tion for entropy [8} [19], the initial total entropy for
identical gases is

Sinitial = Nikp (nV + 3InT +0)

24
+ Nokg (nV+2mT +o), (4)

on

where o is a constant arising from Sackur—Tetrode ex-
pression (depending on particle mass, Planck’s constant,
etc.). After removing the partition, the combined system
of N = N, + No particles occupies a total volume 2V.
The final entropy is

Stina = (Ni + No)kp [n(2V)+2lnT+o]. (25)

Since the gases are identical, so that both are described
by the same o and if we take N, = Np = N for simplicity,
the change in entropy becomes

AS = Sginat — Sinitial = 2Nkg In 2. (26)

This nonzero entropy of mixing for identical gases is the
Gibbs paradox. It seems to suggest that entropy is not
an extensive property: doubling the system size by mix-
ing two identical gases does not simply double the en-
tropy, but instead produces an additional spurious con-
tribution [8] [54] (55).

The resolution lies in quantum statistical mechan-
ics [56]. Identical particles are indistinguishable and per-
mutation does not generate new microstates. When this
indistinguishability is correctly taken into account, the
spurious entropy of the mixing disappears [54]. The en-
tropy then becomes extensive, consistent with the fun-
damental principles of thermodynamics. In traditional
quantum statistical mechanics, the apparent paradox is
resolved by properly counting microstates through sym-
metrization or anti-symmetrization of the wave function.
The total wavefunction of a system of N identical par-
ticles must satisfy a permutation symmetry condition.
Exchanging any two particles leaves the wavefunction un-
changed (for bosons) or multiplied by a minus sign (for

fermions) [57]:

Wsn(ti,---,tw) = 9" Vse(ta()s---s0m(n)), (27)

where 7 is a permutation that belongs to the symmet-
ric group of degree N, and g™ = +1 for bosons and
—1 for fermions. This indistinguishability requirement
modifies the canonical partition function, since identical
microstates must not be counted multiple times. The
correct quantum-mechanical expression is therefore

_ a

Zn = Wr?

(28)
where Z, is the single-particle partition function and the
1/N! factor removes the classical overcounting of identi-
cal configurations.

Using the thermodynamic relation

a
S= FlkeTnZy), (29)

then the Sackur-Tetorde entropy [18] [19] becomes

4 5
S=Nkp [im Gas) + 3] , (30)
where Ain = h/V2nmkpT is the thermal de Broglie
wavelength. This entropy is extensive: doubling N and
V doubles S. Consequently, when two identical gases are
mixed, there is no unphysical entropy increase, resolving
the classical Gibbs paradox.

B. Resolution of the Gibbs Paradox via Quantum
Envariance

From the perspective of quantum envariance, the indis-
tinguishability of identical particles naturally arises from
entanglement between the system and an external envi-
ronment that records particle permutations. The total
system-environment state can be represented as a puri-
fied, permutation-symmetric superposition:

|Wse) = -@ |Wse, iy) @ |Ex),

(31)
where |)sx2,,,) denotes the i-th single-particle state after
permutation 7, |E,) are orthonormal environment states
corresponding to each permutation, and g™ = +1 for
bosons or —1 for fermions. This construction ensures the
general invariance of the composite state under particle
exchange.

Tracing out the environment yields the reduced density
matrix of the physical system:

it
PN = aD
©

which represents a maximally mixed state over all N!
particle permutations. The von Neumann entropy of
this mixed state is therefore

or Ls bse, ay)

(32)

Sent = —kg Tr(pn npy) = kgln N!. (33)

Using the Stirling’s approximation, InN! ©» Nin N —N,
this becomes

Sent © Nkp(InN — 1). (34)

The term in Eq. precisely cancels the non-eztensive
entropy of mixing that appears in the classical Gibbs
paradox. In the c cal treatment, when two identi-
cal gases are mixed, the total entropy increases by an
unphysical term

ASnix = 2Nkg In 2, (35)

even though no new microstates are physically distin-
guishable. This excess arises because the classical count-
ing of microstates treats permutations of identical parti-
cles as distinct, artificially inflating the number of acces-
sible configurations.

In the envariance-based framework, the entropy Sent =
kglnN! accounts for the redundancy caused by these

indistinguishable permutations. When subtracted from
the naive classical entropy, it restores extensivity:

Sqm = Sci — Sent: (36)

Here, 5.1 denotes the entropy computed under the as-
sumption of distinguishable particles following the clas-
sical Boltzmann counting rule, Sq = Nkg[In(V/\3,) +
3/2]. This form scales super-linearly with particle num-
ber N because permutations of identical particles are
over-counted, leading to the non-extensive behavior re-
sponsible for the Gibbs paradox. Subtracting the indis-
tinguishability correction Sent = kg ln N! removes this
overcounting and yields Sym = Nkp[In(V/NA$,) + 5/2],
which is identical to Eq. the Sackur—Tetrode ex-
pression of entropy for an ideal gas. This result explicitly
shows that the entanglement-induced indistinguishability
correction restores extensivity: when both N and V are
scaled by the same factor, Sgm increases proportionally
to the number of particles, ensuring that the entropy re-
mains extensive. Thus, Eq. (36) provides the missing
quantum-mechanical link that resolves the Gibbs para-
dox within the envariance framework.

Above, we ensure that doubling both N and V dou-
bles the entropy and that mixing identical gases produces
no spurious entropy increase. Thus, Eq. represents
the entanglement entropy that removes the non-extensive
contribution responsible for the classical Gibbs paradox.
So, the key insights are as follows:

1. Correction 1/N! originates from two complemen-
tary quantum principles: (i) the permutation sym-
metry of identical particles, which eliminates over-
counting of indistinguishable configurations, and
(ii) the envariance-induced entanglement between
the system’s permutation degrees of freedom and
its environment, which formally enforces this sym-
metry at the level of the density matrix.

2. In the classical (Boltzmann) limit, when the ther-
mal de Broglie wavelength is much smaller than the
inter-particle spacing (NA$,/V < 1), the overlap
of single-particle wavefunctions becomes negligible.
Consequently, quantum exchange effects vanish and
the indistinguishability correction reduces the par-
tition function to the standard form [cf.

glcortected) _ mi ziciossical) (37)

This is precisely the classical limit used in deriving
the Sackur—Tetrode entropy.

3. The Sackur—Tetrode equation already incorporates
the 1/N! correction implicitly, hence it yields
an extensive entropy and correctly resolves the
Gibbs paradox. The entanglement entropy Sent =
kpilnN! derived here should therefore be viewed
not as an additional correction, but as a micro-
scopic origin of the same term. From the envari-
ance perspective, Sent represents the entropy asso-
ciated with tracing out the environment that en-
codes indistinguishable permutations, providing a
quantum-information—theoretic justification for the
1/N! factor in the Sackur—Tetrode formula.

Thus, the Gibbs paradox finds its resolution through
the unified principles of quantum indistinguishability and
envariance-induced entanglement [1} {13}, which to-
gether ensure correct microstate counting and preserve
the extensivity of entropy.

1. Validity of Quantum Corrections in Entropy
Calculations

The classical Sackur-Tetrode expression [I8] [19] for
he entropy of an ideal monatomic gas does not assume
hat the particles are distinguishable; rather, it already
incorporates the indistinguishability correction through
he inclusion of the 1/N! factor in the partition func-
ion. This ensures proper counting of microstates and
resolves the Gibbs paradox within the classical frame-
work. However, the Sackur—Tetrode formula assumes
hat quantum statistical effects such as exchange cor-
relations and wavefunction overlap are negligible. This
approximation is valid when the thermal de Broglie wave-
length Aan = h/V2rmkgT is much smaller than the
mean interparticle spacing. More precisely, quantum cor-
rections are negligible when the phase-space density sat-
isfies N\3,/V <1. Under this dilute, high-temperature
condition, the effects of quantum indistinguishability be-
come exponentially suppressed, and Eq. smoothly
reduces to the classical Sackur—Tetrode form.

2. Breakdown of the classical Approximation at low
Temperatures

At sufficiently low temperatures or high densities, the
phase-space density can approach or exceed unity. In
such cases, the gas enters a regime where quantum statis-
tics dominate. For example, ultracold atomic gases
near the Bose-Einstein condensation threshold satisfy
N3,/V > 1, signaling the breakdown of the classical
picture and the necessity of incorporating quantum cor-
rections [56] (58) [59]. In these regimes entropy is no longer
extensive in the classical sense, and indistinguishability,
entanglement, and quantum coherence become essential.

3. When Are Quantum Corrections Necessary?

The importance of quantum corrections in thermody-
namic quantities can be quantified by the dimensionless
phase-space density, N. an /V, where N is the number of
particles, V is the volume, and T is the temperature.
This ratio determines whether the system behaves clas-
sically or quantum mechanically.

When NAZ,/V < 1, the wave packets of in-
dividual particles scarcely overlap, and the classical
Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics provide an excellent ap-
proximation. In contrast, when N. 3 /V > 1, par-
ticle wavefunctions begin to overlap significantly, and
the effects of quantum indistinguishability and exchange
symmetry become non-negligible. In this regime, the
Bose-Einstein or Fermi—Dirac statistics must replace the
classical description [56]. For example, in a typical room-
temperature gas (such as air at T = 300 K and den-
sity n © 2.5 x 10° m3), the ratio NA3,/V is approx-
imately 10-7, confirming that quantum corrections are
completely negligible and the classical limit holds. How-
ever, for an ultracold atomic gas near microkelvin tem-
peratures (T ~ 1 pK), the same parameter can approach
values on the order of 0.3, signaling the onset of quantum
degeneracy where coherence and entanglement effects be-
come dominant.

Therefore, the quantum correction term—manifested
as the 1/N! factor in the partition function or equiv-
alently as the entanglement-induced indistinguishability
entropy—becomes significant only when Ain is compara-
ble to or larger than the mean interparticle spacing. This
condition marks the transition from a classical ensemble
description to a quantum statistical regime [47] [56].

VI. ENTANGLEMENT-BASED DERIVATION
FOR BOSE-EINSTEIN AND FERMI-DIRAC
STATISTICS

We now extend the envariance-based [I] [1] approach
to the grand canonical setting, where the system S' is
in contact with a particle reservoir (chemical poten-
tial 4) and a heat bath (temperature T). The envi-
ronment £ encodes indistinguishability and particle ex-
change symmetry through entanglement. The total sys-
tem-environment state can be written as

ls) = S> Cony l{re}) @ [Bengy),
{nx}

(38)

where n, is the occupation number of mode k, and the en-
vironment records the corresponding configuration {nx}.
We start from the microcanonical description of the total
composite system S consisting of the subsystem S and a
large environment (bath) B.

a. Microcanonical global state and envariance: The
total isolated universe S + B is assumed to be in a mi-
crocanonical state with fixed total energy €,o¢ and total
article number Not. According to the principle of en-
variance [I] [TI], all fine-grained global states within this
energy—particle shell are equally weighted, since swaps
among them can be compensated by unitary transforma-
ions acting on the bath.

b. Subsystem probabilities from bath degeneracy: If
he subsystem S is found in a configuration {n,}, with
otal subsystem energy Es = >), Nxex and particle num-
er Ns = >>, nx, the number of compatible bath states
is given by QB (Etot — Es, Niot — Ns). Because the global
microcanonical amplitudes are equal, the probability of
his subsystem configuration is proportional to the de-
generacy of the bath:

P({ne}) x QB(Evot — Es, Ntot — Ns) (39)

c. Expansion of bath entropy: For a large bath, we
write Qg = e58/*2 and expand the bath entropy to first
order in €g and Ng:

SB(Etot — Es, Ntot — Ns) ~ SB (Etot, Ntot) — BEs + BuNs
(40)
where the thermodynamic parameters of the bath are
defined as
OSB

= (252 = _ (8B
aC mus (Seve a)

Higher-order terms are negligible for macroscopic baths.
d. Emergence of exponential weighting: Substitut-

ing Eq. into Eq. (40) gives

P({nj.}) x exp[ — B(Es — uNs)]. (42)

|

The prefactor eS2/*® is configuration-independent and
absorbed into the normalization constant. This directly
yields the grand-canonical probability distribution,

P({ng}) oc eB Duma len—H) (43)

and, using the Born rule P({nx}) = |Cn,}|?, the corre-
sponding amplitude structure follows as

Cony © exp| = So ng (ex - 1)| (44)
k

e. Interpretation: Thus, the canonical exponential
weighting arises naturally from the envariance of the
global microcanonical state. Envariance ensures equal
weighting of all total system microstates, while the ex-
ponential form for subsystem probabilities emerges from
the entropy gradient of the bath with respect to energy
and particle exchange. The partition function for each
single-particle mode k follows directly from Eq. (4).
In the envariance-based picture, the admissible values
of ny, arise from the symmetry constraints on the sys-
tem-environment state.

f. Occupation-number constraints from envariant
symmetry. In the envariance framework, the exchange
properties of identical particles are not postulated
but arise from the symmetry of the composite sys-
tem-environment state. Let: of) denote the unitary op-
erator that permutes identical particles in the subsystem
S, and 0) the corresponding compensating transfor-
mation on the environment B. Envariance under particle
exchange requires uss) ® ul)

sb) = |Ysg). Tracing
over B yields the reduced condition Tt) ph Ot = ps,
implying that ps is invariant under the action of the per-
mutation group Gy acting on N identical particles. The
physical Hilbert space H'%) of the subsystem thus de-
composes into irreducible subspaces associated with the
symmetry of Gy: HO) = Hsym © Hantisym ® -. » In
three-dimensional space, only the one-dimensional irre-
ducible representations of G ,y—the fully symmetric and
fully antisymmetric sectors—yield physically consistent
particle statistics, corresponding respectively to bosons
and fermions. The symmetric sector allows multiple oc-
cupancy of a single-particle mode (n, = 0,1,2,...), while
antisymmetry under exchange forbids double occupation
(n, € {0,1}). In two-dimensional systems, more general
multi-valued representations of the braid group can oc-
cur, giving rise to anyonic statistics with arbitrary phase
e® (60) (61). Thus, Bose-Einstein and Fermi—Dirac statis-
tics in three dimensions emerge as the only envariance-
permissible exchange symmetries, arising directly from
0 at) |Wse) = |Vse) without any additional com-
binatorial postulate.

g. Mode partition function. Using Eq. (®), the
partition function of a single mode k is Z, =
Dn, expl-Bne(ex — #)|. Evaluating this sum over the
envariance-allowed values of nj, gives

(1—e78(&-))-!, for bosons, nz = 0,1,2,...
Ze =
for fermions, nz = 0,1.
(45)

Thus, the Bose-Einstein and Fermi—Dirac forms emerge
naturally from the same envariance principle that governs
indistinguishability.

h. Average occupation number. The mean number
of particles occupying mode k is given by the standard
statistical definition:

1 F
(ng) = Zz Ss ny @ OME (ER-H) (46)

Nk

(1+ e-Blea-0)),

Performing the sum using the allowed nx, values for each
case yields the following:

1

1

(Bose-Einstein),
(nk) = (47)

(Fermi-Dirac).
i. Interpretation. In this framework, the difference

between Bose-Einstein and Fermi—Dirac statistics orig-
inates from distinct envariance symmetries of the total
system-environment state. Symmetric envariance allows
collective occupation (bosons), while antisymmetric en-
variance enforces exclusion (fermions). Therefore, the
occupation-number statistics and the associated parti-
tion functions [Eqs. 7)| emerge naturally from
the quantum-information structure of indistinguishabil-
ity, without invoking separate combinatorial postulates
as in classical statistical mechanics [62] [63].

VII. SAHA EQUATION WITH
ENTANGLEMENT-INDUCED
INDISTINGUISHABILITY

We revisit the Saha equilibrium for the reaction [20\{61]
H=p*+e, (48)

and explicitly derive the modified relation incorporating
the quantum entanglement correction that enforces in-
distinguishability through system-environment correla-
tions.

A. Standard Saha equation without quantum
correction

For nondegenerate ideal species, the chemical poten-
tial follows from the canonical partition function of an
indistinguishable gas,

nid? Qnh?
i = kn Tin( : Vs M=\oager 9)

where n;, gi, and A; denote number density, internal de-
generacy, and thermal wavelength, respectively. Chemi-
cal equilibrium, juz = Hp + He, yields

with E; the ionization energy. Approximating my ~

B. Quantum-entanglement correction

In a fully quantum description, electrons and pro-
tons remain distinguishable by intrinsic quantum num-
bers such as charge and mass. However, within each
species, individual particles (all electrons or all protons)
are indistinguishable due to envariance under their mu-
tual permutations. The environment effectively records
only the exchange information among identical particles
of the same type. Thus, permutation-equivalent configu-
rations of electrons (or protons) correspond to orthogonal

environment states |£,), ensuring proper symmetrization
within each species without conflating physically distinct
particle types. The total system—environment state can
then be written as

1
|Wsez) = Naw py |H,p,e) @|Ex), (52)

where the sum runs over all particle permutations within
each species. Tracing out the environmental degrees of

freedom removes permutation information, so that the
number of accessible system microstates is reduced by

1
ent _ ' , 2
ind = IND where Ni = niV (53)
This factor represents an entanglement-induced indistin-
guishability correction: the environment enforces permu-
tation symmetry, identifying previously overcounted mi-
crostates. The associated entanglement entropy is

Sent = —kg n PSs = kp In(N!N,!), (54)

which quantifies the information loss due to tracing over
permutation records. Since Sent «x InN!, it is weakly
(sublinearly) dependent on system size and hence non-
extensive, consistent with its interpretation as an infor-
mational correction rather than a thermodynamic en-
ropy. The corresponding free-energy correction arises
from the standard relation AF = —T AS. However,
because Sent scales as In N, the change ASent per particle
becomes negligible in the thermodynamic limit, ensuring
chat the total free energy remains extensive. Thus, AF
should be interpreted as a small additive offset that cor-
rects the classical free energy for quantum indistinguisha-
bility, not as an extensive contribution.

In summary, the envariance-induced factor Te"! in-
roduces a logarithmic (non-extensive) entropy correc-
ion that removes the classical overcounting of identical
configurations while preserving the extensivity of macro-
scopic thermodynamic quantities such as total free en-
ergy and entropy.

C. Modified Saha Relation

a. Entanglement-induced indistinguishability correc-
tion. In the envariance-based description, indistin-
guishability among identical particles arises dynamically
through entanglement with the environment. Tracing
out the environmental degrees of freedom that record
particle permutations reduces the effective number of
microstates by Eq. This modifies the entropy by

Sent = —kg mTe*s, leading to a free-energy shift
AF = -T ASen: = —keT In TS". (55)
Hence, the equilibrium constant is renormalized as

Kguantum = Ketassicall’ $24, yielding the modified Saha re-
lation:

Rpte (Pamehe | ae e7Ei/(keT) pent (56)
fin he Gu ind

Equation reduces to the classical form in the dilute
limit ([¢"{ 1), while at higher densities (Te"{ <1) it pre-
dicts a suppression of ionization due to the entanglement-
enforced indistinguishability of identical particles within
each species. This expression therefore represents a first-
principles, quantum-information-based generalization of
the Saha equilibrium, with potential implications for
dense astrophysical plasmas and recombination-era cos-

ization fraction is suppressed.

VIII. RESULTS

This study establishes a quantum-mechanical founda-
tion for the fundamental laws of statistical mechanics us-
ing the principle of envariance. The main results are
summarized below:

1. Derivation of Core Statistical Distributions:
By applying the envariance framework [i] [II] to a
system of N entangled qubits [13], we derived the
binomial distribution P(n) = of p"(1—p)X—™ di-
rectly from the symmetry of system—environment
correlations. The special case of maximal entan-
glement (p = 1/2) yields equal probabilities for all
outcomes, while the general non-maximal case (rep-
resented through an auxiliary Hilbert space) repro-
duces Born’s rule [11][32]. In the appropriate limits
(N00, p-+0), this result continuously transitions
into the Poisson P(n) = \"e~*/n! and Gaussian
distributions, providing a unified quantum origin

or classical statistics.

2. Quantitative Resolution of the Gibbs Para-
dox: The Gibbs paradox [8] [18] [19] was resolved
y invoking the quantum indistinguishability [57]
of identical particles. We showed that the classical
entropy of mixing is exactly cancelled by a von Neu-
mann entropy term, Sent = kg In(N!), which arises
from the entanglement between the system’s per-
mutation states and an observer’s information. The
relevance of this quantum correction was quantified
y the dimensionless parameter NA}, /V [471 56).
Our calculations confirmed that this parameter is
negligible for a room-temperature gas (~ 1077)
ut significant for an ultracold atomic gas (~ 0.3),

10

hereby defining the classical-to-quantum transi-

10n.
3. Emergence of Bose-Einstein and
Fermi—Dirac Distributions: Extending

he envariance principle to the grand canon-
ical ensemble reveals that quantum statistics
emerge directly from system-environment ex-
change symmetry. For a composite state
Use) = VenyCtn3l{re}) ® |Eqn,}), invari-
ance under local unitaries acting on S requires
the amplitudes Cin,} « exp -£3,,ne(ex — p)):
This symmetry leads directly to the probability
distribution P({ng}) x e7F Ue *(ee-H), and hence
© the Bose-Einstein and Fermi—Dirac occupation
numbers (nx) = 1/[e%*-“) + 1) [67 68]. Thus,
quantum statistics are shown to originate from en-
variance under particle exchange, without invoking
any additional postulates.

4. Quantum Correction to the Saha Equa-

tion: Incorporating indistinguishability through
environment-induced entanglement yields a modi-
fied Saha relation for ionization equilibrium [20] [69]
as shown in Eq. (54) where Ting = 1/(Ne! Np!) is
an entanglement-induced indistinguishability fac-
tor. This multiplicative suppression term reduces
the effective ionization fraction at high densities,
consistent with Pauli exclusion and exchange sym-
metry. In the dilute (classical) limit Ty,4q > 1, re-
covering the conventional Saha equation, while in
dense or degenerate regimes the correction becomes
non-negligible, extending the applicability of the
Saha equilibrium to quantum plasmas and ultra-
cold gases.
This picture is consistent with the emerging
resource-theoretic and typicality approaches [70}
[74] which regard entropy and thermalization as
consequences of information constraints.

IX. DISCUSSION

The results presented in this paper offer a significant
shift in perspective, moving the foundations of statistical
mechanics from a postulate-based framework to a deduc-
tive theory grounded in quantum mechanics. The central
implication is that statistical laws are not merely abstract
rules for dealing with ignorance but are direct physi-
cal consequences of the way quantum information [13]
is structured and processed through entanglement [I] [TJ]
with an environment.

Our derivation of the core ensembles [47] via envari-
ance reframes the role of the observer and the environ-
ment. Instead of an external agent postulating prob-
abilities, the environment actively enforces the statis-
tical rules. The equiprobability of the microcanonical
ensemble arises from the maximal symmetry of a

system-environment state, while the exponential form o
the canonical ensemble [I] emerges as the statistically in-
evitable outcome for any small part of that larger whole.
This provides a physical mechanism for thermalization
and equilibrium, rooted in the flow and distribution o
uantum information [13].

The unified derivation of the binomial, Poisson, and
Gaussian distributions [47] from a single quantum-
mechanical model highlights the predictive power and
internal consistency of this approach. It demonstrates
that the statistics governing discrete events (like parti-
le counts) and continuous variables are not independent
phenomena, but are different facets of the same underly-
ing quantum reality. This unification reinforces the idea
that classical probability theory is an emergent feature
of a more fundamental quantum information theory (7).
Furthermore, the resolution of the Gibbs paradox [8]
{18} [19] through entanglement [I] entropy provides more
than just a fix for a classical problem. It offers a quan-
titative tool, the parameter NA},/V, [47] [56] to delin-
eate the boundary between the classical and quantum
worlds. Our numerical examples for air versus ultra-
cold atomic gas make this transition tangible, showing
that the “paradox” is simply the breakdown of a clas-
sical approximation in a regime where quantum effects,
ecifically entanglement due to indistinguishability [57],
cannot be ignored.

It is important to acknowledge the idealizations usec
in our models, such as the assumption of non-interacting
particles in the Gibbs paradox derivation [8] {18} [19] anc
perfectly orthogonal environment states. Future work
hould explore the extension of this envariance-based
framework [1] to strongly interacting systems, where
correlations can lead to new statistical phenomena and
phase transitions [47] [56]. Investigating the effects of im-
perfect environmental coupling and decoherence would

also provide a more realistic picture of how statistical
equilibrium is reached in open quantum systems. Fi-
nally, the success of this approach suggests its potential
applicability to other longstanding problems where infor-
mation, gravity, and thermodynamics intersect [69], such
as the black hole information paradox.
This work establishes that the fundamental principles
of statistical mechanics [47] emerge naturally from quan-
tum foundations, eliminating the need for phenomeno-
logical postulates. By employing the concept of envari-
ance {I} - asymmetry property of entangled quantum
systems - we have derived the core framework of statisti-
cal physics from first principles. Our approach reveals
that the microcanonical and canonical ensembles [47],
along with their characteristic probability distributions,
are direct consequences of quantum information dynam-
ics rather than axiomatic assumptions.

The key insight unifying our results is that thermody-
namic behavior [13] arises from the information-theoretic
properties of quantum systems interacting with their en-
vironment. This perspective provides a natural resolu-
tion to the Gibbs paradox [8] [18] [19] through entangle-

11

ment entropy, while simultaneously explaining the emer-
gence of classical statistical distributions from quantum
measurement processes. The quantum corrections we de-
rive for the Saha equation [20] [69] further demonstrate
how this framework extends beyond textbook statisti-
cal mechanics to predict observable phenomena in quan-
tum many-body systems [44]. These findings fundamen-
tally reshape our understanding of statistical physics by
demonstrating that:

1) Thermodynamic laws are emergent consequences of
quantum information.

2) Classical paradoxes disappear when proper account
is taken of quantum correlations.

3) The boundary between quantum and classical sta-
tistical behavior can be precisely quantified.

Looking forward, this quantum foundations approach
opens new avenues for understanding complex systems
where information, thermodynamics, and quantum dy-
namics intersect. The methods developed here may find
application in areas ranging from quantum thermody-
namics to the study of emergent phenomena in con-
densed matter systems. Most significantly, our results
complete the conceptual unification of mechanics and
thermodynamics that began with Boltzmann’s pioneer-
ing work, revealing both to be aspects of a deeper quan-
tum information-theoretic [44]. Recent work in quantum
thermodynamics and decoherence supports this envari-

ance framework [4] [16] [36] [37] [75].
