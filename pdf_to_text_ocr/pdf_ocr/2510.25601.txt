Building on previous studies that demonstrated the applicability of a fluid-dynamic description
of charm quarks in the quark-gluon plasma [1, 2], the present work extends the framework by
computing the out-of-equilibrium contributions to the distribution function of charm hadrons. The
analysis includes corrections arising from the initial out-of-equilibrium distribution of charm quarks
after a free-streaming phase, as well as from the freeze-out surface within fluid dynamics. These
results enable the exact computation of integrated yields and transverse momentum distributions of
charm hadrons for different values of the spatial diffusion coefficient, thereby providing the basis for a
systematic determination of the charm transport coefficients. In addition, the limits of applicability
of the approach are identified by determining the transverse-momentum region in which charm
hadrons are described by a well-defined, positive distribution function.

I. INTRODUCTION

Charm quarks represent unique probes to study the properties of the hot and dense QCD medium produced
in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Since their mass is significantly larger than

medium.

quark dynamics in the QGP was developed in our previous works [1, 2].

Assuming proximity to local thermal equilibrium, we applied in Ref. [1] a simplified version of the method of

he typical temperature of the QGP reached in nuclear collision experiments, charm quarks are produced almost
exclusively in the initial stage via hard partonic scatterings, and their thermal production in the fireball is exponentially
suppressed [3]. Moreover, due to their scarce abundance in the medium, the charm-quark annihilation rate can be
considered negligible within the QGP lifetime [3, 4]. Thus, the initial production effective

This supported the applicability of fluid-dynamic descriptions, and a fluid-dynamic framework for charm

This approach, however, does not provide a straightforward parametrization of the corresponding correc-

harm-hadron distribution functions on the freeze-out hypersurface, which we have neglected until now.

Out-of-equilibrium corrections at freeze-out are crucial for accurately describing charm-hadron yields and momen-
ra. Neglecting them led to an unphysical dependence of charm multiplicities on the heavy-quark spatial
diffusion coefficient D,. The D, coefficient characterizes the low-momentum interaction strength of heavy quarks in
the medium, and it encodes the spatial broadening of the heavy quarks. As a result, our previous work [2] did not allow
for a systematic study of charm-hadron spectra or for the constraint of the value of the D, coefficient. In addition,
charm-quark distribution function was assumed to be in local thermal equilibrium, neglecting the influence

uilibrium corrections at the freeze-out is given, employing a multi-species approach. After
presenting the evolution of the charm fields in Sec. III, we discuss in Sec. IV the results on the charm hadron yields and
transverse momentum (pr) spectra. Finally, Sec. V focuses on the limit of the applicability of our model, exploring
the upper bound of the transverse momentum up to which our approach is reliable.

II. CHARM OUT-OF-EQUILIBRIUM CORRECTIONS

In kinetic theory, the state of a system is described by the single-particle distribution function f,, which encodes
the phase-space density of a particle with momentum p. Under dissipative conditions, the distribution function is
usually decomposed into a local-equilibrium contribution AO, and an out-of-equilibrium correction 6 fp,

fp = £O - Ofp- (1)

This decomposition implicitly assumes that 6 fp is a perturbative correction to the local-equilibrium distribution,
such that |b fp| << rw and higher-order corrections beyond linear order can be neglected. At the microscopic level, the
fluid dynamic quantities can be expressed as moments of the distribution function. Taking as an example the density
of a particle species and its associated diffusion current, in the Landau frame they can be expressed respectively as,

a= Gaye f Pes”. @)

1 Bp io ,

where in the rest frame of the fluid p° coincides with the particle energy, obeying the on-shell condition p° = Ey =
\/p? + M2, for a particle of mass M. Moreover, here the notation A“” = g#” + uu” is employed to represent the
projection operator onto the subspace orthogonal to the fluid four-velocity u!.

In fluid dynamics, the deviation from local thermal equilibrium is macroscopically quantified by considering the
ratio between the dissipative quantities and the equilibrium ones, defined as the inverse of Reynolds number. In the
case of diffusion processes, the inverse of the Reynolds number reads,

Since the non-equilibrium moments are defined as integrals over J fp, while the equilibrium ones are obtained from
the equilibrium distribution, Eq. (4) provides a quantitative measure of the deviations from local equilibrium.
While the equilibrium distribution can be parametrized using a Maxwell-Jiittner distribution, in the following the
calculation of the out-of-equilibrium corrections to the charm distribution function, both at the initial stage of the
collision and at freeze-out, is discussed.

A. Charm out-of-equilibrium corrections: initial stage

In the present section, we introduce an approach for modeling charm quark out-of-equilibrium corrections at the
initial stage of the collision, with particular emphasis on the initialization of the diffusion current.

The density at mid-rapidity of charm—anticharm pairs produced in hard scattering processes at their formation
time 7; can be written as,

section per unit of rapidity at mid rapidity computed with perturbative-QCD (pQCD) calculations from FONLL [18].

While Eq. (5) is valid for any system in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, this work focuses on Pb-Pb collisions at

VJ5NN = 5.02 TeV within the 0-10% centrality class. Thus, we consider o'* = 70 mb [19] and adopt the pQCD

prediction using CTEQ6.6 Parton Distribution Function (PDF) [20], which yields do@@ /dy = 0.463 mb. It was

shown in Refs. [21, 22] that the charm production cross section measured in pp collisions at the LHC systematically
lies on the upper edge of the FONLL calculations across several center-of-mass energies. Similar deviations are
expected in Pb—Pb collisions, implying that the use of the FONLL cross section in the present calculation may lead
to an underestimation of the number of produced cé pairs. The choice of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and
their possible nuclear modifications further affect the charm production cross section and, consequently, the initial
charm yield. In the absence of a direct measurement of the charm cross section in Pb—Pb collisions, however, the
FONLLE calculation is adopted. A systematic study of the charm-quark cross section, possibly employing a Bayesian
analysis, is left for future work. The density of binary collisions no (7) in the transverse plane is computed with the
TRENTo model [23] and depends on the impact parameter of the collision. The formation time 7; accounts for the
pure longitudinal expansion at early times, commonly referred to as Bjorken flow [24]'.

The initialization of the charm density and diffusion is concurrent with the beginning of a fluid description for the
QGP. Therefore, one exploits the definition of a temperature and a chemical potential to identify an equilibrium and
an out-of-equilibrium component of the charm quark distribution function. The heavy-quark differential production
cross section can be decomposed as,

0 6

The terms on the RHS of Eg. (6) correspond to the equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium production cross section,
respectively. The equilibrium contribution can be obtained by an appropriately normalized equilibrium distribution
function at the same temperature of the medium, and the out-of-equilibrium describes the difference between the
total differential cross section and the equilibrium one. The total differential cross section appearing in the LHS is
obtained from FONLL calculations as a function of the transverse momentum.

By employing Landau matching conditions, and imposing that the density of charm quarks produced in the hard
scattering processes is fixed to be equal to the thermal equilibrium density, one can obtain an expression for the charm
equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium distribution function in terms of the differential cross section,

Between the production time 7; and the hydrodynamic initialization time 7, charm quarks can be assumed to
free-stream without interactions’. In this approach, no free-streaming stage is applied to the bulk medium, whose
initial temperature profile and fluid velocity will be specified in the next section. In the free-streaming scenario,
where particles travel in straight-line trajectories, kinetic equations can be solved exactly by using the method of
characteristics [28] and the expression for the distribution function in terms of the free-streamed coordinates is
known analytically. Thus, applying free-streaming to the distribution functions in Eq. (7) and (8) leaves the physical
quantities depending only on the momentum, such as the production cross section, unaffected, while it influences
those that depend on the spatial coordinates, as the density of binary collisions. After the free-streaming phase, at
time 79, the charm-quark diffusion current can be expressed as,

where p” is the time-component of the four momentum in Milne coordinates. We highlight that for symmetry reasons
the diffusion current is zero at the formation time of heavy quarks 7;. However, the dependence of neo on py and py,
due to the free-streaming, yields a non-zero diffusion current at time 79.

Figure 1 shows the radial component of the diffusion current (left panel) and of the charm density (right panel)
before and after free-streaming, considering 7; = 0.1 fm/c (dashed line) and 7 = 0.4 fm/c (solid line), for the 0-10%
central Pb-Pb collisions at \/snn = 5.02 TeV. The initial production time of charm quarks is set according to the

1 Notice that since we are considering an initial Bjorken flow, the space-time rapidity 7 coincides with the momentum rapidity y. Therefore,
the production cross section will be expressed in the following per unit of momentum rapidity. For notational convenience, we will drop
in what follows the explicit indication of mid-rapidity. Notice, however, that the production cross sections are all calculated at y = 0.

2 In heavy-ion collisions, the earliest stage is described within the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) framework [25]. Although free-streaming
provides a simplified treatment of this stage, recent studies indicate that glasma effects on charm-quark transport are moderate, leading
to only limited modifications of charm observables [26, 27], supporting the use of free-streaming as a reasonable approximation for
early-time charm dynamics.

timescale for producing a charm—anticharm pair, as estimated from the uncertainty principle. After free-streaming,
the charm quarks develop a non-zero diffusion current, whose amplitude is comparable to that produced at late times
T ~ 10 fm/c, as reported in our previous work [2]. The influence of the initial diffusion on the evolution of v/!
is investigated in detail in Sec. III. The density of charm quarks peaks at the center of the fireball and decreases
smoothly with distance, until at r > 8 fm the number of produced charm quarks becomes negligible. Notice that
after the free-streaming phase, the density profile decreases due to the Bjorken expansion along the longitudinal axis.
Nevertheless, the number of charm quarks remains conserved in time due to the buildup of the diffusion current.

B. Charm out-of-equilibrium corrections: freeze-out

In the current section, the derivation of the out-of-equilibrium corrections for charm hadrons at freeze-out, and the
computation of transport coefficients for each charm-hadron species, are presented. For this purpose, a multi-species
approach, as introduced in Ref. [29], is employed, and a fluid composed of all the charm hadrons in the Hadron
Resonance Gas of charm (HRGc), interacting with the light components of the QGP, is considered. This is a valid
description of the QCD medium when the system is close to the pseudo-critical temperature, and the partonic degrees
of freedom convert into the hadronic ones. However, in the absence of a charm Equation of State (EoS) that smoothly
interpolates between the two regimes, the charm hadronic description is employed for the whole temperature range
of the system evolution.

The thermodynamic quantities of the mixture, as the charm-quark number density and the charm diffusion current,
are expressed as a summation over the species i in the HRGc, weighted by their net charm charge qi,

Ng = Ss Gri, ve = Ss qv. (10)
i€HRGe i€HRGe

In the following, all the quantities characterized by the index i refer to the hadron species i, while the fields denoted
as nq and vf are associated with the total-charm dynamics.

1. The Fokker-Planck Equation

Assuming small momentum exchange between charm hadrons and the light partons of the medium, and considering
an isotropic medium, the dynamics of charm hadrons reduces to the well-known Fokker-Planck equation,

a er,
Phe =P pa {Al fin +O" Disa hio} (11)

where |,m = 1,2,3 represent the three spatial components. The coefficients A; and Dj, called respectively drag and
momentum-diffusion coefficients, encode the interaction of the i-th charm hadron with the light components, and are
related by the Einstein fluctuation-dissipation (EFD) relation [30],

as Di
~ TE,

A; (12)
In Eq. (11), A; and D; are assumed for simplicity to be independent of the charm-hadron momentum, similarly to
Ref. [1].

The spatial diffusion coefficient D, is identified as the asymptotic mean squared displacement of an ensemble of
particles initially placed at the origin of the coordinate system. In the case of charm quark dynamics in the QGP, D,
characterizes the long-wavelength properties of the transport of the charm-quark number through QCD matter, and,
as long as the dynamics is non-relativistic, it can be expressed as,

EL

Ds = za?
“— A(p = 0)M’

(13)
where M represents the mass of the charm quark, while A is its respective friction coefficient. Being able to capture
the charm-quark coupling with the medium at low transverse momenta, the spatial diffusion coefficient is of particular
interest in phenomenological studies. In the current study, the diffusion coefficient is considered to be the same for
charm quarks and each charm hadron species, and Eq. (13) to hold in both cases. This choice reflects the idea that
hadronic transport properties inherit the underlying charm—medium coupling.

2. Charm-hadrons out-of-equilibrium corrections

To study the out-of-equilibrium corrections of charm hadrons at freeze-out, and following Ref. [29], the irreducible
moment of tensor rank / for each hadron species is defined as a moment of the out-of-equilibrium distribution function,

It can be shown that the out-of-equilibrium corrections can be expanded as a series of irreducible moments with
()

coefficients a;”,

where the notation py, --Py,) = Abit) p’!...p”' indicates the orthogonal component of the momentum with respect
to the fluid velocity. Typically, the expansion in Eq. (15) is truncated at rank | = 2, in order to account for the
lowest-order irreducible moments explicitly appearing in the energy-momentum tensor T” and the conserved current
N{. However, bulk pressure and shear-stress contributions from the charm hadrons are assumed to be negligible with
respect to those associated with the light components. For this reason, as a first approximation, we consider only the
term associated with the diffusion current, corresponding to 1 = 1. Notice that by the definition of diffusion current
in Eq. (3), the irreducible moment of rank 1 corresponds to the diffusion current of the charm hadron of species i, i.e.
p} =v. Starting from the Boltzmann equation and employing the Navier-Stokes approximation, a first-order linear
relation is established between the first irreducible moment p/' and the total charm diffusion current v/' [29],

pf = Rv + O(2), (16)

where the normalized diffusion coefficient is defined as,

i= ——————_.. (17)
, jeHRGe gph

Notice that here all terms that are quadratic in the inverse Reynolds number are neglected, assuming R7>! < 1. This
approximation is valid only in the limit of small contributions of vf to the total charm conserved current of N/’. The
validity of this approximation will be discussed further in the next sections.

Adapting the calculation of Ref. [1] to our multi-species approach, it is possible to express the expansion coefficient
as a = 1/P;, where P; represents the pressure contribution of each charm hadron. Thus, the out-of-equilibrium
correction of the charm hadron of species i reads,

. ol. -¢
Shap = fap BRM PW): (18)
Equation (18) constitutes a key result of the present work, and represents the first attempt to parametrize the out-of-
equilibrium corrections of charm hadrons within our fluid-dynamic approach. The expression of 6f;,, reduces to the
one found in Ref. [1] if we consider a fluid composed of a single particle species, marking the consistency between the
wo approaches. Notice that the out-of-equilibrium correction to each charm hadron depends on the total diffusion
current of the charm quark vi. This result represents a practical advantage, as in our framework, only the total
diffusion current needs to be evolved, instead of one for each hadron species.

The corrections expressed by Eq. (18) are valid only in the limit R>' «< 1. Since the pressure of each hadron can
e expressed in terms of its density, P; = niT, the out-of-equilibrium corrections are proportional to the ratio of the
diffusion current to the density. When R7! ~ 1, the out-of-equilibrium corrections become comparable in magnitude
o the equilibrium distribution, and the underlying assumption is no longer valid. Since the radial component of
he diffusion current in our framework exhibits a negative profile (see Sec. III), the corrections can assume negative

values; therefore, when |dfi,p| ~ £2, the total charm-hadron distribution function may become negative, losing its
interpretation as a physical probability distribution. This clearly sets a limit to the applicability of our approach,
which will be discussed in Sec. V.

8. Charm hadron transport coefficients

The expression of 6f;,, reported in Eq. (18) is directly proportional to the diffusion coefficient «; of the charm
hadron of species 7. To obtain an expression for the charm-hadron transport coefficients, we consider successive
moments of Eq. (11). The 0" moment encodes the continuity equation for the hadron i. Taking the first moment,
an equation of motion for the diffusion current of each charm hadron v/" naturally arises,

factor, set to one in Ref. [1].

Ill. EVOLUTION OF CHARM FLUID FIELDS

Considering the statistical azimuthal symmetry and longitudinal boost invariance of high-energy heavy-ion collisions,
a 1+1D description is adopted, where the fluid fields depend only on the proper time 7 and the radial coordinate
r. Under this approximation, the fluid dynamics is governed by five independent fields: the temperature, the radial
component of the fluid four-velocity, two components of the shear-stress tensor, and the bulk viscous pressure. The

0 be Tyo = 156 MeV [12].

The yield per unit of rapidity om of each charm hadron is obtained by integrating Eq. (25) in a pr range from 0
o 10 GeV/c. The conserved number of charm quarks produced in the QGP redistributes among the various charm-
hadron species at freeze-out according to their thermal weights. Consequently, the integrated yield of charm hadrons
is expected to be independent of the value of D,T.

To validate the expression for the charm-hadron out-of-equilibrium correction in Eq. (18), a toy model is first
considered, consisting of a gas composed of a single charm hadron, the D° meson. Within this simplified scenario,
he number of charm quarks in the QGP is expected to match the multiplicity of D° mesons produced at freeze-out.
The left panel of Fig. 3 shows the invariant yield of D° mesons as a function of the spatial diffusion coefficient D.T,
varied within the range predicted in Ref. [15]. Comparisons are made between the non-diffusive case (blue markers)
and the diffusive case, considering separately the equilibrium and the out-of-equilibrium contributions (green and red
markers, respectively), as well as the total distribution function (orange markers). The D® yield is also compared to
he total number of charm quarks (black dashed line) produced at the beginning of the collision. The spatial diffusion
coefficient governs the evolution of v#, such that higher values of D,T produce larger out-of-equilibrium corrections
(see Sec. IIB 3). Neglecting 6f;,p results in an unphysical dependence of the hadron multiplicity on D,T. By including
he out-of-equilibrium corrections, the invariant yield is comparable with both the non-diffusive case and the total
number of charm quarks in the QGP across the entire range of D,.T. This agreement confirms the validity of the
arametrization of the out-of-equilibrium corrections. Notice that the corrections contribute negatively to the total

yield, counterbalancing the unphysical enhancement observed for fee only, and are thus reported here in absolute
value. The out-of-equilibrium fraction of the invariant yield does not exceed the equilibrium one throughout the whole
range of D,T probed, even if their ratio increases due to the proportionality of 6 f;,) on the spatial diffusion coefficient.
Notice that the df;,) linearly depends on the transverse momentum. However, given that the largest fraction of the
invariant yield arises from the low-pr region, we observe that the contribution to the yield from the equilibrium part
of the distribution function exceeds the out-of-equilibrium one for any investigated value of D,T’. For the largest value
of D,T tested, ie. D,T = 0.24, the ratio between the contributions reaches a value of around 40%.

A gas composed of all hadrons in the HRGc is further considered, and the right panel of Fig. 3 shows the multiplicity
of the most abundant charm-hadron species for D,T’ = 0.24, including contributions from all resonance decays.
Comparisons are made between the non-diffusive case (blue solid line) and the diffusive case, both with (orange dashed
line) and without (green dotted line) out-of-equilibrium corrections. The inclusion of out-of-equilibrium corrections
makes the multiplicity compatible with the one obtained in the non-diffusive case for all the charm hadrons considered.

The parametrization of the out-of-equilibrium corrections enables the study of charm-hadron pr spectra for different
values of D,T. Figure 4 presents the charm-hadron invariant spectrum for the non-diffusive case (blue solid line) and

line) out-of-equilibrium corrections. The value of the spatial diffusion coefficient clearly influences the shape of the
invariant spectrum while keeping the charm-hadron multiplicity constant. We notice here that the out-of-equilibrium
corrections are positive for pr < 2 GeV/c for both values of D,T considered. For D,T = 0.24, the momentum
spectrum becomes negative at around pp ~ 2 GeV/c. This behavior occurs because in this pr region, the out-of-
equilibrium corrections exceed the equilibrium contribution in magnitude. Consequently, the current model provides a
physically meaningful description only within a limited range of spatial diffusion coefficient values. Other approaches
that maintain a positive distribution function across the entire considered regime, such as the maximum entropy
approach [38], will be explored in future works.

Vv. ON THE ONSET OF CHARM NUMBER FLUID DYNAMICS

Negative hadron momentum spectra above a certain pp can be expected in fluid dynamic models. As a matter
of fact, fluid dynamic fields correspond to moments of the distribution function, and the reconstruction of fp from
the former is reliable only within the radius of convergence of the associated Taylor series. In the current section,
an estimate is provided for the transverse momentum up to which the charm-hadron momentum spectrum remains
positive, ensuring the validity of the current approximation.

Employing thermodynamic relations and the definition of the normalized diffusion coefficient, the total charm-
hadron distribution function can be expressed as,

‘ 1 i ,
fin = £9 [ (z) Sem Hin (26)

As observed in the left panel of Fig. 2, the diffusion current exhibits negative values in the spatial domain explored
by the fireball. Therefore, there can be regions on the freeze-out surface where the out-of-equilibrium corrections
are negative, possibly exceeding in magnitude the equilibrium component. There can therefore be three different

scenarios:

e The total distribution function is positive on the entire freeze-out surface, and therefore its definition of physical
probability distribution holds for any value of pr. This automatically yields positively defined momentum

distributions of charm hadrons;
e The total distribution function is negative on a portion of the freeze-out surface, but the positive contribution
exceeds in magnitude the negative one. Therefore, after computing the freeze-out integration, one obtains a
positive value for the pr distribution;

e The total distribution function is negative on a portion of the freeze-out surface, and the positive contribution is
smaller in magnitude than the negative one. Therefore, after computing the freeze-out integration, one obtains
a negative value for the pr distribution.

VI. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

This work presents an approach to compute the out-of-equilibrium corrections to the charm-quark distribution
function, both during the initial stage of heavy-ion collisions and at the freeze-out.

At the initial stage, charm quarks are assumed to undergo a free-streaming phase between their production and
the beginning of the fluid dynamics description. Employing Landau matching conditions and decomposing the charm
production cross section into equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium components, an expression for the charm out-of-
equilibrium distribution function can be determined. The free-streaming stage generates a non-vanishing diffusion
current at the beginning of the hydrodynamic evolution; however, this initial contribution is found to have little impact
on the subsequent evolution of the charm-quark fields, which at late times remain comparable to those obtained for
v"(T,7) = 0.

The out-of-equilibrium corrections at freeze-out are parametrized within a multi-species approach, decomposing
he charm-quark fields into the individual contributions of each charm hadron species in the HRGc. This procedure
allows the derivation of the out-of-equilibrium corrections of each charm hadron. Incorporating these corrections at
reeze-out enables a consistent computation of the invariant yields. In particular, it was observed that neglecting 6 fip
roduces an unphysical dependence of the charm hadron multiplicity on D,T, while including the corrections restores
compatibility with the non-diffusive case across the entire D,T range explored, thereby confirming the validity of our
ramework.

The present approach to compute the out-of-equilibrium corrections relies on the assumption that |d fp| << FO, an
approximation that breaks down at large values of the spatial diffusion coefficient or at high transverse momentum.
n practice, the charm-hadron momentum spectra are observed to become negative beyond a certain value of pr
and/or D,T, which sets a limit on the applicability of the framework. Future developments may explore alternative
methods that guarantee positivity of the distribution function across the full pr range, such as the maximum entropy
approach proposed in Ref. [38]. This advancement will enable future constraints on the charm diffusion coefficient and
he charm production cross section, if not yet experimentally measured, through, for example, a Bayesian analysis of
experimental data.

Appendix A: Equation of motion for the total-charm diffusion current

In this section, we find an expression for the equation of motion obeyed by the total-charm diffusion current v/. As
reported in Eq. (16), under Navier-Stokes approximation, there exists a linear relation between the rank-1 irreducible
moment p/' and the charm quark diffusion current,

py = Riv + O(2). (Al)

Even if this relation was obtained in Navier-Stokes approximation, when we exploit this expression in the equation of
motion of p/', all the O(2) terms will become O(3) terms, and thus can be neglected.
The equation of motion for the rank-1 irreducible moment reported in Ref. [29] reads,

Tipit + pl = KiV"¥ ag + O(2). (A2)

Starting from this equation, one can plug in the expression for v/' in Eq. (Al), multiply by the charm charge q; of
each species, and perform a summation over all the charm-hadron species in the HRGc,

where we employed the definition of the normalized diffusion coefficient &;, and thus >; q@iki = So, a a  ~=l

Moreover, we exploited that vf = Ae) since by definition the diffusion current is perpendicular to the velocity.

Eq. (A3) represents the equation of motion for the charm quark, where the relaxation time and the diffusion coefficient
are given by a summation of the contributions of each hadron, each weighted by the charm charge q; belonging to the
charm hadron of species i. Plugging in the expression for charm-hadron transport coefficients reported in Eq. (20)
and Eq. (21), one finds that the total-charm diffusion current obeys the relaxation-type equation of motion expressed

Appendix B: Study on the integrand of the distribution function

In this section, we study the argument of the integral of the particle momentum spectrum to assess its sign and
determine the regime of pr where our model is applicable. From Eq. (25), it is possible to analytically perform
the integration over the spatial rapidity 1 and the azimuthal angle ¢. Considering the equilibrium contribution and
neglecting the influence of resonance decays, the invariant momentum spectrum can be expressed as,

dN? 2 O . oO .
Bp — aa [ der(a)r(a) [Ferme (mu) Ip (Bru’) — ayPrko (mu) Ty (pru’)} e&, (B1)
where we introduced the freeze-out coordinate a = arctan(tj,/rT4.), and we defined mp = " and pr = ™. The
functions Jj(2) and K)(x) are modified Bessel functions of order | of the first and second kind, respectively. Similarly,
the out-of-equilibrium contribution can be expressed as,

Therefore, the integrand of the momentum spectrum reduces to functions of the transverse momentum pr and of a.
The dependence of the fluid fields on a is a numerical result of the fluid dynamic evolution.

In Fig. 6, the integrand of the momentum spectrum of D° mesons, including both the equilibrium and out-of-
equilibrium contributions, is shown as a heatmap in the (pr, a) plane. In the left panel, the case of D.T = 0.24
is considered. We observe that, in agreement with what is reported in Fig. 4, the integrand of the distribution
function becomes predominantly negative for pp = 2 GeV/c, causing the total momentum spectrum to be negative.
However, the integrand assumes negative values at small pr as well. Being negative within a limited region in a,
his behavior is not observed when computing the momentum spectrum, where the integration over the freeze-out
coordinate a is performed. Remarkably, the integrand assumes negative values also at py = 0, where the contribution
of the out-of-equilibrium corrections vanishes. To clarify this behavior, we report in the right panel of Fig 6 the
integrand of the equilibrium distribution function, corresponding to the case of D,T = 0. Here, the integrand of
he momentum spectrum is negative in a region at low py and low a. This behavior cannot be associated with the
equilibrium distribution function, since it is positive definite, but rather with the shape of the freeze-out hypersurface.
As a matter of fact, since the freeze-out occurs on a constant-temperature hypersurface, the sign of Or/Oa is not
ositive-definite, and specifically at low a it assumes negative values. We point out that a different prescription of the
hypersurface, for instance, considering the freeze-out to happen at a fixed proper time 74. in all the fluid cells, leads
0 an integrand for the equilibrium contribution that is positive in the whole (py, a) plane. However, a systematic
study regarding alternative parametrizations of the freeze-out hypersurface is left for future work.
