Optical gain is a critical process in today’s semiconductor technology and it is most often achieved

via stimulated emission.

In this theoretical study, we find a resonant TE mode in biased low-

symmetry two-dimensional metallic systems which may lead to optical gain in the absence of stimu-
lated emission. We do so by first modeling the optical conductivity using Boltzmann non-equilibrium
transport theory and then simulating the scattering problem using a scattered-wave formalism. As-
suming that the system may possess a Berry curvature dipole (BCD) and a non-zero Magnetoelectric
tensor (MET), we find that the optical conductivity has a non-trivial dependence on the direction
of the applied bias, which allows for probing the TE mode. After analyzing the system with one
of each of the effects, we find that the resonant TE mode is only accessible when both effects are
present. Further studies are necessary to find materials with a suitably large BCD and MET, in

order to realize the predictions within this study.

I. INTRODUCTION

Optical gain is conventionally understood as the coher-
ent amplification of light resulting from the recombina-
tion of electrons in the conduction band with holes in the
valence band, a process known as stimulated emission,
raditionally requires population inversion [1-3]. In this
regime, an incoming photon stimulates the emission of
additional, phase-coherent photons, leading to an overall
increase in the intensity of the transmitted or reflected
ight. This mechanism forms the basis for laser opera-
ion and other active photonic technologies [1, 3]. While
a number of studies have proposed and experimentally
demonstrated gain mechanisms that do not rely on pop-
ulation inversions, the majority of these approaches still
‘undamentally involve stimulated emission as the key am-
lification process [4~7]. More recently, metallic electro-
optic (EO) effects have been predicted to enable intrigu-
ing optical responses in non-centrosymmetric systems, in-
cluding the possibility of non-reciprocal optical gain [8—
2|. The gain mechanism is fundamentally distinct from
stimulated emission-based processes, as they originate
urely from non-trivial intraband dynamics of Bloch elec-
rons in the presence of static fields, without relying on
interband transitions, representing a new paradigm of
ight amplification with potential applications in active
hotonic and optoelectronic devices, particularly in the
erahertz regime.

While metallic EO effects were originally ascribed to
he presence of a finite Berry curvature dipole (BCD) of
Bloch electrons on the Fermi surface [8, 11], recent de-
velopments have uncovered alternative intraband mecha-
nisms that could enable similar non-reciprocal responses
in quantum materials [10, 13, 14]. A notable example is

the linear magnetoelectric EO effect, which arises from
the magnetic moment texture of Bloch electrons on the
Fermi surface [10]. Owing to the intimate relation be-
tween the magnetic moment and Berry-curvature tex-
tures, a comprehensive description of the non-reciprocal
optical gain must incorporate effects stemming from both
features.

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive investigation
of the influence of metallic EO effects on non-reciprocal
optical gain in non-centrosymmetric quantum materials.
We adopt a unified theoretical framework that captures
the emergence of EO responses originating from the BCD
and the orbital magnetic moment of Bloch electrons at
the Fermi surface [10]. Within this formalism, we de-
rive the full set of quantum transport coefficients charac-
terizing bias-induced metallic EO effects and implement
a numerical electromagnetic wave scattering method to
compute the resulting optical response. This approach
enables a systematic analysis of optical gain optimiza-
tion, including mapping the gain phase space in terms
of key material parameters such as intrinsic anisotropy.
Our results reveal that the recently proposed magneto-
electric EO effect [10] is governed by a non-Hermitian
magnetoelectric tensor (MET) and gives rise to gain fea-
tures that are qualitatively distinct from those induced
by the BCD. We compare and contrast these two mech-
anisms, highlighting their individual and combined roles
in shaping the non-reciprocal response. A key finding
of this work is the central role played by the transverse-
electric (TE) mode in enhancing gain driven by metallic
EO effects. In particular, we show that the simultaneous
presence of MET- and BCD-induced EO responses en-
ables closer proximity to the TE-resonance with respect
to frequency, thereby unlocking a pathway to maximize
gain. Our results establish a general strategy for engi-

neering non-reciprocal optical amplification via metallic
EO effects, with implications for terahertz photonics.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section I, we in-
troduce the theoretical framework employed in this work,
including the classification of the mechanisms responsi-
ble for metallic EO effects and the electromagnetic wave
scattering methodology used to compute the optical re-
sponse. Section III presents the main results, starting
with a discussion of the role of the TE mode resonance
in subsection A. Subsection B focuses on the optical gain
induced solely by the BCD, while subsection C exam-
ines the contribution from the MET EO effect. In sub-
section D, we analyze the interplay between these two
mechanisms and their combined impact on optical gain.
Finally, Section IV provides a summary and concluding
remarks.

II. FORMALISM

We start by reviewing the formalism used in this study,
beginning with the generalized constitutive relations un-
der applied bias, followed by an overview of the scattering
mechanism framework.

A. Constitutive relations in the presence of bias

We focus on the simplest case where the two-
dimensional (2D) electron system is described by a
gapped Dirac Hamiltonian (see Appendix A for details).
In the low-frequency limit, hw «< A, with A being the op-
tical gap, the system’s electromagnetic response is dom-
inated by intraband transitions. In this regime, the con-
stitutive relation takes the form Jé(w) = of 4,(w) Ee,
which captures the conventional AC Drude response.
The corresponding transport coefficient is explicitly given
by:

the dilute impurity limit requires 7 < w, the semiclassi-
cal approach adopted here confines the frequency range
toy<w<A/n.

For our toy model system, the AC drude conductivity
tensor, in the basis E,, = Ex + Evy, is fully diagonal

Here, wy = s/h corresponds to the Fermi level 1, while
wa = A/2h defines a characteristic frequency associated
with the energy gap. In a later section, we will con-
sider the case of slight anisotropy, where the components
oe de and of" qe May differ. In these cases, we will
quantify the anisotropy by 7 = of) wae/F he ude:

The presence of a static electric field, Eo, alters the
system’s electromagnetic response by introducing a cor-
rection to the constitutive relation, leading to electro-
optical (EO) effects [10]:

JB (w) + JB (w) + Jeo), (3)

where JEG (w) can be written most generally as a function
of the electromagnetic fields, (E,,, B,,):

Fao (w) = of (w) BS + off (w) BE, (4)

in time-reversal symmetric systems lacking inversion
symmetry [10]. In contrast to previous studies that
considered only the contribution of of? Ww) [8, 9, 12],
this work also incorporates bias-induced magnetoelectric
terms, of? (w), and investigates their combined role in
enabling optical gain. This leads to a more comprehen-
sive description of the system’s EO response. In what
follows, we analyze the nature of the bias-induced cor-
rections in more detail.

Al. EO effects derived from the Berry curvature dipole

We begin by examining the nature of the metallic EO
effect described by the ose (w) coefficient. Prior stud-
ies have shown that this contribution originates from the
BCD of Bloch electrons [8-10, 12]. To linear order in
the optical fields, the applied bias introduces two pri-
mary corrections to the intraband optical conductivity,
captured by the following terms

?(w) = €aprX ES, (5)

gral in Eq. (6b) is simply the BCD up to a fi factor. For

Such metallic EO correction to the optical conduc-
tivity can be fully expressed in a compact form by in-
troducing the BCD tensor (up to the fi factor) D =
Dx (OFe/O€nk) Dn (In this work, we will use D to re-
fer exclusively to the Berry dipole tensor. Thus, it should
not be confused with the displacement electric field), with

where we have defined a fully antisymmetric electric field
ensor Fo, with components Fee = —€8)E3. In previ-
ous studies, these contributions were referred to as Her-
mitian (H) and non-Hermitian (NH) EO effects, respec-
ively [8-10, 12]. In this work, we assume the setup il-
lustrated in Fig. 1, where the system supports a single
BCD component oriented along an in-plane direction de-
ermined by an angle @ in relation to the y-axis. As-
suming that the orientation of the static electric field Eg
make a angle @ with the same axis, the explicit forms for
he Hermitian and non-Hermitian BCD-induced conduc-
ivity tensors are

Here, € = teE£yDo/h, where Ep = |Eo| and Do denotes
the magnitude of the BCD [see Appendix B for further
details]. Notably, the angular degrees of freedom 6 and
¢ offer control over the structure of the conductivity ten-
sor, a feature that has not been emphasized in previous
works [8, 12]. In particular, the Hermitian component of
the response can be completely suppressed by orienting
the bias perpendicular to the BCD, ice., oft = 0 when
6— = 7/2, for any Do and Ep. In subsequent sec-
tions, we will explore this freedom to enable favorable
conditions for maximizing optical gain.

Next, we summarize the EO effect contribution that
couples to the B,, optical field.

A2. EO effects derived from the magnetic moment texture

In this section, we examine the nature of the metallic
EO effect described by the a2? (w) coefficient. A prior
study revealed that the interplay between the Berry cur-
vature and magnetic moment texture of Bloch electrons
provides a mechanism to enable a Eo-induced response
given by [10]

We note that such contribution is non-Hermitian and,
therefore, it might also enable optical gain. Note that the
current response now explicitly depends on the transmit-
ted (incidence) angle p2 (p). Due to our assumption that
we have a 2D system, G has a single component oriented
along the z-axis, G** (associated with 07,,m%,,). Thus,
only Bz, couples to m2,. In subsequent section, og (w)
is re-written in the E.,-field basis, from which we obtain
a dependence on p2. For a detailed discussion, see Ap-
pendix C.

is the permittivity of the surrounding media and c is the
vacuum speed of light. In writing Eq. 14 we have also as-
sumed that the choice of xyz-coordinate orientations are
dependent on where the optical field is incident. Here, we
chose the coordinates such that the optical field is always
incident in the xz-plane, ie. ky = 0 (the y-component of
the wavevector k). In the previous section, however, the
coordinate orientations were determined by the crystal
axis, i.e. which way the BCD pointed. We will further
discuss this important distinction when analyzing our re-
sulting findings.

Together, Eqs. (2), (9), (10) and (14), account for the
relevant optical responses arising from the coupling be-
tween optical fields, static bias and the wave function
of Bloch electrons in inversion-broken time-reversal sym-
metric systems. Next, we describe the electromagnetic

wave scattering approach employed in this work.

B. The Electromagnetic wave scattering problem

In the following, we describe the formalism adopted in
this work for solving the scattering problem of s- and p-
polarized electromagnetic waves through a 2D material,
FIG. 1. Schematic and definition of parameters of the scat-
tering formalism alongside the directions of the non-zero com-
ponents of the G tensor and D dipole of a 2D metal at z = 0.
While the G tensor is fixed in the out-of-plane direction, the
direction of D (Ep) in the xy plane is determined by the angle
@ (¢), measured with respect to the y axis. The 2D metal is in
between dielectrics with relative permittivity «, (z < 0) and
€2 (z > 0). We assume that the plane of incidence is the xz
plane, containing the incidence wavevector kine.

with a given associated optical conductivity tensor o(w),
sandwiched in between dielectric media with refractive
indices n, and ng. This formalism closely follows that
presented in Ref. [15].

B1. Oblique incidence

Without loss of generality, we assume that the wave is
incident in the xz-plane and traveling in the +z direction.
For clarity, the phase factors e~*”’ are omitted. Thus,
the incident, reflected, and transmitted components of
the optical fields, E = E,, and B = B,, in this section,
can be written as [15]:

respectively, where a, r, t are the incident, reflected,
and transmitted waves amplitudes, respectively; the

subscripts s and p denote the s-polarized (TE) and
p-polarized (TM) components of the wave; p; and p2 are
the angles of incidence and transmission; and zp is the
vacuum impedance. Lastly, p; is related to pg by Snell’s
law, i.e. m1 Sin p; = ng sin p2. The setup is schematically
shown in Fig. 1.

The boundary conditions which relate the fields on the
top and bottom dielectrics are:

and

Combining in Eqs. (15)-(17) with Eqs. (18)-(20), and
solving for t,,tp,7s,"p in terms of as, a), we obtain:

transmittance coefficients written above, we briefly dis-
cuss the condition for optimizing the transmission in the
following.

B2. Optimization condition for the transmission

The Hermitian transmittance matrix T, which relates
the intensity of the incident wave to that of the trans-
mitted wave, given in the s- and p-polarized basis, is
T = (nz cos p2/n1 cos p1)t't, where [16]

t= li ial , (25)

Diagonalization of the matrix T yields two real eigen-
values, denoted Tryin and Tinax, With Tinax > Tmin. The
incident wave, composed of s- and p-polarized compo-
nents, that maximizes the transmittance corresponds to
the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue,
Tmax. A detailed derivation of this result is provided in
the Appendix D.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

We now present our main results. We begin by ana-
lyzing the conditions under which the TE mode can exist
and propagate in the presence of biased metallic systems.
Subsequently, we discuss our main numerical results, or-
ganized as follows: We begin by studying the optical gain
mediated by the BCD (section VI. B) and magnetic mo-
ment texture (section VI. C) of Bloch electrons at the
Fermi surface individually. Then, we analyze their si-
multaneous impact (section VI. D).

To this end, we consider a generic 2D metal at z = 0,
placed between two dielectric media with €, = €2 = 1.

Next, we apply a static, in-plane bias Ep to the metal and
consider an optical field E,, traveling in the +z-direction
in the xz-plane at an incidence angle p = p, = po, as
shown in Fig. 1. For the base electronic structure model,
we assume a band-gap energy A = 5 meV ® 1.21 THz
and a Fermi energy within the conduction band, pw =
5.1 meV. Here, we consider y = 10" rad/s ¥ 0.02 THz.
Thus, our analysis holds for frequencies within the inter-
val 0.02 < w/(2m) < 1.21 THz. Although the following
analysis seeks to elucidate the coupling between E,, and
earlier, we fo-

Ep via the metallic EO effects discusse
cus our attention on the regime where the transmittance
of E,, is above unity. For the remainder of the paper,

we use the terms ‘transmissive gain’, ‘optical gain’, and

‘gain’ interchangeably to mean the same phenomenon.

A. TE-Mode Resonance

We begin by analyzing the role of the TE mode res-
onance in the transmittance response and its potential
connection with the optical-gain.

Our findings indicate that a resonant TE mode can be
approached in a 2D metallic system possessing both a
finite BCD and a sizable magnetic moment on the Fermi
surface, through appropriate tuning of the external bias
field Eo. To show this, we analyze the poles of t,, explic-
itly. Assuming that the optical conductivity tensor can
be tuned to a diagonal and anisotropic form, a condi-
tion that we demonstrate to be achievable in subsequent
sections, the transmission coefficient for a TE-polarized

incident wave, under the assumption nj = ng = 1, given
by Eq. (21), reads
2cos p

2cos p+ za¥

(26)
Therefore, the TE-polarized optical field can excite a res-
onant mode when the conditions 2 cos p + zoRe(o%) = 0
and Im(o¥”) = 0 are simultaneously satisfied.

We emphasize that this mode is within the light cone,
since we assume scattering states. Hence, cos p is real and
p € (0, 7/2). In the ideal limit, 2 cos p+ zRe(o%) =0 >
Re(o¥”) = —(2/z9)cosp. But because p € [0,7/2) >

cosp > 0, we find that the resonant condition requires
Re(a¥”) < 0, which implies optical gain. Qualitatively,
the losses are compensated by the resonant energy ex-
change between the in-plane bias and the optical field.

Our study finds that optical gain is maximized as one
approaches the resonance. In particular, this resonance
corresponds to a TE mode, which is typically dismissed
in the analysis of light—matter interaction in 2D systems,
where bound TM modes are favored due to their en-
hanced field confinement [17-19]. Here, however, the TE
resonance plays a central role, becoming crucial to en-
able high optical gain, a feature not recognized in previ-
ous works. In a subsequent section, we will demonstrate
that while optical gain can arise in systems exhibiting ei-
ther BCD-induced or magnetoelectric EO effects, access
to the resonant mode requires the simultaneous presence
of both effects.

B. Optical Gain through BCD-induced electro-optic
effects

Here, we focus on the optical gain induced solely by the
BCD. As demonstrated in Refs. [8, 12], while the Hermi-
tian component of the EO effect, of, is non-dissipative,
the non-Hermitian part, oN™, can lead to negative power
dissipation for a given optical field chirality, i.e., it is this
H contribution that drives optical gain. To further in-
vestigate this effect, we exploit the freedom introduced
y ~ and the polarization of the optical field, to identify
he conditions that maximize transmission of normally
incident light (o = 0°) and, consequently, optical gain.
Since we are considering only normally-incident light, we
fix the direction of D along +y (@ = 0°).

Figure 2(b) displays the transmission as a function o:
he in-plane orientation of the static bias field Epo (ie.,
angle ¢). The results reveal that maximum transmis-
sion occurs when D | Epo, corresponding to a suppressec
Hermitian EO response (off = 0). Here, the transmis-
sion maxima at @ = 90°, 270° correspond to the situ-
ation when the anisotropy of the effective conductivity,
including the Drude contribution and the BCD-induced
EO effect, is maximized. That is, given the setup D L
Eo, the total effective conductivity assumes the form
oen(w) = diaglo%z (w) o¥¥(w)), with loz# (w) — 0% (w)
eing maximized. The explicit forms of the component
of the effective conductivity are o3i(w) = oprude(w) and

ow) = oprude(w) — oy” (w), where oj#(w) =
(e?/th)E/(y — iw). Henceforth, oo and o are used in-
erchangeably to denote the same quantity. Figure 2(d)
indicates that D 1 Eo enables optical gain even in the
low-scattering regime (y < w), which was inaccessible
in the setup of the Ref. [8] due to their assumption that
We find that TE-polarized light yields the highest op-
ical gain at @ = 270° and that the transmission peaks
at @ = 90° and ¢ = 270° are not equal. Figure 2(c)-
(d) shows the transmission at ¢ = 90° (c) and ¢ = 270°
(d) while sweeping the tilt angle W and the ellipticity
angle x of the incident field [see Appendix E for fur-
ther details concerning the relation between E-field com-
ponents and Poincare sphere parameters]. Comparing
Fig. 2(c) with Fig. 2(d), Timax(@ = 270°) > 1 whereas
Tmax(@ = 90°) < 1. The fact that Trax(¢ = 90°) <
Tmax( = 270°), as shown in Fig. 2(c), is related to the
sign of the power dissipated from the optical field E,, to
the material. From the non-Hermitian contribution, the
dissipated power pais = Re[EX - oN" - E,,]/2 is positive
for T(@ = 90°) and negative for T(¢ = 270°), meaning
optical loss and gain, respectively.

Physically, this phenomenon may be understood by an-
alyzing the non-equilibrium current density J = >>, fv
induced by the simultaneous presence of optical and
static fields. First, when Ep points along +x it induces
an anomalous velocity, proportional to Eg x © [20], along
the +y direction. Recall that we always assume y || E,,
for TE-polarized normally incident optical field. Second,
assuming linear response to the optical fields, the in-
duced non-equilibrium distribution function f oscillates
in-phase with E,,. Thus, the average power dissipated
from the optical field to the anomalous current density,
ie., the contribution derived from the anomalous veloc-

ity, is

where the vector representing the non-vanishing compo-
nents of the BCD is D = 7, fo). VO, can be chosen
such that E® - D is a positive quantity. When ¢ = 270°,
ie., the Eo direction is x, the anomalous velocity «x Eo xz
is antiparallel to E,,, resulting in a negative dissipated
power, i.e., optical gain. When @ = 90°, i.e., the Ep di-
rection is —x, the anomalous velocity is parallel to E,,, re-
sulting in positive dissipated power, i.e., loss. This high-
lights not only the importance of the orientation of Eo
relative to D, but also the linear response character of the
effect, that provides in-phase current-density oscillations
with the optical field, without which the time-average
vanishes. If E%,-D is a negative quantity and E*, points
along y, D points along —y, and hence our conclusions
hold the same with the prescription ¢ > ¢@+ 180°.

In addition to enabling the condition for maximal
transmission, our results show that at oblique incidence,
the angle ¢ ¢ [90°,270°] allows for the largest optical
gain, which induces off-diagonal components in the effec-
tive conductivity oeg(w). This leads to elliptically polar-
ized light that optimizes transmission, in agreement with
Ref. [8]. A slight increase in the optical gain is also ob-
served. However, the impact of the incidence angle will
not be addressed here. For the remainder of this section,
we restrict our analysis to normally incident light with
o = 270°.

In contrast with previous studies [8], our results re-
veal that the optical gain in the configuration discussed
above is bounded with respect to both the Berry curva-
ture dipole (BCD) and the magnitude of the static bias.
That is, the gain does not grow indefinitely with increas-
ing €, but instead reaches a maximum before decreasing.
This behavior arises from the dependence of the reflected
wave on €, which was previously assumed to be negligible.
Since € x EoDo, the enhancement of € can be attributed
to increases in either Do or Eo. As shown in Fig.3(a),
where we fix é = 15.3 THz, which corresponds to Do = 40
nm and Ey = 8x 104 V-m~!, and plot the reflection coef
ficient with respect to the dimensionless quantity E/E, the
reflected field grows in amplitude and becomes increas-
ingly out of phase with the incident wave as € increases,
causing the total field E,, = Eine + Erep to approach zero
in the large-€ limit. This destructive interference lim-
its the achievable gain. The non-monotonic dependence
of gain on € can also be understood from Eq. (26) and
the resonance conditions: increasing € scales the effective
conductivity, which is proportional to 1/(y — iw). Since
both Re(o¥#) and Im(o¥) scale together, increasing €
beyond the point where o%# most closely satisfies the
resonance leads to a detuning effect and a corresponding
reduction in gain.

The maximum gain can be enhanced by increasing the
scattering rate, y. While this trend is consistent with

revious studies [8], the mechanism behind the enhance-
ment differs in our setup. Earlier works attributed the
gain increase to impedance mismatch arising from the
growth of of as y decreases. In contrast, for the con-
figuration considered here, where D | Eo, the Hermi-
ian EO contribution of vanishes identically. Instead,
we find that Im(o%#) « w/(7? + w?), which tends to
zero as y — oo, enabling an increase in the attainable
maximum gain when D | Ep. This behavior is illus-
rated in Fig. 3(b), which shows the transmission of a
TE-polarized wave a function of the normalized € for dif-
ferent scattering rates 7, normalized by yo = 10'rad/s.
The transmission peak is highlighted for each case with
a symbol. The values of 7 are restricted to satisfy the di-
ute impurity limit, y < w, specifically y < 1-101! rad/s.

Furthermore, our results show that the bounded nature
of the gain remains robust in the presence of anisotropy.
To demonstrate this, we allow for unequal components
of the Drude conductivity, by varying of/g. and ana-
lyzing the optical gain phase space in Fig. 3(c), where
we fix a#¥ 4, to the conductivity value in Eq. (2). The
results reveal that anisotropy can either facilitate or hin-
der the onset of optimal optical gain at lower values of
€. Here, the bound between gain and no-gain regions in
the phase space is a linear function of anisotropy for all €.
The mechanism can be understood as being equivalent to
scaling the prefactor 1/(y — iw), effectively bringing 024
closer to satisfying the resonance condition. This coun-
terintuitive outcome offers an unusual means of control-
ling the maximum gain. In addition to strain engineering,
which can be used to achieve appropriate combinations of
anisotropy and € at fixed Eo, anisotropic van der Waals
heterostructures composed of intrinsically anisotropic 2D
materials have also been shown to support both sizable
BCD and a certain degree of anisotropy[21, 22]. Fig-
ure 3(c) also shows that the independent tunability of
the real and imaginary parts of og may aid in achieving
a higher gain. This conclusion is reinforced by Fig. 3(b),

where Re(o eq) is varied independently of Im(oeg), apart
from their magnitudes.

Next, we show that optical gain can also be attained
independently through the magnetoelectric EO effect, al-
though with distinct signatures.

C. Optical Gain through magnetoelectric
electro-optic effects

Here, we focus on the optical gain induced solely by
the magnetoelectric EO effect. As discussed previously,
we assume that the 2D system supports exclusively out-
of-plane components for 2.x and mx, such that there
is a single non-vanishing component for the EO MET G:
Go = G* = Diy (-OFo, /Oenk)O7,.m*,,. Furthermore,
to study the effect of Go alone, we assume that the BCD
vanishes. This is made possible by certain point group
symmetries [23], and will be taken here as an implicit
assumption. In the following, we take T = e,EoGo/c
to represent the magnitude of the bias-induced magneto-
electric coupling and focus on the general features of the
gain induced by og.

Due to G having only a G** component, orienting the
ay-axes is an arbitrary choice. We chose this orientation
such that the light is incident in the xz-plane, i.e. the
direction of incident light propagation fizes the ry-axis
orientation. From here, we may use Eq. 14 together with
the scattering formalism developed above. This treat-
ment is in stark contrast to the discussion of the optical
gain due to the BCD, since there we assumed that the
ay-axis orientations were dependent on the orientation of
D in the material. This distinction, although important
to understand, still allows for us analyzing the combined
effect of the MET and BCD (as done in the next section).

Figure 4(b) shows the transmission as a function of
the in-plane orientation angle ¢ of Eo, revealing that the
optimal configuration occurs at ¢ = 270°, akin to the
BCD scenario. However, it is important to note that

his configuration now refers to the relative alignment
etween Eo and the incidence plane xz. We emphasize
hat the shape of the oq tensor, given in Eq. (14), relies
on our convention for the place of incidence of E,, as
eing the xz plane. If the plane of incidence was chosen
o be the yz-plane, one would find oe 0k # 0 and
od, o¢/ = 0, which is consistent with G only coupling
with B* [see Appendix C for further details].
We also note that, similar to the BCD case, TE-
olarized light maximizes transmission at @ = 270°,
which is simply explained by the coupling between B*
and Ep via G. Thus, for the remainder of this section,
we limit our discussion to TE-polarized light traveling
oward the system at oblique incidence. Due to the sim-
ilarities between the og(w) and ogcp(w) tensor shapes
or the ¢ = 270° and «z incidence plane setup, we pro-
ceed by comparing the response signatures induced by
he BCD and the bias-induced magnetoelectric coupling.
Unlike the gain induced by the BCD discussed pre-
viously, the optical gain resulting from the og(w) ten-
sor increases monotonically with [ for 0 < rr < 2s
as shown in the effective conductivity anisotropy versus
[ phase space displayed in Fig. 4(c). Here, T denotes
a reference value of the magnetoelectric coupling, corre-
sponding to an applied in-plane electric field Eo = 8x 104
V/m and Go = 200 m?- V~'-s~!. The monotonic en-
hancement of optical gain with T, or Eo, arises from the
dissipative (real) surface-current responses in oq(w). Al-
hough both the BCD and bias-induced magnetoelectric
EO effect lead to a Drude-like perturbation of the dis-
ribution function df « 1/(y — iw) (deriving from the
alance between relaxation effects and the optical field
endency to drive the system out-of-equilibrium), the
coupling between the magnetic moment of Bloch elec-
rons and the B,, optical field also induces a Zeeman-
ike shift in the equilibrium distribution f°,, which grows
with w in a out-of-phase manner with respect to E,, [10].

This effect leads to |Im(o¢’)| < |Re(ogé’)| when 7 < w,
which allows for tuning 044, where oe(W) = ODrude(w)+
oa(w) , closer to satisfying TE-mode resonance condition
2cos p+ zoRe(o4#) = 0 without increasing the imaginary
component. This is in contrast with the BCD scenario,
where increasing € would bring o%} closer to satisfying
condition 2 cos p+zoRe(o%#) = 0 but also to deviate from
the second TE-mode resonance condition Im(o%#) = 0.
The contrast may be seen by comparing Fig. 3(c) with
Fig. 4(c). Optical gain in the latter case is best achieved
when of ae/Fhude = 9, since that is when Im(o¥) is
closest to 0. However, the sole presence of G does not
allow us to fully access the resonance either. Even if en-
gineering of o/h ude = 0 were possible, a finite + pre-
vents the second resonance condition Im(o%#) = 0 from
being achieved.

This motivates a closer examination of the combined
effects of og(w) and ogcp(w) on the optical gain, which
we explore in the following section.

D. Optical Gain in the General Case

We discuss here the features of optical gain when both
oq(w) and ogcp(w) are simultaneously non-vanishing.
The total effective conductivity becomes oe(w)
ODrude(W) + OBCD(w) + 7G(w). Since the optical field
only couples to the oq(w) at oblique-incidence, we only
consider p # 0 henceforth. We also only consider the con-
figuration with 9 = 0 and ¢ = 270°. These parameters
were verified to yield maximum transmission in the gen-

eral case, as discussed in previous sections. Moreover.
this configuration offers a clean scenario in which only
o4#(w) is modified, making it more suitable for isolating
and analyzing the contributions of the two effects.

We find that optical gain may be enhanced by the pres-
ence of sufficiently large Go, implying that we are able to

to the values used in Figs. 5(a)-(c). Drawing a parallel

this, however, would require a suitably larger Go, which
hasn’t been reported yet. Promising avenues to enable
such larger Go values may include Moiré quantum mat-
ter, which has been demonstrated to enable giant orbital

gain. This can be seen when comparing Fig. 5(a) with
Fig. 5(b), and Fig. 5(b) with Fig. 5(c), respectively. We
emphasize the role of the TE-polarization due to its cou-
pling to Ep via G (optical gain region in panels (a)-(c) of
Fig. 5 correspond incident light which is TE-polarized).

Tunable D and G simultaneously present allow for sat-
isfying both resonance conditions. Indeed,

where a’ captures the Drude contribution; a(Do) the

zero of Eq. (28) exists for a suitable choice of a’, a, and
8. This zero is illustrated in Fig. 5(d), where we show the

moments and Berry curvatures of Bloch electrons and
gigantic Berry curvature dipoles [24, 25].

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have shown that a resonant (scattering) TE mode
may be excited to yield optical gain in biased 2D metals
which possess a BCD and non-zero MET. To these ends,
we developed the system’s conductivity using the semi-
classical Boltzmann transport theory and found that the
TE mode is accessed when the anomalous electron veloc-
ity is perpendicular to the bias. The resonance occurs be-
tween the anomalous velocity imparted on the electrons
and the optical field. Within the limit linear response of
the current density to the optical field, we have shown
that this resonance, with suitable tuning of the system,
may be engineered to effectively be lossless. This finding
provides a promising avenue for realizing optical gain us-
ing intraband processes and the unique momentum tex-
tures of Bloch electrons on the Fermi surface. Further
studies may take one of two directions: one direction
which discovers materials which possess the large BCD
and MET necessary to fully access the resonant TE mode
and another direction which analyzes how bound modes
interact with the system. The latter direction is promis-
ing, due to the confined nature of plasmon interactions,
which may allow for large plasmonic gain without the
need for an unrealistically large BCD and MET.

APPENDIX A: EXPLICIT CALCULATION OF
THE CONDUCTIVITY COEFFICIENTS FOR A
SAMPLE TOY MODEL

Here, we derive practical analytical expressions for the
various conductivity coefficients in a 2D gapped Dirac
electron system. These results, primarily used as refer-
ences in the main text, are presented explicitly here for
completeness. The Hamiltonian is H, = hup(noxk, +
Oyky) + (A/2)oz, where 7 = £1 is the valley index, vp
is the fermi velocity, A quantifies the size of the energy
gap and oj, j = 2,y,2, are the Pauli matrices. Because
the BCD for such a toy model has already been calcu-
lated elsewhere [26], we are focusing on the derivation
of the Drude conductivity and the linear magnetoelectric
electro-optical effect coefficient. In the derivation that
follows, we assume the Fermi level satisfies p > A/2, en-
suring that the conduction band remains populated and
the system exhibits metallic behavior. Analogous expres-
sions can be obtained for pp < —A/2, in which case a finite
hole population governs the metallic response.

The extra subscript ’B’ in Eq. 55 is meant to indicate
that the tensor is in the B-field basis, i.e. Jg = ot'p Bu.
The remainder of this appendix is dedicated to trans-
forming Eq. 55 into the E-field basis. For a monochro-
matic incident wave, such as the one assumed in this
paper, the B-field may be related to the E-field in the
following way [27]:

where kn are the nth component of the k unit vector
in the 7th medium, and c is the vacuum speed of light.
B? is then equivalent to —kyE* +k,E¥. Note that in the
main text, we assume that the wave propagates in the xz-
plane, i.e. key =0=> het = sinp;. Since the quantity
V/ér sin p is conserved by Snell’s law, it suffices to only
consider \/é;,2 Sin p2. Hence, rewriting Eq. 55 in the E-
field basis by using Eq. 57 and combining the expression
for B-field coupling with the known E-field coupling com-
ponent allows us to re-write the conductivity in terms of
the E-field. Note that the time-reversal breaking of the
magnetic field is preserved under this operation, as the
direction of the wave’s propagation is captured by the k,
and ky terms, which get absorbed into the conductivity
expression. Thus,

APPENDIX D. TRANSMISSION-MAXIMIZING
POLARIZATION

In the E,, Ey basis, the transmittance matrix is T =
(ng cos p2/n; cos pi)t't. This matrix is then 2 x 2 Her-
mitian [8]. The normalized column-vector v, which max-
imizes the expression v'Tv is the eigenvector of T which
corresponds to the maximum eigenvalue [8].

We next show that this same treatment may be applied
to find the optimal polarization in the s- and p-polarized

12

basis. The magnitude of an arbitrary E-field is V ETE.

This is then ,/|E,|? +|E,|? +|E.|?. Plugging in values

from Eq. 18 in the main text, the magnitude of the E-

field is then
of the vector with TE-polarized and p-polarized compo-
nents is equivalent to the magnitude of the E-field vector,
we may maximize the transmittance with the procedure
described above.

APPENDIX E. GENERAL POLARIZATION
USING TILT AND ELLIPTICITY ANGLES

Light may be described by four parameters known as
the Stokes parameters [28]. Namely, they are [29]:

So =I (59)

S, = Ipcos 2W cos 2x (60)
So = Ipsin 2W cos 2x (61)
S3 = Ipsin2x, (62)

(63)

where J is the intensity, p is the degree of polarization,
W is the tilt angle measured with respect to the +z-axis,
and y is the ellipticity angle. In the main text, we con-
sider light which has intensity J = 1. We also limit our
discussion to fully polarized light, i.e. p = 1. With these
assumptions, we may relate the Stokes parameters to the
E,, Ey components of the oscillating optical field using
(28):

$1 = |B.|? — |By?

Eqs. 65-67, in terms of YW and x reads:
