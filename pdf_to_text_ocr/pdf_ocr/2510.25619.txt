Electrical detection methods for solid-state spins are attractive for quantum technologies, being
readily chip-scalable and not subject to the small photon budgets of single emitters. However, real-
ising electrical spin readout in wide-bandgap materials with similar fidelity and bandwidth to optical
approaches remains challenging. Here, we introduce a photoelectrical spin readout scheme that de-
tects spin information stored long-term as trapped electrical charges. Using nitrogen-vacancy (NV)
centres in diamond as a model system, spin-dependent photoionisation generates charge carriers that
are stored in long-lived trap states at a diamond-metal Schottky junction. On-demand illumination
of the junction under electrical bias releases stored charge, yielding a photocurrent transient pro-
portional to the amount of trapped charge and hence spin state. Spin readout after coherent control
of single NVs is demonstrated using charge readout in a protocol we call charge-capture detected
magnetic resonance (CCDMR), and we use charge-based imaging to identify charge carrier genera-
tion and trapping processes. Our results establish CCDMR as a new technique for solid-state spin

qubit readout, combining attaractive features of electrical detection with the stability of long-lived

charge traps in wide-bandgap materials.

I. INTRODUCTION

Optical preparation and readout methods confer myriad
advantages to spin qubits based on colour centres
in wide-bandgap (WBG) semiconductors, such as
ast, spectrally-selective initialisation and detection,
room-temperature operation, and simple experimental
setups based on commercial electro-optical components.
However, optical readout of spin qubits comes with the
drawback of typically low photon collection efficiency [1
which is further exacerbated by the high refractive
index of WBG materials such as diamond and silicon
carbide [2]. Further, optical detection schemes require
ulky, high-numerical aperture collection optics tha
ose challenges to integration and miniaturisation o
solid state spin qubits into practical sensing or infor-
mation processing devices. While integrated photonic
structures such as solid immersion lenses [3, 4] or waveg-
uides [5, 6] can significantly increase photon collection
efficiencies [7], alternative readout mechanisms such as
hotoelectric detection (PD) [8, 9] combine the simplic-
ity and flexibility of optical probing with the near-unity
collection efficiency of electrical charge carriers produced
y defects inside the host material. PD has been
demonstrated for single centres and defect ensembles in
oth diamond [8, 10] and silicon carbide [11, 12] and has
een employed to detect nuclear spins [13, 14] and, more
recently, proximal electron spins [15].

Photoelectrical readout schemes have experimental chal-
lenges, such as the presence of background photocur-

rent stemming from other defects [16] or from the
metal-semiconductor junctions required for electric in-
terfacing [17], limited measurement bandwidth owing
to slow current amplifiers [18, 19], trapping of charge
carriers by other defects [20-22], space-charge screen-
ing [23, 24], competing ionisation and recombination pro-
cesses [25, 26] and crosstalk between metal electrodes and
the electromagnetic fields used for spin qubit control [27].
Many of the issues encountered in photoelectric detec-
tion are directly related to unanswered questions per-
taining to the impacts of charge carrier generation, trans-
port, and trapping on the electronic properties of WBG
materials across different length scales [28-32], and are
also relevant to the stabilisation of colour centre charge
states [33-37].

In this work, we introduce a new scheme for PD of single
spins in WBG materials based on carrier generation from
spin defects and storage of the resulting charge in highly
stable interface trap states. Charge readout is then per-
formed by remote photoelectrical readout with laser il-
lumination of the semiconductor-metal interface, rather
than the spin defect itself or any trapped bulk charge dis-
tributions. We use single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre
defects in a high-purity CVD diamond as a prototypical
example and demonstrate imaging of single defects based
on liberation of trapped photocarriers. The photocurrent
generated by illumination of the metal-diamond interface
exhibits a characteristic amplitude that reveals the mag-
nitude of NV-generated charge, and spin-dependent car-
rier generation from the NV then allows us to obtain an
electron spin resonance spectrum from trapped charge
readout. We study this process in detail and support our
identification of electrode-generated hole photocurrent as
the underlying readout and charge-liberating mechanism

gle defect centres. Our results make important progress
in understanding the charge environment inside wide-
bandgap materials interfaced with electrical readout in-
frastructure and present an alternative method to con-
ventional photoelectric detection with several attractive
additional features. While we use the archetypal NV cen-
tre in diamond for our present work, our method can be
easily extended to other defects and host materials.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

Our experiment and the essential elements of our new PD
method, depicted in Fig. 1(a), consists of a custom scan-
ning confocal microscopy system simultaneously capable
of standard photoluminescence (PL) measurements and
PD. Planar 10 um? Cr/Au electrodes are fabricated onto
he oxygen-terminated surface of an electron-irradiated
(100)-cut electronic grade CVD diamond (Element 6)
y photolithography. A 0.8 NA apochromatic air objec-
ive focuses light to a diffraction limited (~400 nm) spo
and collects NV~ photoluminescence (650-750nm) with
a single-photon counting module (Excelitas). Within the
0 um lateral inter-electrode gap are individually resolv-
able NV centres with an average separation distance o
-2 um, distributed uniformly throughout the bulk of the

sample. An example photo

luminescence map is shown in

Fig. 1(a) for five NV centres situated approximately 4 um

below the diamond surface.

The continuous-wave illumi-

nation is tunable from 500-780 nm, though we typically
employ 532m green light for optical polarisation of NV
centres together with 633 nm for charge state control and
594nm for NV charge state readout [39]. Bias voltages
(-10 to 10V) are applied to the metal electrodes, and
one electrode is connected to a high gain current ampli-
fier (Stanford Research Systems SR570, nominal gain of
20 pA/V), the output of which is low-pass filtered (37 Hz
cutoff) to eliminate 50 Hz line noise pickup on the elec-
trodes.

III. RESULTS

A. Charge-based readout protocol

An archetypal experiment proceeds as follows: we
begin by illuminating a single NV centre under zero
applied bias voltage for some time with green light
(532nm) at powers sufficient to drive cycling between
the negative (NV~) and neutral (NV°) charge states of
the defect [39]. With each successive cycle of ionisation
(NV--NV°) and recombination (NV°+NV-), free
electrons and holes are injected into the conduction and
valence band of the diamond respectively. While these
free carriers can be quickly trapped by a host of intrinsic

impurities, such
(N) [20, 22, 40~
and a variety of surface states
be trapped in states localised
electrode interface [49, 50]. At
densities (<10 ppm), diamond,
rials hosting quantum defects at
below, exhibits
excitation, resulting in trappe
essentially indefinitely (51, 52].

he transient signal, as shown in Fig. 1(e). To demon-
strate definitively the role played by NV charge pumping,
we illuminate with the green laser (P = 3.5mW, t = 1s)
a point (x,y) and then readout the accumulated charge
by applying a bias voltage and illuminating at the metal-
diamond junction. Scanning across the same spatial re-
gion as in Fig. 1(a) results in a Qint vs laser position
map in Fig. 1(e), with single NV centres identified as the
omainat sources of additional charge. Notably, photo-
electrical imaging demonstrates a 30% improvement in
spatial resolution and 10% contrast improvement com-
pared to the equivalent fluorescence image.

C. Charge-capture detected magnetic resonance

The photoionisation probability of negatively-charged
NV centres is spin-dependent due to the increased
probability of the magnetic states mg = +1 to cross
to a coupled metastable singlet state when compared
to the mg = 0 state, which reduces the ionisation
rate from the excited °E state [9, 56, 57]. Analogous
to photoelectrically-detected magnetic resonance [8],
spin-to charge conversion [58] and ancilla-assisted charge
measurements [38], it follows that NV spin information
should be encoded into the EGPC transient signal.
We adapted a standard optically-detected magnetic
resonance pulse sequence for use with EGPC readout,
a protocol we term charge-capture detected magnetic
resonance, or CCDMR. Briefly, a short (2.5 us) 532 nm
pulse at 300 pW is used to initialise a single NV~ defect
into the mg = 0 ground state. Low powers are chosen
to minimise unwanted carrier generation. Then, a
100 ns microwave 7-pulse of varying frequency is applied
and a second, shorter (500ns) 532nm pulse of high
power (3.5mW) is then applied to the NV to initiate
photoionisation. The sequence is repeated hundreds
of thousands of times (over approximately 1.5s) to
generate a spin-dependent trapped charge population
in the sample. Finally, we read the trapped charge by
illuminating the positively-biased electrode edge with
3.5mW of green at a bias voltage of 2.2 V as discussed
previously to obtain a measure of the accumulated
charge for each microwave frequency. We observe a dip
in the CCDMR spectrum at 2.87 GHz which exhibits a
contrast of 5.42+ 0.46% in Fig. 2(b,left). The negative
dip indicates a reduction in NV-generated photocarriers
at resonance, consistent with a reduced rate of NV~/°
charge cycling due to shelving by the longer-lived spin
singlet manifold. Applying a bias magnetic field of 4G
along the NV axis splits the CCDMR resonance, shown
in Fig. 2(b, right), by 20 MHz and results in a contrast of
7.28 £0.56 % and 7.19+0.55 %, facilitating independent

re, the transient decay remains the same over extremely
long timescales of at least a day (Fig.1(d)). We calculate
he integrated additional charge Qint released during the
readout step by subtracting the steady-state EGPC from

addressing of each s

out method with fidelity comparable to standard op-
ical and PD techniques. The obtained Rabi contras
of 18.4+2.4% even exceeds that typically obtained by
PDMR measurements [9], which may suggest more ef-
ficient suppression of background charge sources in this
delayed-readout configuration. However, the significant
noise in CCDMR measurements needs to be better un-
derstood, and we also note that our current CCDMR
measurement sequences are significantly slower than op-
ical equivalents owing to the requirement for ~ 10s o:
illumination to fully liberate all NV-generated trappe
charges. As these issues are the primary bottleneck in
limiting applicability of our technique in NV-based sens-
ing and information processing, we now turn our atten-
ion to more detailed examination of the readout mech-
anism at play.

D. Readout mechanism

Optical illumination of the electrode-diamond junction
serves to liberate stored charge originating from single
NV centres, and we have shown that spin information
can be extracted from the accumulated charge. We
now focus on the readout mechanism in more detail.
First, we show that illumination of the metal-diamond
interface is the origin of both the EGPC and the
liberation of trapped NV centre charge by probing the
spatial dependence of the readout process. To this end,
we pump a source NV centre (NVg in Fig. 1(a)) with
3.5mW of green light for 1s to generate charges, then
vary the position where the readout laser pulse is applied
across the positively-biased contact. We also change the
focus position into the diamond to examine the depth
dependence of the readout process.

Electrode photocurrent was found to be strongest at the
contact edge facing the ground electrode in Fig. 3(a),
and exhibited a strong dependence in depth, showing
hat the highest integrated charge was measured at
he diamond-electrode boundary ~4.5tm above the
source NV. Next, we fixed the position of the readout
aser and depth to yield maximum signal and varied the
ower of the 532 nm illumination at the contact to probe
he dependence of the integrated charge and temporal
dynamics of the EGPC transient. For a single NV
ump power and duration (3.5 mW, and 1s respectively)
increasing power at the electrode exhibited increasing
integrated charge (as seen in Fig. 3(b) left axis) with
a tendency towards saturation level at high power.
Further, the EGPC transient was fit with a double
exponential and the limiting (slow) decay constant was
found to monotonically decrease as the laser power
increased (as seen in Fig. 3(c) right axis). This follows
intuitively, as higher power illumination should liberate
rapped charge faster. Illuminating the contact with
higher powers appears to lead to larger integrated charge
efore eventually saturating, indicating that the more
ower used, the more charge is released. Ideally the
aser power would be set to the power saturation point
o completely liberate the NV generated trapped charge.
However, powers in the 10s of mW range are difficul
© implement and could also result in damage to the
electrodes with tight focusing.

Finally, the wavelength of illumination light usec
for readout to probe the energetics of the associated
rapping defects. We found that for the same source
NV pumping parameters (1s and 3.5mW at 532nm)
and independent of applied bias voltage, the measured
integrated charge increased significantly for wavelengths
elow 570nm (photon energies of 2.2eV) as shown
in Fig. 3(d), with a maximum at 540nm (2.3eV).
Curiously, 2.2eV is also the observed photoionisation
hreshold of substitutional nitrogen [25], though the
spatial dependence of the readout illumination strongly
suggests that charge storage occurs at interface states
introduced during the Au/Cr metallisation of the
diamond surface.

When the bias potential is inverted, the spatial de-
pendence observed above is replicated on the left-hand
electrode, and no EGPC or charge transient is observed
when the readout laser targets the right-hand (nega-
tively biased) electrode, consistent with our model of
EGPC discussed earlier. Along the contact facing the
ground pad, there is no significant spatial dependence

on

Qint, Suggesting either that the interface states are
niformly distributed or that charge transfer is limited
y a global potential barrier rather than local variations.
n other experiments, we found that illumination of the
electrode edge without an applied bias voltage following
the generation of charges from a source NV attenuates
the integrated charge detected in subsequent readout,
indicating that light alone is sufficient to deplete trapped
charges.

We then studied the temporal accumulation of trapped
charges as a function of the source NV distance to the
electrode. We located three NV centres, NV g (the source
NV from previous experiments), located almost exactly
in the centre of the electrode gap, NVji, located 16 um
away along the y-axis and a third, NV2, located 50 um
away along y, as shown in Fig. 3(d). All three NV centres
are at approximately the same depth of 4m. We then
pumped a given NV centre with 3.5mW of green light
for a variable duration before returning to the same opti-
mal electrode readout position and reading the trapped
charge. Repeating for all three defects, we measured the
accumulated charge Qing as a function of pumping time
in Fig. 3(d). We observed that the two NVs located fur-
cher away take longer to register a measurable charge
on the electrodes during readout, though even at 50 um
away can still be detected with sufficient pumping time.
Interestingly, after such long pump times, the liberated
charge at the electrodes is essentially the same as for the
wo closer NVs, suggesting that trapped charge in the
bulk of the diamond is not contributing significantly to
he measured photocurrent transient. The same fixed
number of electrode traps addressed by the laser appear
o fill more slowly for more distant charge sources, but re-
lease the same amount of charge upon illumination. The
significantly larger region of bulk sample exposed to car-
rier flux from the distant source NV either does not trap
significant numbers of carriers, or is not depleted upon
initation of the EGPC readout. We return to this point
again later in the manuscript.

E. Photocurrent imaging

Having established that the charge storage and readout
mechanism relies on metal-diamond interface states with
photoactivation energies around 2.2eV, we now explore
in more detail the identity of the trapped charge carriers.
We employ the array of NV~ defects as single-pixel
hole-current detectors [22] that change charge states
(and hence emission wavelength) upon capture of a
hole. With appropriate optical filtering (long-pass cutoff
wavelengths of 650nm), NV~ appears bright while
NV° appears dark under weak orange (3 WW, 594nm)
illumination. Single-shot charge state identification of
single NVs amounts to determining the photons emitted
in a 50 ms pulse of orange light. Fluorescence histograms
were measured for several dozen NV centres in proximity

to the electrode assembly. We calibrated each histogram
using short, strong red (633nm) illumination to create
NV° with almost unity probability [59] and green light
which yields NV~ with ~ 70% probability [60], and
characteristic NV~ and NV° count thresholds were
described by bi-modal Poissonian distributions.

The target NV centres were then prepared in the NV~

requirement for lock-in detection schemes to facilitate
electrical readout of pulsed measurements.

There is significant scope to build upon our findings. A
necessary avenue of future work is to identify in detail
he traps responsible for carrier trapping, which our
work suggests are located at the interface between the

metal electrode and d

iamond, have an activation energy

(bright) state using
(3.5mW) was moved

green light and then the laser
‘o the electrode boundary to stim-

ulate an EGPC under an applied 1V bias. After cur-
rent generation for some time T, the charge state of each
NV was read out to determine if any defects underwent
charge transfer to NV° due to photogenerated hole cap-
ure. We found that a hole current emanated from the
entire electrode junction, which resulted in a sharp de-
endence of the hole capture rate measured as a function
of shortest distance from the electrode boundary, shown
in Fig. 4(a). As the illumination time at the contact in-
creases, the array of NV~ centres become progressively
darker due to higher probability of hole capture, as il-
ustrated in Fig. 4(b). Notably, the spatial dependence
of hole capture rate is lost when considering the laser
spot to be a point source of holes. As shown in the in-
set of Fig. 4(a), defects closer to the electrode, and not
he point of illumination on the electrode, are more likely
0 capture holes. The behavior of the NV~ to NV° de-
cay indicates that the current generated by the EGPC
rotocol is injected into the diamond non-locally to the
aser illumination spot along the entire diamond-metal
interface. Next, we pumped the source NV with green
ight to generate charge carriers that become trapped at
he electrode boundary and repeated the above experi-
ment. Here, the additional trapped charge from the NVs
— which can thus be identified conclusively as holes —
result in a faster decay in NV~ probability (shown in
Fig 3(c) by a representative number of NV centres high-
ighted in red circles in Fig 3(b)), consistent with ad-
ditional photogenerated holes being liberated from the
electrode charge traps.

IV. DISCUSSION

We have introduced a novel photoelectric detection
scheme where charge carriers generated by single NV
centres can be stored almost indefinitely in long-lived
charge traps primarily localized at metal-diamond
Schottky junctions. As the NV photoionization process

is spin-dependent, t
single NV is also spin

ne charge flux emanating from a
dependent. We confirmed that our

technique facilitates measurement of single NV spins un-

der coherent control

protocols, highlighting its potential

as an alternative photoelectrical interface for quantum
sensing and information processing. Our method has
several attractive features, including long-term storage
of spin information in charge traps, no crosstalk between
microwave control fields and electrical readout, and no

near 2.2eV, and are predominantly acceptor-like given
heir propensity to trap and emit holes. The Cr/Au
electrodes used in this work were deposited onto an
oxygen-terminated surface with no subsequent annealing.
Future work could experiment with alternative contact
materials (e.g., Ti, Al, graphite [61]), surface termina-
ions (O, H), and processing steps such as annealing to
create more Ohmic-like electrode contacts [62]. Further,
varying the electrode geometry or fabricating circular
electrodes proximal to/surrounding single NV centres
could also serve to improve trapping yield. Conversely,
he traps identified in this work could be responsible for
reduced collection efficiency or unwanted background
current in conventional photoelectric detection [16, 17],
so combining materials engineering with careful analysis
of trapping behaviour using the techniques reported here
could also bring benefits.

Our method does not confer any immediate advantages
in spin contrast over existing PD or spin-to-charge
conversion schemes, as ultimately the photophysics of
the NV and specifically the inter-system branching ratio
for mg t1 states limits contrast to ~ 30-40% [63].
However, it is worth noting that combining spin-to-
charge protocols [58, 64, 65] that optimise spin-selective
ionisation with electrical readout has not been explore
significantly. The fast pulsed nature of these sequences
(using red ionisation pulses 10 mW-+ of only a few 10s
of ns) may be difficult to implement in conventional
PD, whereas such protocols are eminently feasible anc
compatible with our technique [38].

Beyond the proof-of-principle stage, we can consider
intriguing extensions that realize the full potential
of hybrid photoelectrical readout. One particularly
interesting possibility is to increase PD bandwidth by
releasing the trapped charge faster using ultrafast laser
pulses. Fast, sensitive charge-coupled amplifiers with
sensitivities into the f{C range and bandwidths of GHz or
more [66] could then be employed in place of slow, high
gain transimpedance amplifiers ubiquitous in PD. Using
a second laser focused only on the optimum electrode
readout point (24, 65] may also enable continuous read-
out of charge accumulation during NV measurements,
precluding the need to accumulate sufficient charge
over long integration times to yield measurable charge
transients. As we found that hole currents originate from
the entire metal-diamond interface region rather than
the illuminated region alone, it may also be possible to
realize fully integrated PD by generating these carriers

Figure 4. Spatial mapping of hole current density. a) Decay rate from NV~ to NV° measured as a function of the
shortest distance from the electrode edge to each NV centre. Inset: Decay rates measured as a function of radial distance from
the contact illumination spot. b) Maps of average photon counts obtained from each measured NV centre (circled areas) as a
function of contact illumination time under a 1 V bias. PL image was acquired with green light, and the electrode boundaries
are shown in dashed white lines. Transition from green (NV~) to blue (NV°) indicates increased probability of hole capture.
The laser illumination spot is indicated by the green cone. c) Decay rate from NV~ to NV° for the case where the NV is first
pumped for 1 s to generate photocarriers prior to EGPC initiation (left) and the case where no photocarriers are introduced
before EGPC initiation (right).

readout method with potentially superior sensitivity and
bandwidth to conventional PD.

In conclusion, we have shown that interface traps at a
diamond-metal Schottky junction provide a means to
probe single-spin dynamics with performance compara-
ble to conventional PD schemes. This work opens nu-
merous avenues of further inquiry targeted towards both
the fundamental mechanism of EGPC readout as well
as the best pathways towards engineering practical inte-
grated devices for rapid, high-fidelity spin measurements.
We anticipate that optimisation of the electrode geom-
etry and metallisation chemistry will yield substantial
improvements in performance, while deployment of ded-
icated spin-to-charge conversion protocols could improve
spin-dependent carrier generation.
