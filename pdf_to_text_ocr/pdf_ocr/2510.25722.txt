Abstract

Measurements of the spectral emission properties of an iron-doped a B-Ga203(010) photocathode
at 300K reveal the presence of ultracold electron emission with a 6meV mean transverse energy
(MTE) in the 3.5-4.4eV photon energy range (282-354nm). This extreme sub-thermal
photoemission signal is consistent with direct emission of electrons photoexcited from the Fe
dopant states into the low effective mass and positive electron affinity primary conduction band,
and it is superimposed on a stronger signal with a larger MTE associated with an
(optical)phonon-mediated momentum resonant Franck-Condon (FC) emission process from a
thermally populated and negative electron affinity upper conduction band. For photon energies
above 4.5eV, a transition from a long to a short transport regime is forced by an absorption depth
reduction to below 100nm and both MTE signals exhibit spectral trends consistent with phonon-
mediated FC emission if the polaron formation self-energy is included in the initial photoexcited
electron thermalization.
Introduction

Understanding the fundamental physical processes involved in photoemission is key to the
development (or discovery) of photocathode materials capable of delivering high brightness
electron beams.'* Of particular interest are laser-driven pulsed photoelectron sources with a low
transverse beam divergence (i.e., initial mean transverse energy (MTE) of the photoemitted
electrons) as this will improve the performance of x-ray free electron lasers,*° ultrafast electron
diffraction systems,'*!> and dynamic transmission electron microscopes!*'!* — scientific
instruments at the forefront of high space-time resolution dynamic structural studies of solid-
state materials!??! and molecules.??*> For example, even a modest reduction of a pulsed electron
beam’s MTE at the entrance of an XFEL undulator by a factor of ~5 (emittance reduction of 2-3)
is expected to increase its optical output beam brilliance or, alternatively, its emitted x-ray photon
energy by an order of magnitude.”®”’ Similarly, for the case of electron diffraction, a lower MTE
will improve the fidelity (i.e., quality) of the diffraction pattern due to the associated increase in
the transverse coherence length of the electron beam.”*”?

The brightness of an electron pulse containing N electrons at emission from a photocathode is
conventionally defined’? as being proportional to I/(Enx €ny) with its peak current J = Ngq/t: Here
Ng is the total pulse charge, énx and én are the normalized transverse beam emittances
(propagation in the z direction), and t is the rms electron pulse duration (essentially the time
resulting from the convolution of the incident laser pulse shape generating the electron pulse and
the temporal function associated with the ‘response time’ of the photocathode*'). For an initial
emitting rms transverse beam size ox on the photocathode surface (e.g., the incident laser spot
size) and circular beam symmetry, the one-dimensional (x) normalized transverse beam
emittance can be expressed as €ny, = Ox) (p2)/ (moc),*? where Ap, = J (p2) is the rms
transverse momentum of the photoemitted electrons, mo is the free electron mass, and c is the
speed of light in vacuum. As the mean transverse energy of electrons emitted from the

photocathode is defined by MTE = — (pz + p3) = (p2)/mpy for a circularly symmetric beam,
0

the electron pulse’s four-dimensional transverse phase space volume may be written as €nyEny =
0, 0y.MTE/ (moc). Thus, since N is given by photocathode’s quantum efficiency (QE)
multiplied by the number of absorbed photons in the incident laser pulse, the brightness of the
electron pulse (beam) is proportional to the ratio aa . Although much prior effort has been put
into the maximizing (and optimizing) the QE of photocathodes, with some semiconductor

photocathodes in the 10% range,*?** reports of an MTE significantly below the ‘thermal limit’*>

(e.g., 25meV at 300K °°” and 8meV at 90K 3°) have been scarce*”*! despite theoretical
predictions.°?*?"

In this paper, we present experimental results that break this paradigm; namely, the observation
of 6meV MTE electron photoemission from a planar, iron-doped, single-crystal Gallium oxide
photocathode at 300K. The observed low MTE signal is consistent with direct emission into the

2
vacuum states from the lower conduction band (LCB) of Ga2O3 for which it is theoretically
expected” that MTE ~ (=*) kgTe due to transverse momentum conservation’”: Here m+. is the
0

transverse effective mass of the emitting band states, ks is Boltzmann’s constant, and 7e is the
temperature of the emitting electron distribution determined by the cooling and transport
dynamics in the photocathode. This ‘inner’ signal is superimposed on a stronger ‘outer’ signal
with a larger MTE that is shown to be consistent with (optical)phonon-mediated Franck-Condon
(FC) emission of thermalized electrons populating an upper conduction band (UCB) in Ga203
with a negative electron affinity y.***? Methods of enhancing the quantum efficiency of the
desired (ultra)low MTE inner signal with respect to the background FC emission are discussed.

Further, the presented spectral MTE measurements of the Fe:Ga203(010) photocathode clearly
display emission physics associated with two transport regimes.** Below an incident photon
energy ho of 4.5eV, where the sub-thermal 6meV MTE inner signal is observed, the long
transport regime is prevalent as photoexcitation into the LCB is from the optically active, near
mid-gap Fe dopant states.°° Above ha = 4.5eV, band-to-band absorption significantly reduces
the absorption depth forcing the photocathode into the short transport regime in which both the
inner and outer MTE signal are consistent with phonon-assisted FC emission. Moreover, in this
latter regime, evidence is also presented that points to a rapid polaron establishment resulting in
an increase in the electron temperature associated with the release of the polaron formation self-
energy.>!°? Consequently, in addition to providing insights into the energetic dynamics of
polaron formation, the Fe-doped Gallium oxide photocathode provides an opportunity, in a single
material, to study distinct photoemission mechanisms in two electron transport regimes
characterized by different photoexcited carrier densities and dissimilar thermalized electron
temperatures.

Experimental and Theoretical Methods

The studied B-polymorph,* single-crystal, Gallium oxide sample was provided by Kyma
Technologies Inc.*4 and is oriented for (010)-face emission. The ~7x7mm sample is 450,1m thick
and the ‘epi ready’ emission face has a surface roughness Ra < 0.5nm which ensures that
photocathode surface roughness*>>” does not affect the measurements to any significant extent.*®
It is also Fe doped to a level of ~10!8cm* to ensure semi-insulating behavior, generating two
optically-active iron states at 3.05(+0.05)eV and 3.85(+0.05)eV below the primary LCB
minimum.°° The photocathode is therefore transparent in the visible with a weak absorption
onset at ~400nm due to absorption from the upper Fe dopant state, which pins the Fermi level, to
the LCB.

calculated vacuum level at 6.0(+0.2eV) is depicted by the blue region and the important energies of the LCB
and UCB minima are labeled.
Our in-house density functional theory (DFT) calculation of the electronic band structure of B-
Ga20s is shown in Figure 1 together with the energetic positions of (i) the upper (pinning the
Fermi level) and lower Fe dopant states and (ii) the occupied (below the Fermi level) and
unoccupied known defect states (likely oxygen vacancies) of the oxide photocathode.** The Ab
initio band structure evaluations are performed using the Amsterdam Modeling Suite’s BAND
module? with rSCAN-family functionals” from the LibXC library.*' They indicate that the
effective electron mass associated with the ’-point dispersion of the LCB is 0.22mo, in
agreement with literature values.** They also place the minimum of the next highest UCB at
about 2.36eV above the LCB minimum which itself is located at the 4.8eV I’-point band gap
above the anisotropic valence band.** Together with thin slab calculations,” that place the
vacuum level 6.0(+0.2eV) above the valance band (as shown in Figure1), this provides
theoretical values of yicp = 1.2(+0.2)eV and yucs = —1.1(+0.2)eV for the electron affinities of
the LCB and UCB respectively.

Our prior work™ on the optical properties of the Fe:Ga203(010) photocathode also revealed that
the product of the absorption coefficient and the sample thickness, a/, is less than unity for
incident photon energies ha below 4.5eV and increases sharply for ha > 4.5eV. This leads to
two electron transport regimes for the oxide photocathode.** For photon energies between the
3.05eV ‘threshold’ for photoexcitation into the LCB from the upper Fe dopant state*? and 4.5eV,
electrons are photoexcited into the LCB from the two Fe states over the entire 450m thickness
of the photocathode, leading to a ‘long’ transport regime for the emitted electrons. Conversely,
for ha > 4.5eV, the absorption depth becomes increasingly much shorter than the sample
thickness, leading to a ‘short’ transport regime for the emitted electrons. The prior absorption
measurement” therefore suggests that the ‘effective’ band gap of B-Ga2Os could be as low as
4.5eV due to both indirect absorption associated with the anisotropic valence band® and a
probable significant Urbach tail, irrespective of the observed ~0.25eV red-shift of the direct I-
point band gap as the temperature is increased from near zero (the effective temperature of DFT
band structure calculations) to the 300K experimental temperature.°*4 Based on the photon
energy dependence of the direct band-to-band absorption for GaN,°° which has a similar ~0.2mo
effective mass for its LCB,°° the absorption depth in this latter regime is expected to be quickly
reduced to less ~100nm just above hw ~ 4.5eV.

These two transport regimes and the energetic positions (i.e., electron affinities) of the LCB and
UCB with respect to the vacuum level are key to understanding the observed spectral
dependence of the MTE for the Fe:Ga203(010) photocathode. Specifically, with a knowledge of
the temperature Te of the electron distribution in the bulk photocathode, whereas direct one-step

band emission predicts that MTE ~ (=*) kpTe,** for momentum-resonant FC emission in the

case for B-Ga2O3,” multi-phonon emission””” is likely and a series solution evaluation for the

MTE is generally required as outlined in Ref. 71.

The spectral dependence of the MTE for the Fe:Ga203(010) photocathode is measured at 300K
using a sub-picosecond tunable UV laser system coupled to a 10-20kV DC gun-based
photocathode characterization system as described in Refs. 72 and 73. Briefly, optical
parametric amplification of a nonlinear fiber generated continuum, driven by a 20W, 16.7MHz
femtosecond Yb:fiber laser system, is upconverted by sum frequency generation to produce
~0.5ps UV pulses. The generated p-polarized, 230-400nm radiation with an average power of
10-100uW is incident at 60° and focused to an area of 2x10~“cm? (~70x140j4m diameter spot
size) on the photocathode surface. The resultant incident peak pulse intensity of ~100kW/cm?
ensures that the observed photoemission is almost entirely due to one-photon absorption since

7473 implies that an intensity of

the ~l1cm/GW two-photon absorption coefficient of B-Ga203
greater than 1MW/cm? is required for nonlinear absorption effects to approach the 1% level over
the 450m sample thickness. The photoemitted electrons accelerated in the DC gun enter a
42cm drift region before detection using a microchannel plate/phosphor screen detector the
output of which is imaged onto a CMOS digital camera. The photocathode characterization
system is calibrated for MTE measurements using accurate electron trajectory simulations” and

has a DC gun voltage dependent resolution of 0.5-lmeV.
Long Transport Regime

The measured spatial photoemitted electron beam profiles are comprised of two emission signals
over the entire investigated 3.4 to 5.3eV photon energy range; a low MTE ‘inner’ signal with
~1% (or less) of the emitted electrons riding on a larger MTE ‘outer’ signal. Both signals are
clearly evident in the electron beam profile displayed in Figure 2 obtained at ha = 4.33eV which
is in the long transport regime (a/ < 1) for the Fe:Ga2O3 photocathode.** The shown double
Gaussian fit through the diameter of the measured spatial beam profile yields the MTEs of both
emission signals; 6(+1)meV for the inner signal and 280(+25)meV for the outer signal. The
emission MTE of the inner signal is therefore distinctly ‘sub-thermal’ for the 300K
photocathode; that is, significantly less than 25meV. It is, however, consistent with direct (band
to vacuum) emission from the Boltzmann tail of the thermalized electron distribution in the LCB
that is above the vacuum level (see Figure 1). Two factors lead to this conclusion. First, for the

6
quoted ~300cm?/(V.s) limiting electron mobility in Ga2Os °° and our applied 1.6kV/cm internal
field (16kV/cm DC gun acceleration field and a dielectric constant’® of around 10), the electron
drift velocity to the emission face va < 5,000m/s; that is, ~5% of the theoretical saturation drift

velocity under optical deformation potential scattering™ vg, ~ ./3h.Q/(4m* coth(hQ/2T,)) =
9.5x10*m/s for an electron in the LCB (m* ~ 0.22mo *) at the Ti = 300K lattice temperature
predominantly scattering with the strongest lowest energy hQ ~ 25meV optical phonon
mode.*””” Based on electron transport analysis under these conditions® T,/T, = 1+ vqg/Vas;
so that the energy of the drifting electron distribution AnTe ~ 27meV. Second, our DFT
evaluations of the band structure of Ga2O3 reveal that the LCB in the vicinity of the vacuum
level (1.2eV above its minimum (Figure 1)) has a dispersion transverse to the (010) emission
direction associated with an effective mass m7 = 0.24(+0.02)mo. For direct (band to vacuum)
emission, this low transverse effective mass is predicted to restrict the transverse electron
momentum states that can emit into the vacuum,*’ giving an expected constant MTE ~

(=*) kgTe of 6-7meV “° — clearly consistent with the experimental measurement.

subtracted digital signal at ho = 4.33eV showing the lower MTE inner signal (red) and higher MTE outer
signal (blue). Right panel: Fitted Gaussian spatial beam profiles to a horizontal section through the peak of
the digital data (black). The sum of the weaker inner (red) and stronger outer (blue) Gaussians generate the
fit (purple dots). The ~7:1 ratio of the outer to inner beam widths immediately give a ~50:1 MTE ratio as the

horizontal (pixel) axis is directly related to the transverse momentum: Inner signal MTE = 6(+1)meV and
outer signal MTE = 280(+25)meV. The Gaussian fits therefore imply a ~500:1 ratio in the outer to inner
signal strengths; that is, for this incident photon energy, the smaller inner signal is ~0.2% of the total signal.

Armed with the knowledge that ksTe ~ 27meV in the long transport regime, the origin of the
larger MTE outer signal in Figure 2 can also now be determined. First, we note that this signal

7
cannot be due to (optical)phonon-mediated Franck-Condon electron emission from electrons
above the vacuum level in the LCB. This is because for yicp  +1.2eV and Ap7e = 27meV,
equation (1) for PEA FC emission predicts an MTE of about 27meV; that is, one order of
magnitude less than that measured. Consequently, for a highly polar material like Ga2Os, the
outer signal is very likely due to FC emission from the next highest band (Figure 1) — the UCB
with a negative electron affinity (NEA) yucs ~ —1.leV. Indeed, the Frohlich coupling constant
of g= 1.2 for the LCB of Ga203 © suggests that this is the case since the effective mass
dependence of optical deformation potential scattering,’ g = Vm* go indicates a large value of
about 2.5 for the ‘intrinsic’ (m* = mo) Frohlich coupling constant go. In fact, for kpTe » 27meV
and yucs * —1.leV, our expanded multi-phonon (g > 1) NEA FC emission series summation
analysis described in Ref. 71 can be used to fit the measured 280(+25)meV outer signal MTE
using g ~ 3.4, assuming that the highest energy optical phonon with hOmax. ~ 92meV °:77-”
dominates the phonon-mediated emission process (i.e., has the strongest optical deformation
potential scattering®’). This theoretical interpretation reduces the magnitude of the UCB’s NEA
by ghOmax.  310meV, the real part of the self-energy shift associated with polaron
formation,’”°!*? so that direct (n = 0) emission from the UCB polaron has an effective electron
affinity of -0.8eV and the (optical)phonon-mediated FC emission is terminated by the lack of
recipient vacuum states at 2 = 8 phonon emissions.’! (We note that the +0.2eV uncertainty our
thin-slab-based” evaluation of the position of the vacuum level (Figure 1) generates a larger
uncertainty in the value of g for the UCB. For example, if yucs ~ —0.9eV, the 280(+25)meV
outer signal MTE value can be attained from the expanded (g > 1) multi-phonon FC emission
analysis using g ~ 2.2 — a 35% lower value.)

As shown by the blue lines in Figure 3, constant MTE values of meV and 290meV, which are
consistent with the kgT< ~ 27meV theoretical expectations for the inner (Figure 3(b)) and outer
(Figure 3(a)) signals respectively, are good fits to the spectral MTE trend in the long transport
regime below ha = 4.5eV. Small exceptions occur at (i) the lowest measured photon energies
where the uncertainty in the extracted MTE values increases due to a reduced emission quantum
efficiency and consequently lower signal-to-noise ratio, and interestingly, (ii) for the inner signal,
around ha ~ 3.8eV where photoexcitation into the LCB from the lower Fe dopant level becomes
possible.*° It is notable that in both cases a low population density of cold electrons is
photoexcited into the bottom of the LCB.

The significantly (~10°x) higher QE of electron emission for the UCB is also expected, even
though this band is weakly populated by a thermalized electron distribution with kpTe ~ 27meV.
First, for FC emission, its NEA nature provides for an intrinsic QE enhancement of around 10°
compared to emission from the LCB**; that is, an effective enhancement of perhaps 10'7-10!8 as
direct (band to vacuum) emission from the LCB dominates. Second, it has a larger density of
states than the LCB leading to a relative population increase. And very importantly, third, the
strong optical deformation potential scattering in B-Ga2O3 will rapidly replenish photoemitted

8
electrons in the UCB, allowing for its much stronger FC electron emission rate to continue as
electrons drift into the ~10nm surface emission region.*® This latter effect is further reinforced
(especially in the short transport regime) by the energy equipartition between electron and optical
phonon modes which results in a significant increase in the phonon population over that present
at a 300K lattice temperature.

respectively (see text). Also included is a dashed line at 25meV for the thermal emittance associated with
300K.
Short Transport Regime

The spectral MTE data (Figure 3) also clearly exhibits the expected discontinuity at ha = 4.5eV
separating the long and short electron transport regimes of the Fe:Ga203(010) photocathode.
Above ha = 4.5eV in the short transport regime, the MTE of both the inner and outer signals
increases linearly with photon energy after an abrupt step-like increase at the transition.
Attention to the dependence of the electron energy kp7e on incident photon energy ho in this
regime*® along with consideration of the dominant emission mechanism allows for a consistent
explanation for both signals.

The outer MTE signal (Figure 3(a)) displays a 70meV increase at hw = 4.5eV indicating a rise in
kpTe to about 95meV, which corresponds well to the highest energy hQmax. » 92meV optical
phonon in B-Ga203.°°””" In fact, the red line in Figure 3(a) is obtained using the expanded
multi-phonon analysis outlined above for FC emission”! directly from the UCB states with

kpTe = AQmax. + = (hw — Ey) and a band gap energy Ez = 4.5eV. This expression for kpTe is

consistent with that used in Ref. 48 for the short transport regime, where (1) a rapid initial energy
equipartition between the photoexcited electrons and optical phonons is presumed and (ii) the net
optical phonon population decay time is assumed to be of the order of or less than mean time for
electron emission. As the QE for NEA FC emission is proportional to at least (kp7¢)’,** the latter
condition is strongly reinforced by the dominance of hot carrier emission, which will then be
reflected in the measured MTE. Since B-Ga2Os3 has / = 8 dominant active optical phonon

modes°?-77-79

and a relatively flat valence band dispersion (Figure 1),°* the initial energy

equipartition of the excess band-to-band photoexcited electron energy, ha — Eg, yields the pre-
2, _ 2 48

3(1+1) 27°

experimental data is consistent with the expected very rapid formation of polarons in the LCB

factor of The additional electron energy contribution of hOmax. = 92meV to fit the

after photoexcitation. In doing so, each electron would transfer gucsh®. (the polaron formation
self-energy) to the photoexcited ‘carrier-polaron’ distribution — resulting in a commensurate
increase in ApTe by energy conservation. In other words, although the photoexcitation is band-to-
band, the electrons are required thereafter to occupy promptly the lowest available state, which
for this strongly polar semiconductor is the polaron about 100meV below the LCB. Our use of
hOmax. = 92meV for this energy contribution is quite consistent with a weighted average optical
phonon energy of 81(+2)meV evaluated from first-principles calculations for optical deformation
potential scattering in B-Ga2O3 ” multiplied by gics = 1.2.% (We note that this contribution to
kpTe is not observable in the long transport regime (a/ < 1) because the vast majority of electrons
in the polaron quasi-particle would have time to cool to AnTe ~ 27meV before emission.)

On the other hand, the inner signal MTE (Figure 3(b)) does not show a commensurate step-like

increase at the ha ~ 4.5eV transition between the long and short transport regimes: the increase

is greater, from 6meV to near 100meV, instead of the expected (2) RQ nax, ¥ 25meV for direct
0

photoemission into the vacuum states.*° This means that the emission process for the inner

10
signal has changed across the 4.5eV transition. Indeed, the new spectral MTE trend in the short
transport regime is now consistent with FC emission from the large PEA LCB with the same
photon energy dependence for ks7e employed for the outer signal originating from the NEA
UCB, yielding MTE © hQmax. + = (hw — E,) as displayed by the red line in Figure 3(b). This
change in emission process is readily explained by considering the LCB electron population
distribution in each transport regime; specifically, the ratio in populations between yLcp and YLcB
+ hOmax. that cannot emit by FC emission using 92meV optical phonons (as no vacuum states
exist) and that at higher energies between yLcB + hOQmax. and the UCB minimum at 1.leV that can
emit by FC emission from the LCB states. In the long transport regime with kpTe ~ 27meV, 40
times more electrons reside in the lower energy bracket, giving a strong bias for direct emission
from the LCB states. However, in the short transport regime with kpTe = hOmax., this ratio is
reduced to less than 2, implying that the emission mechanism with the larger transmission
probability over the photoemission barrier will dominate; in this case, FC emission as its
momentum resonance ensures unity transmission probability.”

Above ha ~ 5eV, there is also some evidence in Figure 3 for a deviation of the MTE from the
= (hw - Eg) linear trend, particularly for the inner signal. This is likely due to the

photoexcitation of electrons into the LCB from a lower valence band located ~0.25eV below the
uppermost valence band at the I point of the Brillouin zone (Figure 1). As these electrons have a
lower excess photoexcitation energy in the LCB, their presence will moderate the increase in
kpTe with ha. However, since the density of states for the lower valence band is less than that of
the upper valence band, the impact of this effect should be delayed until sufficient ‘colder’
electrons can be photoexcited — evidently until ho — Eg > 0.5eV.

Discussion

The intrinsic beam brightness of the inner signal obtained from the Fe:Ga203(010) photocathode
in the long transport regime at 300K is similar to that observed for photoemission from a
Cu(001) photocathode at 35K *°; the latter having an MTE of SmeV and a QE ~ 10° while the
6meV MTE inner signal from the oxide photocathode is associated with ~1% (or less) of the
measured ~10° total beam QE.*° Its strength relative to that of the outer signal could be
enhanced by using surface treatments to reduce the oxide’s work function (i.e., the LCB electron
affinity yrcs). A reduction of | to 1.5eV, by perhaps relatively robust surface methylation or

hydrogenation,*?*!

would generate y ~ 0 for the LCB which should allow significantly more
efficient direct emission of the I’-point photoexcited electron population. This could readily
produce a QE above 0.1% for the inner signal at hw ~ 4.4eV if electron recombination effects are
not too deleterious in this long transport limit — as can certainly be expected as B-Ga2Os crystal
growth quality improves. In contrast, the QE of the outer larger MTE signal from the UCB

should now be in the 10° range as keTe  27meV,"* thus ensuring that the ultra-low MTE inner

11
signal could dominate by more than a factor of 100. To ensure that optical phonon mediated FC
emission from the LCB is still not present to a significant extent, a slightly positive value for
yucs of ~0.leV may need to be employed so that the electron population density between yLcB
and yicB + hOmax. still greatly exceeds that above yLcB + HOmax.. If this cannot be achieved, FC
emission from the LCB will contribute a signal with an MTE of about ?kp7T, ~ 40meV for x ~ 0
(equations (1) and (2))** in the long transport regime, resulting in a net MTE of perhaps 20meV.
We note that a similar increase in the QE using surface treatments is also possible for
Cu(001)*?*3 even at cryogenic temperatures, but at the expense of a significant increase in the
MTE since for metals an increase in QE is only possible with an increase in the excess energy of

photoemission.*735-*4

The time response of the Fe:Ga203(010) photocathode under our experimental conditions can
also be estimated. Prior work on fitting the measured spectral dependence of the QE for this
photocathode*® when hw < 4.5eV indicates that the product of the electron drift velocity and
recombination time, vat, is around 301m — the effective electron ‘escape depth’ in the long
transport regime. For va < 5,000m/s in our internal 1.6kV/cm applied field, this suggests a
response time of ~10ns. In an RF photoelectron gun, the higher field will lead to an electron
drift velocity approaching the saturation drift velocity of ~10°m/s, reducing the response time to
under Ins. However, such high-field transport will also result in an increase in the electron
energy to around 1.5x the 738K Debye temperature®?**> giving kpTe x 90meV so that direct
band emission from the LCB should have an MTE of about 20meV for y = 0. Improvements in
B-Ga203 crystal growth will likely reduce the electron recombination rate into unoccupied
oxygen vacancy states above the Fermi level (Figure 1) but thereby increase the response time.
The use of an optically resonant half-wave thickness,*° 4/2n ~ 70nm *” at ho ~ 4.4eV, for a
higher-quality oxide crystal would cap any response time increase to ~1ns while also improving
the QE by a factor of perhaps 2-3 through an enhancement of the UV irradiance in the bulk
photocathode material. Such an engineered Ga2O3 photocathode placed in a DC gun with a
robust surface treatment to reduce yLcs by leV to ~0.leV could then be expected to yield an
electron beam with a sub-10meV MTE at 300K and with a QE of ~0.1%.

Summary

The measured spectral photoemission properties of a single-crystal and Fe-doped B-Ga203(010)
photocathode display a diversity of emission mechanisms that are well described by theoretical
expectations. Foremost, the experimental investigations at 300K have revealed an ultracold
6meV MTE contribution to its photoemission in the long transport regime (a/ < 1) occurring for
ho <4.5eV. This contribution is due to direct emission from the LCB and consistent with

theoretical expectations*® indicating that MTE ~ (=) kgT, with an electron energy kpTe ~
0

68

27meV reflective of the expected drift transport.°” Although superimposed on a ~10x stronger

12
background with an MTE of ~290meV, the observed inner signal has a transverse beam
brightness an order of magnitude greater than that measured near threshold for a Cu(001)
photocathode at 35K.*° Its QE efficiency relative to the larger signal background, due to optical
phonon mediated FC emission*® from a NEA UCB with yucs = —1.leV and kp7- ~ 27meV, could
be significantly improved by using surface treatments to reduce the work function (i.e., yLcB) by
~leV — likely resulting in sub-10meV MTE emission with a QE ~ 0.1%.

For incident photon energies ha greater than 4.5eV, direct band-to-band absorption results in a
transition to the short transport regime (a/ >> 1), where the higher density of photoexcited
electrons equipartition their excess band energy with the / = 8 dominant optical phonon modes in
B-Ga203,"*””" resulting in the MTEs of both the inner and outer signal being consistent with
FC emission using kgT, = AQmax, + = (hw = Ey) and a band gap energy Eg = 4.5eV. The
transition into the short transport regime therefore also resulted in the inner signal emission
converting from direct band emission to phonon-mediated FC emission — a shift that is readily
explained by a change in electron population distribution to higher band energies as a result of
the step-like increase in kpTe that is consistent with the release of the self-energy gicshQ ~

hOmax. associated with polaron formation. Nonetheless, the inner signal MTE remains below
~150meV for ha < 5.3eV.

In addition to exhibiting an ultracold (sub-77K) contribution to the emitted electron beam at
300K, the single-crystal Fe:Ga203(010) photocathode also demonstrated a clear transition
between the long and short electron transport regimes in a single photoemitting material: the high
electron density short transport regime being associated with band-to-band photoexcitation,
while observation of the low electron density long transport regime was made possible by the
~10'8cm? iron doping necessary to achieve semi-insulating electrical behavior. A similar
spectral transition between transport regimes should also be observed in cesiated GaAs
photocathodes*?* where, due to the low LCB density of states (m* = 0.067mo *8), the absorption
depth for 808nm light is ~1,1m (long transport regime**) and decreases to less than 100nm below
500nm.** Thus, the presented experimental data together with its self-consistent analysis should
be invaluable to Monte-Carlo methods simulating photoemission from GaAs-based
photocathodes* by providing a bridging description between direct band and Franck-Condon
emission. On the other hand, semiconductor photocathodes such as GaN “8 (and B-Ga203) with a
direct band gap and a LCB electron effective mass greater than about 0.2mo are likely to exhibit
short transport regime behavior as soon as direct band-to-band electron photoexcitation is
possible since their absorption depth is rapidly reduced below 100nm for ha > Eg.
