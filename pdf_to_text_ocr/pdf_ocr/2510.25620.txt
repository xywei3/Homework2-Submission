Abstract

The performance of phosphorus-based lubricant additives is governed by their
adsorption, stability, and reactivity at the metal interface. In this study, we
investigate the adsorption behavior and tribochemical stability of three addi-
tives: Octyl Acid Phosphate (OAP), Dibutyl Hydrogen Phosphite (DBHP),
and Amine Neutralized Acid Phosphate (ANAP). These additives are studied
on iron and hematite surfaces using both ab initio calculations and exper-
imental analyses on steel. Simulations revealed that ANAP exhibited the
strongest adsorption on iron, followed by DBHP, while OAP showed weaker
interactions, though its chemisorption was enhanced on hematite via hydro-
gen loss. Under tribological conditions, the DBHP phosphite dissociated
more readily than the other two phosphates molecules due to its lower phos-

phorus coordination, as confirmed by bond order analysis. Quartz crystal

microbalance (QCM) measurements indicated significant differences in ad-
sorption behavior across temperatures, with DBHP forming stable deposits,
while ANAP exhibited poor retention, in agreement with ab initio molec-
ular dynamics simulations. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) con-
firmed DBHP’s strong chemisorption and molecular dissociation, leading to
increased phosphorus deposition. OAP, despite forming a phosphorus-based
layer, caused a reduction in Fe oxide, consistent with its hydrogen release
mechanism observed in simulations. These findings highlight the critical role
of molecular structure and oxidation state in tribofilm formation and stabil-
ity. Understanding these interactions at the atomic level provides valuable
insights for designing high-performance lubricant additives for extreme op-
erating conditions.

1. Introduction

Reducing friction and wear in automotive applications is critical for boost-
ing engine and transmission efficiency. In this context, liquid lubricants are
essential and they are carefully engineered to modify friction and protect the
surfaces of moving components against damage under extreme pressure and
temperature. Their design can significantly improve the energy efficiency in
vehicles, while also adhering to strict environmental regulations and taking
advantage of cutting-edge technological advancements [1].

Modern liquid lubricants are formulated by blending base oils with a range
of molecular additives, each tailored to meet specific performance standards
for different vehicle components. Phosphorus-based additives, in particular,
play a key role due to their unique ability to form protective layers on metal
surfaces, reducing friction and wear under high-stress conditions [2]. Under
conditions of heat and pressure, these additives undergo chemical reactions
that produce thin, durable layers known as tribofilms, which bond tightly
to metal surfaces. These tribofilms help reduce metal-to-metal contact, thus
minimizing wear and prolonging the lifetime of materials.

In this context, phosphorus-based molecules stand out as some of the
most commonly used additives in liquid lubricants. Among these, phos-
phates and phosphites, characterized by phosphorus oxidation states of +5
and +3, respectively, serve distinct roles: organic phosphites primarily func-
tion as friction modifiers, whereas phosphates are more effective as anti-wear
(AW) additives. [3-6]. Within this class of chemically active compounds,
extreme-pressure (EP) additives are essential in boundary lubrication, where
the oil thickness becomes critically thin, risking direct metal-to-metal con-
tact [2, 7, 8]. These protective qualities and durability make phosphorus-
based additives essential for maintaining the efficiency and longevity of crit-
ical engine and transmission components.

In the boundary lubricating regime, scuffing can emerge by forming local
welds between sliding surfaces, causing surges in asperity friction and re-
sulting in damage. It frequently occurs in heavily loaded, high-speed sliding
contacts such as gears, sliding cam-followers, and roller bearings [9]. Many
factors can trigger this phenomenon. For instance, the breakdown of the elas-

tohydrodynamic (EHL) film and tribofilms that separate rubbing surfaces is
a common cause. Other changes in contact conditions like increasing load,
speed, temperature, or the introduction of solid contaminants can lead to
scuffing. Nowadays, the resistance to scuffing is particularly relevant in the
development of lubricants for high-speed electric vehicle transmissions [10].

Extensive research has explored the factors contributing to EHL film
breakdown. However, the processes governing tribofilm formation, removal,
and their impact on scuffing remain only partially understood [11]. Tribofilms
generated by EP and AW additives, especially those based on phosphorus,
have been shown to play a crucial role in mitigating scuffing. Their compo-
sition and durability are critical in controlling scuffing, as a stable tribofilm
can resist breakdown even under extreme operating conditions [12]. Under-
standing the dynamics of tribofilm formation and removal is essential for
advancing scuffing resistance strategies, paving the way for creating more
resilient lubricants in automotive applications.

This study aims to offer a comprehensive insight into the molecular-level
interaction between phosphorus-based lubricant additives and iron, specifi-
cally emphasizing their role in preventing scuffing. Combining experimental
data obtained by Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) and X-ray photo-
electron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques with ab initio calculations can help
uncover the tribochemical processes leading to scuffing and ways to prevent
it. In particular, we compared three different molecules typically employed
as anti-wear additives in commercial formulations: Dibutyl Hydrogen Phos-
phite (DBHP), Octyl Acid Phosphate (OAP) and an amine-neutralized acid
phosphate (ANAP) (Fig. 1). Together with their interaction with Fe and

hematite, we investigated the stability of their internal bonds to predict their
effect in tribological applications.

2. Methods

2.1. Computational methods

The calculations were performed utilizing spin-polarized Density Func-
tional Theory (DFT) implemented in version 7.2 of the Quantum Espresso
suite [13-15]. The exchange-correlation functional was specified using the
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) within the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof
(PBE) parametrization [16]. The use of this functionals class is common in
computational tribology and has been compared with other setups, result-
ing to be efficient in producing results confirmed by experiments, especially
when combined with Van der Waals corrections [17, 18]. In this work, two
distinct computational setups were employed, one for the (001) hematite
surface description and another for the remaining calculations.

For the (001) hematite surface description, we employed DFT+U [19]
with a Hubbard parameter set to 4.2 eV, a choice aligned with previous
studies on adsorption on hematite [20, 21] and specifically suitable for the
Vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials used. The kinetic energy cutoff for the
wave functions was established at 50 Ry, with a charge density cutoff of 400
Ry. The spin of d electrons localized on Fe atoms was assigned to depict
the antiferromagnetic nature of this material [22]. Additionally, a Gaussian
smearing with a width of 0.02 Ry was applied.

For all other calculations, we employed standard DFT. The kinetic energy
cutoff for the wave functions was set to 40 Ry, with a charge density cutoff of

320 Ry. A Gaussian smearing with a width of 0.001 Ry was incorporated to
enhance the description of occupations around the Fermi level. The electronic
configuration of atoms was represented by ultrasoft pseudopotentials within
the RRKJ parametrization [23]. We computed the adsorption energies by
considering calculations with and without the addition of van der Waals
corrections. In the former case, we exploited a customized modification of
the Grimme D2 dispersion correction scheme, denoted as Dg |24, 25]. This
modification deviates from the standard D2 primarily in terms of the Cg
coefficient and the van der Waals radius Ro of the Fe atoms. Notably, these
parameters are substituted with those of Ar (argon), the noble gas preceding
Fe.

To investigate the molecular adsorption on iron surfaces, we utilized
large 6 x 8 orthorhombic supercells to prevent unintended lateral interac-
tions among replicas. Each slab represented a (110) Fe surface consisting
of four layers containing 48 atoms each. Additionally, we incorporated a
substantial void in each cell to ensure a vertical separation of at least 10 A
between replicas. The resulting supercell dimensions were 17.10 A x 16.12 A
x 30.78 A, determined after optimizing a smaller 2 x 2 cell. Given the large
size of the supercell, we optimized it by sampling solely at the [ point. We
identified the most favorable binding site and molecular orientation using a
software to automatize the adsorption studies, Xsorb [26], and computed the

adsorption energies using the formula:

Eads = tot _ (Eeub a Bivisortuve) (1)

where Fiz is the energy of the optimized system comprising the substrate

and the adsorbed molecule/atom, and Fs.5 (Eadsorbate) is the energy of the
isolated substrate (adsorbate).

We also performed ab initio Molecular Dynamics Simulations (AIMD)
using a modified version of the Quantum Espresso code to simulate tribolog-
ical conditions [27| with the same computational parameters as for the static
calculations. During the AIMD simulations, the bottom atomic layer of the
lower slab was fixed, while a constant velocity of 200 m/s was imposed to
the uppermost layer of the counter-surface. We also applied a vertical force
to the atoms of the uppermost layer to impose an external normal pressure
of 2 GPa. In the initial configurations, a single molecule of any additive type
considered in this study was adsorbed on the iron substrate in its most stable
configuration. The system underwent relaxation under an applied pressure
of 500 MPa, followed by a equilibration at a constant temperature of 300 K
with a timestep of 1 fs. This setup is analogous to the one employed to study
trimethylphosphite (TMP) interacting with iron [6].

In order to compare the strength of different bonds within the molecule,
we evaluated the energetic costs associated to different cuts. To do so, we per-
formed static calculations at frozen ionic positions of the isolated fragments
in vacuum. The fragmentation energy AF, corresponding to the energy re-

quired to break each bond, is calculated as:

N
AE =)° Ey, — Emot- (2)

n=1

in which N denotes the number of fragments obtained for each of the
investigated cuts, E;, is the calculated energy of each fragment (identified
by n), and Ejnor is the energy of the isolated molecule. Finally, we per-

formed bond order analysis and crystal orbital overlap population exploiting
the software LOBSTER [28-31]. To do so, we evaluated the integrated Crys-
tal Orbital Bond Index (ICOBI) and the integrated Crystal Orbital Overlap
Population (ICOOP). To account for the charged nature of the two compo-
nents of the ANAP, we set an initial —1 (+1) charge on the O (H) atoms in

component a (b).

2.2. Experimental methods

To properly characterize the film formed on the metallic surfaces, Quartz
Crystal Microbalance (QCM) has been used to deposit the AW additives of
the lubricant. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) is then performed

to determine film composition and chemistry.

2.2.1. Quartz Crystal Microbalance sample preparation

For this study, we used quartz crystal sensors coated with stainless steel
$$2343 (QSX304, BiolinScientific AB, Sweden). The quartz crystal sensors
are mounted into the QCM-D flow modules (QSense Explorer, BiolinScien-
tific, Sweden). Two types of chambers are used, one for ambient tempera-
tures (30 °C) and the other for high temperatures (90 °C). The oscillation
frequency (f) of the quartz crystals was measured for the fundamental fre-
quency (5 MHz) and for six overtones in air until the base line was stabilized
(Af over 10 min less than 2.0 Hz). Then, base oil was pumped into the flow
module at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. After frequency stabilization, a solution
of AW (0.1%w DBHP, 0.5%w OAP and 1%w ANAP) in base oil is pumped
for approximately 30 min for the evaluation of their interaction with the
stainless-steel surface, followed by pumping pure base oil for rinsing until the

signal stabilized. In this apparatus, the sensor is a thin quartz disc with gold
electrodes evaporated on each one of its opposing surfaces. It oscillates at its
resonance frequency when the corresponding alternating current is applied.
Molecular adsorption at the electrode surface causes a change in the sensor
mass that results in a linear change of its oscillation frequency when the ad-
sorbate is solid-like. The relation is shown in Eq.3, where m is the Sauerbrey
sensed mass (in mg m7?) calculated from the third overtone, n being the
overtone number (dimensionless), the measured frequency f (in Hz) and the
constant C (in this case 0.177 mg m~?z~')[32-34]. Thus, the real-time
frequency changes measured by the QCM setup allow the appreciation of the

ongoing surface phenomena.

2.2.2. X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
XPS analysis was performed with a Thermo NEXSA spectrometer (Thermo

Electron, USA) to obtain the surface composition through survey and high-
resolution spectra of the Cls, Ols, P2p, Nis, Fe2p core levels. The X-ray
excitation was the Al-Ka line at 1486.7 eV. The detection of the photoelec-
trons was perpendicular to the sample surface. The spot size was 400 ym.
Flood gun was turned on for charge compensation in all adsorbate deposit
samples. Material homogeneity has been checked by studying 2 different

spots on each sample.

DBHP is characterized by a phosphite unit with two terminating primary

CeHieN (b.).

3.1. Adsorption and dissociation on Fe
3.1.1. Adsorption configurations and energies on iron

We initially simulated the adsorption of the molecules on bare iron. Once
we identified the best adsorption configuration using Xsorb, we computed the
associated adsorption energy F,a,; and found that the strongest interaction

is obtained for the amine neutralized acid phosphate, followed by DBHP.

11
OAP interacted more weakly with iron. The optimal adsorption configura-
tions are reported in panels a) to c) of Fig. 2. We also performed all the
adsorption calculations accounting for vdW interactions, with the results re-
ported in Tab. 1. The dispersion interactions lead to an energy decrease for
all configurations, while maintaining the energy trends and the geometrical

configurations.

energy values are reported in the picture.

3.1.2. Effects of substrate oxidation

We then simulated the adsorption of the additives on hematite in order
to find out how much the substrate oxidation can affect the binding strength
of these molecules. Due to the high computational cost associated with

hematite simulation, we reduced the size of the molecules by replacing the

long alkyl chains with methyl groups, allowing to reduce the lateral size of
the substrate supercell. This approach has been already adopted by our
group to study the adsorption and dissociation of lubricant additives (i.e.,
MoDTC, ZDDP) over different substrates [35, 36]. Those studies showed that
the energetics for molecules having methyl groups and longer alkyl chains in
the ligand units are similar as the chemisorption strength is governed by the
functional group. The shortened versions of the molecules are here denoted

with a star symbol (*).

14
As can be seen in the first column of Tab. 2, the adsorption energies ob-
tained for the shortened molecules on Fe(110) surface are in agreement with
those obtained for the longer-chain molecules (indicated in the upper panel
of Fig. 2), confirming the minor role played by alkyl chains compared to the
functional groups of the molecules [18, 35]. The adsorption configurations
on hematite are reported in the lower panel of Fig. 2, including the adsorp-
tion energies. These values are compared with those obtained for the same
shortened molecules on iron in Tab. 2. The overall adsorption trend between
the two substrates is maintained, with the largest difference arising in the
case of *OAP. This molecule, which was found to weakly interact with the
Fe substrate, now appears to lose an H atom which is chemisorbed to the
hematite substrate, enhancing the interaction and leading to Eygs = —2.12
eV. Indeed, Fe oxides are known to interact strongly with molecules which
are capable of losing H atoms, inducing the removal of O atoms from the
surface to form HO [37]. This will be further explained in this context by

the XPS results combined with the QCM experiments in the last section.

3.1.3. Effects of molecular coverage

For specific molecules characterized by a reactive head (“head group”) and
a long alkyl chain (“tail group”), the energy gain associated to the formation
of a self-assembled monolayer can lower the adsorption energy on a substrate.
Experimental results suggest that this may be the case for the OAP, which
is able to form a self-assembled monolayer at high concentrations on cerium
conversion coating on galvanized steel [38]. For this reason, even though a

vertical orientation is energetically less favorable for a single OAP molecule

15
adsorbed on Fe compared to the horizontal one (—0.86 eV vs —0.95 eV), we
tested the adsorption energy per molecule when the coverage is increased for
both orientations.

Including vdW corrections for a better description of the intermolecular
interaction, we obtained Ea; = —1.31 eV for a single vertical molecule ad-
sorbed on the surface and Eygs = —1.43 eV per molecule when 6 molecules
were simultaneously adsorbed on the same supercell (Fig. 3). These findings
suggest that, at higher coverages approaching a self-assembled monolayer,
the vertical orientation of OAP becomes energetically comparable to the

horizontal configuration (Haas = —1.62 eV).

3.2. Molecular dynamics simulations

We performed AIMD simulations to evaluate the most likely dissociation
paths of OAP, DBHP, and ANAP adsorbed on a metallic substrate. To ac-
celerate and enhance the chemical reaction processes, we decided to simulate
each molecule confined within an iron interface in tribological environments
i.e., under applied temperatures, normal loads, and shear stresses), which
are the typical operating conditions for these compounds. Key snapshots of
he simulations are shown in Fig. 4. The total simulation time is equal to
1 ps. To reduce computational costs, we employed the shortened version of
he molecules.

It is immediate to see in Fig. 4a that *~DBHP had the weakest bonds to

break, thus exhibiting the highest reactivity in tribological conditions. In
particular, its behaviour was similar to trimethyl phosphite, thanks to their
similar chemical structures, as observed previously by our group [6]. Specifi-

cally, the alkoxy chains were detached from the head group and chemisorbed

onto the substrate due to the mechanical stresses applied in the system, leav-
ing the central P—O fragment interacting with the iron slabs. Conversely,
bonds within *OAP demonstrated a higher stability under these harsh con-
ditions and did not dissociate (Fig. 4b). Nevertheless, the hydrogen atoms in
the OH group dissociated and adsorbed onto the surface, in analogy to what
we found in the static calculations performed on hematite. Finally, also the
P in the *ANAP head group did not dissociate (Fig. 4c), likely due to the
synergistic effect of its two ions. Like *OAP, *ANAP only loses hydrogen
atoms that chemisorb onto the surface.

The qualitative analysis of the dissociation paths suggested that a higher
coordination number for the central phosphorus with oxygen atoms (as in
OAP and the phosphate anion in ANAP) helps in stabilizing the phosphorus-
based molecules compared to those coordinated with only three oxygen atoms

(as in DBHP and trimethyl phosphite).

3.3. Strength of molecular bonds

To quantitatively confirm the different dissociation path between three-
and four-fold coordinated phosphorous groups emerged in AIMD simulations,
we evaluated the energy costs AE, defined in Eq. 2, to cut each atomic bond
in the different molecules. These energy differences do not represent the
energy barriers required for molecular dissociation, but rather an evaluation
of the relative stability of different bonds. The cuts tested (alkyl, alkoxy,
hydrogen, hydroxyl, and oxygen removal) and the AE values obtained are
reported in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6.

In agreement with the AIMD simulations, the OAP required the highest

amount of energy to break its bonds for each of the cuts investigated. Fig. 5

shows two cuts corresponding to the alkyl- and alkoxy-chain removal. In both
cases, the same cut requires the smallest amount of energy for DBHP (2.31
eV and 3.07 eV) and the highest for OAP (4.55 eV and 4.12 eV), suggesting
a higher stability for the latter. Moreover, the alkoxy-chain removal across
all molecules (Figs. 5a-c) was less energetically costly than the alkyl removal
(Figs. 5d-e), with the exception for OAP. The removal of the alkoxy chains
was always energetically less expensive than the P—O breaking shown in
Fig. 6c, suggesting that the head group subunits (like OH and H Figs. 6a-b)
were more stable and difficult to break compared to the alkoxy-chains. These
findings could be relevant to understand which is the driving mechanism of
tribofilm formation for other lubricant additives containing alkoxy chains [39—
41] since this functional group seemed the easiest to break.

The higher bond strengths in OAP compared to other molecules was also
confirmed by the bond order analyses reported in Tab. 3. The ICOBI values
provided insight into the nature and strength of chemical bonds, identifying
which ones are single or double-bonded. The different P-O bonds for the
studied molecules are labelled as shown in Fig. 1. In our case, we can indicate
a single bond when ICOBI values range from 0.76 to 0.80, whereas values
between 1.31 and 1.33 correspond to double bonds. As shown in the ICOBI
columns of Tab. 3, the oxygen terminated bonds (P—O1 for the OAP, P-O2
for the DBHP) were always identified as double bonds, with the remaining
ones classified as single bonds. In the phosphorus-based fragment of the
ANAP, we classified two single and two double covalent bonds. The ICOBI
values of the latter fall between those computed for double bonds in OAP

and DBHP. (1.02 and 1.01 for P-O1 and P—O2 bonds, respectively). These

20
intermediate values can be attributed to the charged nature of this fragment,
which leads to a redistribution of the additional negative charge.

On the other hand, the ICOOP analysis allowed to evaluate the bond
strengths of the P—O bonds across the different molecules, i.e., which bonds
are stronger or weaker within the molecule. The ICOOP columns in Ta-
ble 3 shows that the strength for the P—O bonds in OAP, both single- and
double-bonded, is consistently larger than in DBHP, indicating a stronger
P-O interaction for the former. In contrast, the phosphate anion of ANAP
exhibited a hybrid behaviour, with ICOOP values closer to DBPH for the
double P-O bonds and a stronger interaction for single P-O bonds, similar
to OAP. The ICOBI and ICOOP analyses supported the AIMD simulations,
confirming that four-fold coordinated head groups had the strongest bonds,
thus increasing their stability compared to three-fold coordinated groups and

requiring the highest energy cost to dissociate.

3.4. Experimental correlation

QCM measurements have been performed, for each solution, at temper-
atures of 30 °C and 90 °C respectively. Results are reported in Fig. 7. It
must be noticed that the adsorption behavior is very different at these two

temperatures and for the different phosphorus-based chemistry.

°C (blue line) and 90 °C (red line). * symbols indicate the base oil time rinsing.

Concerning ANAP, shown in Fig. 7a, a small frequency drop is observed
both at 30 °C (-14 Hz) and at 90 °C (-2.5 Hz). Besides, a complete desorption
is observed when rinsed with base oil. These observations may result from
a weak interaction between ANAP and the metallic surface due to a low
physisorption interaction. Different frequency drops between 30 °C and 90 °C
must come from a solubility difference of the molecule in the base oil. Indeed,
at higher temperature, solubility will increase and will result in a decrease of
interaction between the AW and the metallic surface. For DBHP in Fig. 7b,
a slow adsorption kinetics is observed at 30 °C, whereas at 90 °C a large
and continuous frequency drop is measured. This behavior could result from
the DBHP reactivity under temperature stress which leads to a large deposit

formation. Note that for these two experiments, no base oil rinsing has been

22
performed. Finally, for OAP in Fig. 7c, a frequency increase is observed
both at 30 °C and 90 °C. At higher temperature, the kinetic is faster than
at ambient temperature. Usually, an increase in the QCM frequency shift
is related to a loss of mass. After base oil rinsing step, frequency remains
stable which means that the system is not going back to the initial state. To
understand this mass loss, XPS analysis has been performed to characterize

AW /substrate interface obtained at 90 °C (see Tab. 4).

First, it must be noted that an organic contamination layer is present on
top of the raw substrate that is used for this study. Nitrogen atoms are also
detected which may come from the stainless-steel deposit process. Moreover,
the stainless steel reference showed a high concentration of oxygen, which
suggests the presence of a iron oxide layer over the metal surface. For ANAP
deposit, elemental composition is close to the one of pristine stainless-steel
surface. This result is in great agreement with the adsorption mechanism
measured in QCM as a complete AW desorption is observed when rinsed
with base oil. This result is also correlated with simulation data, where we

identified a relevant molecular adsorption with no chemical reactivity under

23
tribological conditions. For DBHP deposit, a large amount of P is detected
which confirms the high reactivity at 90 °C. Here again, the result is in
great agreement with AIMD simulations as they have shown that phosphite
exhibits the highest chemical reactivity. For OAP deposit, as for DBHP,
a P-based layer is observed which does not explain the mass loss observed
on QCM data. Moreover, the Fe amount detected via XPS is quite low
with a P/Fe ratio above 1. This result shows that OAP additive adsorbs
on the surface which must induce a mass increase that should be measured
via QCM. Yet QCM data for OAP is not showing a mass adsorption, that
is why further analysis on the substrate chemistry will be presented later.
From XPS elemental analysis, it must be also noted that C/P ratio for OAP
is equal to 6.4 (in theory 8 as presented in Figure 1) whereas for DBHP,
the C/P ratio is equal to 0.9. This shows clearly that at high temperature,
DBHP is degraded to form mainly a P-based layer at the surface, while losing
the C chain.

As simulation data for the OAP additive suggested the release of hydrogen
atoms over the metal surface, an XPS analysis of the iron oxide layer variation
has been performed, with the results shown in Fig. 8.

The Fe2p3/2 peak measured via XPS clearly shows the different iron
states within the stainless steel reference: 707 eV for metallic Fe and around
711 eV for oxidized Fe. We want to remark again, as shown in Tab. 4, that
even if the experimental work has been performed on a stainless-steel surface,
the iron chemistry shows a higher amount of iron oxide, which is in agreement
with a hematite-type top surface. The interaction between the different AW

additives and the substrate dramatically changed the shape of the Fe2p3/2

peaks: for example, in the stainless-steel and ANAP case, no differences
were observed in the peak shape and position, which confirms that there is
no significant reactivity for this additive over the substrate. It is worth noting
that for DBHP, a shift is observed at Fe edge but not at P edge. This could
be explained by a differential charge effect between the steel and the thick
P-based layer surfaces. It also confirms the reactivity of DBHP under high
‘emperature. This suggest a tendency to molecular dissociation promoted
by temperature, a mechanism which might as well be enhanced by the harsh

ribological conditions of load and shear simulated in the AIMD. Indeed,

he molecule appeared to dissociate almost immediately in this simulation,
leaving P chemisorbed on Fe as well as its two alkoxy chains which could
explain both the high P content and the mass increase recorded in the QCM
experiments. Finally, for OAP, the peak associated with the oxidation state
decreased while the corresponding metallic contribution increased compared
to the reference surface. Thus, it indicates that this AW additive reacts with
Fe oxide. This result is in agreement with the OAP adsorption that leads
to a surface reduction and lose of oxide layer. The QCM behavior presented
in figure Fig.7c is then the results of both mass loss from surface oxide and
mass increase from the OAP adsorption: the mass loss being higher than the
masse increase, the behavior globally conducts to a mass loss. Comparing
this with the results obtained by ab initio analysis, in which a release of H
from the molecule occurred both in the adsorption on hematite and in the
molecular dynamics simulation on iron, we can hypothesize a removal of the
Fe oxide surface layer due to the reducing effect of H, explaining the mass

loss associated to an increase in the frequency measured by QCM.

4. Conclusions

This study focuses on the adsorption and stability of three phosphorus-
based lubricant additives, OAP, DBHP, and ANAP, on iron and hematite
substrates. Through ab initio calculations, we found that ANAP, followed
by DBHP, exhibited the strongest interaction with bare iron, while OAP dis-
played a weaker adsorption on both substrates. The adsorption trends were
consistent across Fe and hematite substrates, with a notable enhancement
for OAP on hematite, where the interaction was facilitated by the loss of a
hydrogen atom.

Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations showed that DBHP dissociated
more easily than OAP and ANAP when interacting with iron surfaces under
tribological conditions. This effect was attributed to the lower phosphorus
coordination of the phosphite molecule with respect to the phosphate ones,
which promotes molecular dissociation. We confirmed these results with a
bond order analyses, where we found the P—O bond in OAP has the highest
strength, confirming that it was less prone to dissociation.

Experimental QCM and XPS analyses further validated our results. No-
tably, DBHP demonstrated the highest P/Fe ratio, consistent with its strong
chemisorption and dissociative behavior observed in simulations. Conversely,
OAP exhibited a loss in mass and reduction in Fe oxide peak, suggesting a
removal of surface oxides through the release of hydrogen, as observed in the
simulations.

Overall, this approach shows that ab initio calculations can provide valu-
able information to understand the mechanisms of adsorption and reaction of

additives on ferrous substrates. Indeed, the results here presented turned out

27
to be in very good agreement with the experimental observations. In particu-
lar, we highlight how molecular structure and oxidation states of phosphorus
additives affect molecular adsorption which is the first step for tribofilm for-
mation, providing valuable insights for the design of lubricants tailored to

prevent scuffing and enhance performance under diverse conditions.
