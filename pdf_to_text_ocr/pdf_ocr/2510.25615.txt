Quantum coherence, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, is of paramount importance for quantum informa-
tion protocols. However, maintaining coherence in elementary particle systems presents significant challenges.
In this work, we investigate quantum coherence and quantum correlations in the e*e~ > AA processes at BE-
SIII using experimentally feasible parameters, where A and A denote the spin-1/2 hyperon and its antihyperon,
respectively. We analyze the dependence of quantum coherence and quantum correlations on the scattering an-
gle y. Notably, these resources reach their maximum at y = 2/2. We demonstrate that classical correlations can
significantly delay the decay of quantum correlations and coherence. This study underscores the importance of
understanding the interplay between classical and quantum correlations in high-energy particle physics, partic-
ularly in the context of hyperon-antihyperon interactions explored in the BESIII experiment. This result could
have potential applications in quantum information processing and high-energy physics.

I. INTRODUCTION

Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) famously challenged the completeness of quantum mechanics in their 1935 thought
experiment. This paradox highlighted the presence of non-local correlations between quantum systems, suggesting that a mea-
surement on one system could instantaneously affect the state of another system, even if they are spatially separated [1]. In
response, Schrédinger introduced the concepts of entanglement and quantum steering, which provided a profound explanation
of the non-local correlations intrinsic to quantum mechanics [2]. Bell’s theorem further demonstrated that local hidden variable
theories fail to account for all nonlocal correlations observed between spatially separated systems under local quantum measure-
ments [3]. Entanglement, a purely quantum phenomenon with no classical equivalent, establishes correlations between parts
of a multipartite quantum system. This unique resource is essential for numerous tasks in quantum information science [4].
Beyond entanglement, other quantum correlations, including quantum non-locality without entanglement, have been shown to
be valuable for quantum technology [5, 6]. Theoretical [7] and experimental [8] studies have shown that some separable states
can outperform classical counterparts in specific tasks. This necessitates a broader investigation of quantum correlations.

Until recent years, it was widely believed that quantum correlations were closely tied to quantum entanglement, and the manip-
ulation of quantum information was generally addressed within the framework of entanglement and separability [8]. However,
various studies have shown that entanglement is not the only type of correlation useful for the implementation of quantum pro-
tocols, and some separable states can also outperform their classical counterparts [9, 10]. This has led to the development of
new quantifiers to detect nonclassical correlations beyond entanglement, thereby enhancing our ability to manipulate quantum
information [11]. The steerability of the two entangled bipartite states is assessed using quantum steering. This quantifier high-
lights the asymmetric relationship between Alice and Bob, two entangled observers. By exploiting their shared entanglement,
Alice can thus modify (i.e., ’steer”) Bob’s state [12, 13]. However, these nonclassical correlations are sensitive to environmental
disturbances, leading to decoherence, which disrupts quantum states and facilitates the transition to classical behavior [14].

The Geometric Quantum Discord (GQD) is a measure of quantum correlations in bipartite systems, designed to capture more
general non-classical correlations beyond quantum entanglement. Geometric methods are frequently employed to define and
measure quantum resources in a multitude of quantum systems [15]. Specifically, the Schatten 1-norm quantum discord [16, 17],
is a reliable geometric-based indicator used to assess the level of quantum correlations in metal complexes [18]. Unlike other
correlation measures, it takes into account the geometry of the quantum state space. This approach allows quantifying quantum
correlations in a way that considers the geometric structure of the quantum state space, which can provide richer information
about quantum interactions. GQD has been widely studied both theoretically and experimentally, offering interesting prospects
for the characterization and utilization of quantum resources in various contexts of quantum information processing and quantum
communication [19, 20].

Quantum coherence is indeed a fundamental concept in quantum physics, enabling a system to exist in a superposition of
states, which is essential for various quantum phenomena, including interference and quantum optics [21, 22]. This property is
not only crucial for theoretical understanding but also constitutes a valuable resource in many areas of research. For example, in

“Electronic address: m.amazioug @uiz.ac.ma
quantum thermodynamics [23, 24], quantum dots [25, 26], Heisenberg spin chains [27, 28], spin waves [29], quantum batteries
[30], and even for developing algorithms for quantum computing [31, 32]. These applications highlight the importance of
quantum coherence in many areas of quantum physics and its technological applications.

Studies on quantum entanglement have been conducted with low-energy protons in [33], while [34] explores the possibility
of achieving entanglement at colliders through the analysis of hadronic final states. The investigation of quantum entanglement
extends to even smaller length scales at higher energies, as demonstrated in [35]. In the field of high-energy physics, various
experimental approaches have been proposed to investigate quantum entanglement, such as those utilizing neutral kaon physics
[36-39], positronium [40], flavor oscillations in neutral B mesons [41], charmonium decays [42], and neutrino oscillations [43].
Recently, the entanglement in top quark pair production is observation at the LHC [44]. Furthermore, [45] established the
experimental feasibility of observing Bell inequality violations within this system. In this regard, the study of entanglement has
been proposed in high energy physics, including top quark production [46-50], hyperon production [51], and the production of
gauge bosons, whether through Higgs boson decay [52-55] or direct production mechanisms [54, 55].

A novel approach to studying the decays of strange baryons is based on the investigation of hyperon-antihyperon pairs pro-
duced from J/w resonances in electron-positron collisions [56]. The angular distribution of these processes can be compactly
described using real-valued matrices, which represent both the initial spin-entangled state of the baryon-antibaryon pair and the
weak two-body decay chains. These matrices, being modular, can be rearranged to model various decay scenarios, such as the
processes e*e™ > AA and similar ones [56-59]. The BESIII experiment, conducted with an electron-positron collider, has
performed extensive analyses of these angular distributions using multidimensional maximum-likelihood fits within this mod-
ular framework [60, 61]. These studies have opened new avenues for exploring fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics,
such as nonlocality and quantum entanglement [62, 63]. Furthermore, the interest in studying quantum correlations in hyperon-
antihyperon systems has been growing [64, 65], particularly thanks to recent technological advancements in the BESIII detector.
These upgrades enable more precise observations of entangled phenomena arising from electron-positron collisions [66, 67].

The charmonium states, particularly J/y and y(2S ), are vital sources of spin-entangled hyperon-antihyperon pairs, which are
essential for studying the hyperon decay parameters and CP symmetry violations in the baryon sector [68]. The recent BESIII
experiment has made significant progress by observing polarization in the decay process ete~ > J/w > AA, which allowed for
the simultaneous determination of the decay asymmetries for A and A [69, 70]. Notably, the recently measured decay asymmetry
parameter for A — pa™ reveals significant deviations from previous values, suggesting that prior assessments of the polarization
of A and A may have been overestimated by approximately (17 + 3)% [57]. These results emphasize the need to reevaluate the
angular distributions and decay asymmetries in related weak decay processes, thereby enhancing our understanding of strong
and weak interactions in particle physics.

In this study, we examine the quantum coherence and quantum correlations in the process e*e~ > J/y > AA during the
BESIII experiment, where A and A represent the spin-1/2 hyperon and its antihyperon, respectively. Our analysis is based on
the two-qubit density operator for the AA system. We show that quantum coherence and quantum correlations depend on the
scattering angle y. Furthermore, we illustrate the decoherence dynamics of the hyperon-antihyperon system AA when subjected
to a classically correlated dephasing channel. Specifically, describing a channel as classically correlated refers to the existence
of classical correlations between its successive actions on the hyperon and the antihyperon AA. Within this framework, we
demonstrate that these classical correlations effectively delay the decay of quantum correlations and coherence.

The article is organized as follows: in section II, we describe the physical model used for a AA pair. Section IV provides
an overview of the concepts related to quantum steering, entanglement of formation, geometric quantum discord, and quantum
coherence, considering the AA system in both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. A comparison of the quantum resources
between these two regimes is presented in section V, finally, the conclusions are summarized in section VI.

II. THEORETICAL MODEL

Vector charmonia, including J/ or y(2S), are observed to decay into hyperon-antihyperon pairs, forming a massive two-
qubit system YY, consisting of two spin-1/2 particles. The hyperon and antihyperon are emitted with opposite momenta in
the center-of-mass (CP) frame due to momentum conservation. A two-qubit density operator describes the spin state of the
hyperon-antihyperon pair [57]

peron, respectively, and C;, j being their correlation matrix. The density matrix 6,7 (Eq. (1)), can be re-written as

III. PRELIMINARY OF CORRELATED QUANTUM CHANNEL

This section summarizes the preliminary concepts relevant to characterizing correlated quantum channels. To simplify the
analysis, we consider a two-qubit system that is initially prepared in the state 6(0). We consider two qubits passing through
channel Z, resulting in an output state described by a map if the channel acts identically on each qubit [72]

where oo = diag(1,1) is the 2 x 2 identity matrix, and 7 ,,, denote the Pauli operators. The values p; form a probability

Pig = CL — pi; + HPIO:,;, (10)
where 6;,; is the Kronecker delta, and 0 < yz < 1 quantifies the classical correlations between consecutive applications of the
operation ¢ to the two qubits. This model incorporates the effects of standard uncorrelated dephasing. We consider the dephasing
channel with probabilities pp = 1 — p, px, = 0, and p, = p. To explore the time-dependent quantum coherence, we examine a
colored pure dephasing model with a time-dependent Hamiltonian [72]

H(t) = hl (ho-, (11)

where I(t) = wm(f) is a random telegraph signal, with m(t) following a Poisson distribution with mean (m(f)) = t/(2T), and w is
a coin-flip random variable that can take either the value +w. For w = 1, the time-dependent factor p is given by

p=[1-K@]/2 (12)

IV. QUANTUM CORRELATION MEASURES

This section explores the use of the hyperon-antihyperon spin density operator to examine various quantum properties in
the AA system, including quantum steering, entanglement of formation, geometric quantum discord, and quantum coherence.
However, we have chosen to focus on A because the results obtained from this decay are representative of the trends observed for
other hyperons. In particular, the quantum correlations and coherence effects extracted from the decay of A exhibit similarities

with those arising from the decays of ©”, =”, and &. This choice allows us to simplify the analysis without any loss of generality
while highlighting the main physical effects studied in this work.

This similarity has been confirmed through comparative analyses and is consistent with previous experimental/theoretical
results [57].
A. Quantum steering

Quantum steering describes correlations where measurements on one particle (at A) seem to instantaneously influence the
state of a distant particle (at A). Given a shared two-qubit state 6,x between Alice and Bob, we examine the possibility of
steering. Alice can demonstrate steering to Bob if the steering operators 7), and 7x, are defined as follows [79]

TA = Salas +(1 - <a) q17)
and

x L. x 1)\,

TAA = wae + (: 7 saan (18)

where 6, = 3 @ ox and 6, = EA ®@ 3. with oq = tra(G,aq) and Oa = tra(6,q) being the reduced states for Bob and Alice,
respectively. By simple calculation, we find that the matrix 7x, for an X-state is

where 5 = EB, + 622) and q = 28655 + 644).
The above state, 7,, is entangled if it satisfies one of the following inequalities [79, 80]

where

fe = 7 O1.104.4 + —z— 62.263,3 + qu + 64,4)(62,2 + 633). (21c)
Similarly, steering from Alice to Bob is verified by one of the following inequalities
Ind 1.47 > fat fo» (22a)
Indrsl? > fo + fo- (22b)

The steerability of Bob to Alice, denoted by Sj,q, is given by [79]

The steerability from Alice to Bob, S,,4, given by
Syq = max {0 = [hn..4!? - fa - for Oral? - fe - Al} i (24)
The steering asymmetry is defined as

5S = |Sax — Sial- (25)

The steerability between qubit (A) (Alice) and qubit (A) (Bob) can be classified into distinct cases:
e With 6S > 0 (one-way steering), either Alice can steer Bob (S,q > 0 and Sx, = 0) or Bob can steer Alice (S,q = 0 and
Sxa > 0).

e When 6S = 0 (two-way or no-way steering), either S,q = Sq = 0 (no steering) or Sax = Sx, > 0 (two-way steering).

We first examine the quantum steerability of the hyperon-antihyperon system, characterized by its spin density operator (Eq. 15)
as a function of the classical parameter yz (with g = 7/2) and the scattering angle y (with 4 = 0.8). The condition 622 = 633
leads to f, = 0 according to Eq. (21b). Asa result, the steerabilities from A to A (Eq. (23)) and from A to A (Eq. (24)) are equal,
Le., Saq = Sqq = max {o, Ba [Ina — far Ino23P - ral This equality implies that 6S = 0, indicating that the steerability
between A and A is bidirectional (two-way or no-way steering).

Figure 2(a) shows the steerability S,, as a function of both time and the diffusion angle y in the Markovian regime. The
steerability peaks at y = 2/2 and diminishes monotonically as time progresses or y moves away from 7/2.

This form allows us to determine the values of f,, fp, and f. in equations (21a), (21b), and (21c), respectively

We observe that the inequalities given in equations (22a) and (22b) are not satisfied.
Moreover, the sterability between the qubits A and A is found to be zero

Sax = Sxa = 0.

Figure 2(b) explores the behavior of the steerability S,, as a function of time and the classical correlation parameter y in
the Markovian regime. The figure demonstrates that increasing yu leads to a significant enhancement of quantum steerability.
Furthermore, the steerability grows over time, eventually reaching a steady state.

In Fig. 3(a), we plot the quantum steerability versus the time and scattering angle y in the non-Markovian regime. In contrast
to the Markovian case, where steerability generally decreases monotonically with time, the non-Markovian regime exhibits
periodic oscillations in steerability. Besides, quantum steerability reaches its maximum at y = 2/2. Moreover, the memory
effects inherent to the non-Markovian regime induce a non-monotonic behavior of quantum steering over time.

We plot in Fig. 3(b) the quantum steerability vs time and the classical correlation parameter ys in a non-Markovian regime.
We note that the amplitude of the quantum steerability oscillations decreases as the classical correlation parameter ju increases.
Furthermore, the decay rate of steerability becomes significantly slower as z takes higher values, supporting the idea that stronger
classical correlations contribute to a better preservation of quantum steerability.

We plot in Fig. 4(a)-(b) the steerabilities S,, and S,x, as well as the asymmetry 6S versus the time for different values of
the scattering angle y in the Markovian regime. We remark that quantum steerability can be enhanced by increasing classical
correlations (quantified by jz) in hyperon-antihyperon states. Furthermore, the steerabilities decrease quickly over time to vanish.
For instance, for 4 = 0.8 and y = 7/2, the steerabilities S,q = S,q > 0 (ie., dS = 0) when time < 0.8. This indicates the

existence of two-way steering between hyperon A and antihyperon A. However, for time > 0.8, the steerability is vanishing, i-e.,
Sya = Sax = 0. This shows that there is no-way steering between the two qubits A and A.

Figures 5(a)-(b) examine the non-Markovian regime, revealing oscillatory behavior in all quantities for lower uz, which is
attributed to memory effects. We note that the oscillations gradually lose amplitude over time. Similarly to the Markovian case,
when Sj, = S,, > 0 (ie., 6S = 0). This indicates the presence of two-way steering between qubit A and qubit A. However,
when S,q = Sx, = 0, it shows that no-way steering exists between the two qubits.

B. Entanglement of formation

The entanglement of formation, &, of a bipartite pure state is given by the von Neumann entropy of either of its subsystems,
A or A. These entropies are equal and write as

&(@) = -Tr{Ga logs Ga} = -Tr{dq logs da}, (26)

Here, 6, is the partial trace of 6,4 over subsystem A, and 6, is defined similarly.
As shown in [81], the entanglement defined in Eq. (26) can be written as

&@) = E(C@)) Q7)

with E(C(@)) given by
(28)

a/1 — C2(6
(CO) ee - - c 2)

where g(x) = —xlog, x — (1 — x) log,(1 — x). Such that C represents the concurrence. It is essential to underline that the
concurrence range varies between zero to one. The zero and nonzero values of concurrence indicate, respectively, a separable
state and an entangled state.

The concurrence of a two-qubit mixed state 6,, is defined as the minimum average concurrence over all possible pure-state
decompositions of 6, [82]

Fig. 6(a) shows the evolution of entanglement of formation & as a function of time and the scattering angle y in Markovian
regime. We observe that entanglement of formation gradually decreases over time to be stationary approximately at 6 = 0.22.
The maximum of the entanglement is achieved for the angle around y = 7/2, as depicted in Fig. 6(a). Also, the entanglement
exhibits remarkable symmetry around y = 2/2. We notice that the entanglement decreases as y deviates further from 7/2.

In Fig. 6(b), we present & as a function of time and ys in Markovian regime. It is observed that stronger classical correlations
effectively delay entanglement decay, thereby reducing decoherence. Entanglement reaches a steady state after a time threshold
(Fig. 6(b)). Steady-state entanglement grows as ju increases.

In Fig. 7(a), we observe that entanglement of formation & does not follow a monotonic decay over time. On the contrary, it
exhibits periodic oscillations. More specifically, entanglement & reaches its maximum at y = 2/2. However, memory effects
lead to a non-monotonic behavior of entanglement of formation over time.

Fig. 7(b) shows that the entanglement of formation & oscillations decreases as the classical correlation parameter jy increases.
Moreover, the decay rate becomes significantly slower for higher values of jz. This relationship highlights the delicate balance
between classical and quantum correlations, emphasizing how classical parameters can influence quantum dynamics.

C. Geometric quantum discord

The quantum discord provides a more comprehensive measure of quantum correlations in a system, taking into account
all forms of quantum correlation. It was initially introduced as an entropy-based measure that assesses the actual quantum

represented by

QGaal = MGa : 6A) — CGna), (33)

where I(6, : 6x) = Sa) + S (6x) — S@qa) represents the mutual information between subsystems A and A, while C(6,,)
denotes the classical correlation of the composite system 6,4, defined as C(6yq) = maxy,[S (Gq — Dix PeS (Ox)]. This involves
maximizing over positive operator-valued measurements (POVMs), Ax, applied exclusively to subsystem A. However, even for
a two-qubit system [84, 85], performing this analytical maximization over POVMs is a complex task. Faced with this challenge,
various alternative approaches have been developed to assess quantum correlations [86]. These methods incorporate geometric
considerations rather than relying solely on entropic calculations [87], thus providing alternative options to characterize the
quantum correlations present in quantum systems.

Geometric approaches are widely employed to assess and quantify quantum resources across various quantum systems, with
particular emphasis on the Schatten 1-norm (or trace norm) quantum discord [83]. The GQD, for a two-qubit state, can be
expressed as [88]

Dg Gna) = min|lOna ~ Gelli, (34)

The geometric quantum discord Dg is plotted in Fig. 8 (Markovian regime) and Fig. 9 (non-Markovian regime). The same
parameter domain used for quantum steering and concurrence was employed for these GQD calculations.

Figure 8 depicts the time evolution of GQD in the Markovian regime, with (a) y and (b) yz varied in separate subfigures. From
Fig. 8 (a), we see that GQD is symmetric and achieves its maximum value around 7/2. A gradual decrease in GQD is observed
over time.

In Fig. 9 (a), we show GQD in the non-Markovian regime as a function of time and the scattering angle y. It is observed
that GQD does not follow a monotonic decay over time. On the contrary, it exhibits periodic oscillations, characteristic of non-
Markovian effects. More specifically, GQD reaches a maximum at y = 2/2. However, memory effects result in a non-monotonic
behavior of GQD over time.

Figures 8(b) and 9(b) illustrate how classical correlations in the dephasing channel affect GQD evolution. Stronger classical
correlations, indicated by higher values of yz, lead to a slower decay of GQD, thus enhancing the preservation of quantum
advantages. Figure 9(b) also exhibits this trend; however, in the non-Markovian regime, significant memory effects give rise to
non-exponential decay and complex dynamics in GQD. For p close to 1, GQD is robust against decoherence in both regimes.

D. Quantum Coherence

Quantum coherence is a vital resource for various quantum information tasks. The /;-norm of coherence is both intuitive
and computable, making it a useful measure of quantum coherence [89, 90]. The quantification of coherence by this measure
relies on determining the minimal distance between the given quantum state and the set of all incoherent states. To calculate the

Fig. 10(a) shows the evolution of Cj; as a function of time and the angle y. We observe that quantum coherence gradually
decreases over time, reaching its maximum at specific angles: y = 0, y = a, and y = 2/2. These angles indicate that the align-
ment of particle spins plays a crucial role in maximizing quantum correlations. Additionally, coherence displays a remarkable
symmetry around y = 77/2.

Coherence dynamics are affected by the stronger classical correlations that arise from increasing yw. The behavior of Cy, as a
function of time and py is depicted in Fig. 10(b). We remark as time progresses, quantum coherence increases and eventually
reaches a constant value, indicating a steady state. Also, we observe a decrease in the coherence decay rate with increasing pu.
This indicates that classical correlations delay decoherence.

For the same time intervals, coherence evolution is shown in Fig. 10 (Markovian) and Fig. 11 (non-Markovian). In the
non-Markovian regime, memory effects and non-exponential decay cause oscillations in coherence.

FIG. 11: Dynamical evolution of quantum coherence Cj, in the Non-Markovian regime with t = 5 for (a) p = 0.8 and (b) y = 77/2.

In Fig. 11(a), we see that quantum coherence exhibits non-monotonic decay over time. Instead, it oscillates periodically,
indicating non-Markovian behavior. This can explaine by the memory effects. Besides, the maximum values of quantum
coherence are observed at y = 0, y = 27/2, and y = 7.

Fig. 11 (b) shows that the amplitude of the quantum coherence oscillations decreases as the classical correlation parameter, ju,
increases. Slower decay at higher jz confirms that stronger classical correlations preserve coherence.

V. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF QUANTUM RESOURCES

In this section, we discuss the influence of classical correlations on the temporal evolution of quantum resources in both the
Markovian regime (memoryless dynamics) and the non-Markovian regime (memory effects are crucial).

The observation that classical correlations enhance quantum steering, entanglement of formation, geometric quantum discord,
and quantum coherence in hyperon-antihyperon states is of paramount importance. As depicted in Fig. 12(d), when the classical
correlations reach their maximum value of j = 1, all quantum resources achieve its steady-state over time, signifying their
robustness against decoherence. When yu < 1, the quantum resources degrade quickly over time, and the rate of degradation is
inversely related to uw. This decay emphasizes the critical role that classical correlations play in maintaining quantum properties.

For yu = 0, as illustrated in Fig. 12(a), the quantum resources are initially nonzero over the interval Time € [0,0.3]. Between

Time € [0.3,4], the AA qubits retain their entanglement even though the steerability measure vanishes (S,, = 0) in Time = 0.3,
highlighting that entanglement can persist without steerability. This decoupling between the two resources is clearly visible
by comparing Fig. 2 and Fig. 6. Once entanglement disappears at Time = 4 (& = 0), GQD and quantum coherence continue
to exist and decay monotonically. Notably, even after the disappearance of entanglement of formation, GQD and quantum
coherence persist and tend toward an asymptotic regime, remaining at nearly constant values.Quantum coherence is the most
general resource, serving as an upper bound for quantum discord, entanglement of formation, and quantum steering, which
represent progressively more specific and fragile forms of correlations, as illustrated in Fig. 12(a-d).
In the non-Markovian regime, particularly for « < 1 [Fig. 13(a-c)], the presence of memory effects leads to oscillatory
behavior in quantum resources, particularly when classical correlations are diminished. This oscillatory behavior is the primary
distinction between the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. These correlations evolve in a sinusoidal and in-phase manner,
highlighting the significant influence of non-Markovian memory effects on their dynamics. The amplitude of these oscillations
decreases over time, reflecting a gradual decay of quantum resources. Notably, when classical correlations are absent (41 = 0), as
depicted in Fig. 13(a), the quantum resources degrade quickly to reach its steady-state similar to those in the Markovian regime.
When the classical correlations reach their maximum value (i.e. « = 1), all quantum resources converge to a steady state over
time, thereby illustrating their robustness against decoherence, as shown in Fig. 13(d).

The behavior of quantum resources such as steerability, entanglement of formation, GQD, and quantum coherence, remains
stable in both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. However, the dynamics of these resources differ significantly depending
on the regime. In the Markovian regime, the future states of the system are memoryless, whereas in the non-Markovian regime,
past states influence the system’s evolution. As illustrated in Fig. 13(a), the resources are initially present in the interval Time €
[0, 0.2], and steerability rapidly vanishes around Time ~ 0.2, as shown in Fig. 3, while entanglement, geometric quantum discord

(GQD), and quantum coherence maintain significant values. This result highlights the ability of certain quantum resources, such
as entanglement, discord, and coherence, to persist even in the absence of steerability. In the interval Time € [0.2, 0.7], a notable
decrease in the entanglement of formation is observed, which may even temporarily vanish. In contrast, geometric discord
and quantum coherence remain clearly non-zero. This observation emphasizes the increased robustness of these two resources,
which can survive independently of the presence of entanglement, thereby revealing a hierarchy among the different forms of
quantum correlations in a non-Markovian environment.

The hierarchy of quantum resources illustrates a structured progression of correlations, starting with quantum coherence,
which constitutes the fundamental resource underlying all others. Quantum coherence bounds the geometric quantum discord
(GQD), ensuring that GQD cannot exceed the coherence present in the system [91]. The GQD encompasses a broader range
of correlations than entanglement, which represents a specific form of bipartite correlation related to the non-separability of
states [92, 93]. This hierarchical organization implies that the emergence of each new quantum property depends on the existence
of the previous one. At the top of this hierarchy lies quantum steering, highlighting its greater sensitivity to environmental
decoherence [94]. Thus, the hierarchy can be summarized as follows:

Quantum coherence 2 Quantum discord D> Entanglement of formation > Quantum steering,

emphasizing the central role of these resources in the dynamics of quantum information and the development of advanced
quantum technologies [95].

VI. CONCLUSION

In this work, the dynamics of quantum coherence and quantum correlations in the process of e*e~ > J/w — AA at the BESIII
experiment are investigated. Quantum coherence is quantified using the 1l-norm. Quantum steering is employed to measure
the amount of steerability between the qubits, while entanglement of formation serves as an entanglement witness. Geometric
quantum discord quantifies general quantum correlations beyond entanglement. The comparison between the quantum resources
is discussed. Our results reveal that the quantum coherence and correlations are maximized at specific scattering angle ¢,
particularly at g = 7/2. We have discussed that the classical correlations can delay the decay of quantum correlations and
coherence using feasible experimental parameters. Additionally, we have discussed the impact of non-Markovian memory
effects, which play a crucial role in the stability of quantum coherence and quantum correlations. Crucially, our analysis confirms
the theoretical hierarchy of quantum resources: the set of steerable states is a subset of entangled states, which in turn is a subset
of states with non-zero geometric quantum discord. Quantum coherence further generalizes this hierarchy, as all states with
discord exhibit coherence, but not vice versa-consistent with the results depicted in Figs. 13(a) and 12(a), i.e. quantum coherence
> geometric quantum discord > entanglement of formation > quantum steerability. Our results have significant implications for
future research on hyperon-antihyperon interactions, offering deeper insights into both strong and weak interactions in particle
physics. They also pave the way for future experimental and theoretical studies on the engineering of quantum coherence and
17

correlations, with potential applications in quantum technologies.
