We investigate liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and interfacial proper-
ties of two LLPS modes: associative (ALLPS) and segregative (SLLPS). Analytical
expressions for the critical point (CP) and binodal boundaries are derived and
show excellent agreement with self-consistent field (SCF) lattice computations.

Distinct thermodynamic features differentiate ALLPS from SLLPS: (1) in
ALLPS, polymers co-concentrate within a single dense phase coexisting with a
solvent-rich phase, whereas in SLLPS each polymer forms a separate phase; (2)
the attractive interaction per monomer in ALLPS is strongly dependent on solvent
quality, but solvent-independent in SLLPS; and (3) ALLPS binodals exhibit near-
universal behavior, largely independent of solvent content.

SCF results further show that interfacial tension increases and interfacial
width decreases with distance from the CP. We provide scaling relations for both
quantities are provided. Compared with SLLPS, ALLPS displays higher interfa-
cial tension and a thinner interface, reflecting distinct molecular organization at

the liquid-liquid boundary.
1 Introduction

Liquid—liquid phase separation (LLPS) is the demixing of a homogeneous liquid into two (or more)
coexisting liquid phases. LLPS occurs in a wide range of colloidal, polymeric, and/or amphiphilic
soft matter systems (/-3). Adding a certain amount of nonadsorbing polymers to a colloidal
dispersion leads to LLPS (4-6) if the depletion attraction (7, 8) is sufficiently long-ranged (9).
Self-assembly of amphiphiles (/0) can be induced by LLPS. Macromolecular LLPS plays a central
role in structuring both synthetic (//) and biological (2, 13) soft matter systems and is used in
technological applications (/4, /5). In materials science, LLPS involving polymers offers a powerful
method to structure matter at the micro- and nanoscale (/6—/8). Through careful design of polymer
architecture and interactions, LLPS can generate the spontaneous formation of dynamic, multi-phase
materials (/0, 19, 20). Importantly, LLPS can be responsive (2/) to external stimuli (22)—such as
temperature, pH, or ionic strength, allowing the creation of adaptive, programmable materials (23).

In biology, LLPS has been recognized as a fundamental organizing mechanism in living
cells (13, 24, 25). The high concentration of biomacromolecules in cells leads to macromolecu-
lar crowding (26), which underlies the formation of membraneless organelles (MLOs) (27, 28) such
as nucleoli, stress granules, and other condensates composed of proteins, RNA, and other biopoly-
mers. Biocondensates arising from LLPS (29-31) allow cells to compartmentalize biochemical
reactions without lipid membranes, thereby enabling rapid responses to environmental cues. It is
increasingly clear that many cellular phase transitions occur close to saturation concentrations, mak-
ing them easily tunable yet vulnerable to dysregulation. The dense protein phases that arise from
LLPS can enhance protein aggregation, which can be regarded as uncontrolled self-organization.
Indeed, LLPS has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases (32, 33) such as amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s, where pathological condensates serve as precursors
to toxic protein aggregates (34).

While LLPS has attracted considerable attention in recent years, its fundamental thermodynamic
origins remain less thoroughly explored, particularly for the associative case. For long chains, binary
polymer blends typically phase separate (35-37). When different polymers are mixed in the same
solvent, LLPS occurs above a certain polymer concentration (38, 39). In a seminal paper, Dobry and

Boyer-Kawenoki (40) showed that classical synthetic polymers in a ternary polymer | + polymer
2 + solvent 3 mixture are typically incompatible. This can be explained (4/) by the fact that the
entropy of mixing polymer chains is small compared to that of mixing low molar mass substances;
however, the mixing enthalpy of most unlike monomers of polymers is positive. Hence, a slight

repulsive interaction between different polymers already leads to segregative demixing.

Phase Separation (LLPS) state diagram of two symmetric polymers | (blue) and 2 (red) with chain
lengths N in a common solvent (gray). In the segregative case (y12N/(1 — #3) = 2), one phase (say,
q) is polymer 1-rich, whereas the other phase (8) is polymer 2-rich. In the associative scenario
(12 < 4x13 — 2(1 + 1/VN)?), one phase is solvent-rich (a) and polymer-lean and both associated
polymers concentrate in the other phase (8). The phase boundaries are indicated in terms of the

(scaled) critical polymer—polymer interaction xr .

The opposite case, in which there are (effective) attractions between the different polymers,
was investigated at an early stage by Bungenberg de Jong and Kruyt (42). It was observed that
mixing two solutions containing oppositely charged macromolecules results in associative phase
separation, wherein one of the resulting phases is the coacervate phase (42-44). This phase is
a dense macromolecular “complex” composed of the oppositely charged components. The other
phase, the supernatant, is largely devoid of these macromolecular species. Complex coacervation
remains widely used to describe such phase behavior (45), and is, nowadays, for instance, used to
prepare artificial cells (46).

Although LLPS is relevant across a broad range of disciplines, a clear distinction (47-49) be-

tween its two principal driving modes is still not consistently made (Fig. 1). Segregative liquid-liquid

4
phase separation (SLLPS) is driven by repulsive interactions between dissimilar macromolecules,
while associative liquid-liquid phase separation (ALLPS) is governed by attractive interactions
between the different polymeric species. This distinction is essential for interpreting the diversity of
phase behaviors observed in both synthetic systems and living cells. For example, crowding-induced
demixing driven by excluded volume interactions in the bacterial cytoplasm (26, 30) exemplifies
SLLPS, whereas specific attractive interactions between intrinsically disordered proteins and RNA
in eukaryotic organelles (50) often underlie ALLPS.

In recent years, significant progress has been made to elucidate phase diagrams (5/—53),
enabling the efficient screening of the phase stability of mixtures of different natures. To make
progress in interpreting phase diagrams, it is crucial that the experimental toolbox is combined
with the theoretical interpretation of phase behavior.

In this paper, we reveal the differences in phase behavior and related interfacial proper-
ties between the two types of LLPS in a unified theoretical mean-field framework. We employ
Flory—Huggins theory (54, 55) and self-consistent field (SCF) computations (56) to study LLPS
of binary polymer mixtures in a common solvent, contrasting SLLPS (35) with ALLPS. For a
symmetric (same chain length) binary polymer mixture in a common (same solvency) solvent, we
explore SLLPS, ALLPS, and the stable regimes of the mixtures by varying the interaction strength
between the two polymers (Fig. 1). For this symmetric chain length and (non-selective) solvency
case, the advantage is that simple analytical expressions can be derived for the critical points. The
theoretical results presented here can be extended to asymmetric polymer mixtures and selective
solvents.

We compute phase diagrams and interfacial properties and demonstrate that these two modes
of LLPS exhibit profoundly different phase coexistences. We show that, even though different in
magnitude, the scaling relations with distance to the critical of the interfacial tension and width
is the same in both modes. Notably, we find that interfacial tension is dramatically higher in the
associative case due to the sharp interface between the coacervate and the solvent. We shed light
on the role of effective solvency Ay: the difference between polymer—polymer and polymer—solvent
interaction, on the phase stability region. Our results provide a clear distinction between associative
and segregative LLPS, offering insights that are relevant for the design of structured materials and

the understanding of intracellular phase behavior.
2 Theory

For a mixture composed of k-components AF™*, the Flory-Huggins (FH) free energy of mixing
reads (57): AF™*/LkgT = f = e (¢;/N;) Ing; + 5 = 5 Xijpbib;, With yi; = x;; the interaction
parameter between components i ‘and J. $j the volume fraction of component i, L the total number
of lattice sites, and N; the chain length of component i. Hence, for a ternary mixture of polymers
1 and polymers 2 with equal chain length N = N; = N2 ina solvent 3 (N3 = 1), the dimensionless
free energy density f per lattice site can be written as (58):

N 2 In bo + 63 In b3 + Yi2h1d2 + X1363(G1 + $2), (1)

where we assumed the solvent quality for both polymers in the solvent is the same: y13 = 723, a
situation that may be approximated, for instance, for polysaccharides mixed with PEO in water at
room temperature (59). Note that the volume filling constraint 5 ¢; = 1 is imposed. Here we do
not account for the effects of polymer polydispersity on the phase stability of polymer mixtures
in a common solvent (57, 60), we exclude poor solvency cases (6/) do not account for solvent
disparity (62). We note that we find that ALLPS follows from FH theory without evoking further
attractions between the monomers of the two different polymers (63) or by modifying the entropic
terms (64).

to induce a coacervate (a phase of the two dense polymers) coexisting with a solvent-rich phase,
whereas for a 6-solvent (13 = 1/2) a weak attraction suffices to induce demixing oe assoc < 0).
This opens up the possibility of ALLPS at relatively small, negative y12 for long polymer chains in

a (close to) 6-solvent, which can be achieved experimentally (65).

For the segregative case (35), the classical binary symmetric polymer melt result y,, =2/N
(Eq. (2a)) is recovered (38) in the absence of solvent. In the presence of solvent, the specific solvent
quality y13 (=y23) does not affect the critical point, but the solvent concentration weakens the
segregation for entropic reasons (35, 58, 62, 66, 67).

Analytic expressions for the polymer volume fractions at the CP are:

1- $3

SLLPS (3a)

Eq. (3a) reveals that the polymer segment volume fraction at the critical point is independent of chain
length for the segregative case. In contrast, Eq. (3b) indicates that for ALLPS the critical volume
fraction is independent of the amount of solvent but depends only on the polymer chain length.
This stems from the fact that the two polymers concentrate in the coacervate phase, coexisting with
a nearly pure solvent phase. It is already clear from the critical point expressions above that ALLPS

and SLLPS are fundamentally different. This is confirmed by the LLPS phase diagrams.

3 Results and Discussion

By using standard thermodynamics (see SI), we computed the chemical potentials of all components,
from which we can compute binodals as a function of y12, at fixed solvent conditions (via 713)
and solvent concentration $3. For a ternary FH mixture, such endeavors have been done before
(61, 68, 69), by using only positive Flory-Huggins parameters (SLLPS). For polymers in a binary
solvent mixture, Zhang (70, 7/) gained useful insights into the co-solvency (7/) and co-non-
solvency (70) effects observed experimentally. We focus on two-phase coexistence, while it is
recognized that three-phase coexistence may also occur occasionally for poor solvency (6/, 62).
Fig. 2 shows the phase equilibria in terms of coexisting volume fractions (binodals) for N = 200
in a 6-solvent (y13 = ¥23 = 1/2) for various interaction strengths yj2 between the different
polymers. The curves show the phase coexistences calculated from the FH free energy (Eq. (1)).
Data points are the results of numerical SCF lattice computations (56, 66, 67) that match the FH

predictions. SLLPS occurs for sufficiently positive values of 712. For SLLPS the volume fractions

where a and f are the two coexisting phases considered (see the caption of Fig. 1). Adding more
solvent narrows the partitioning of the polymers over the two phases (Fig. 2(a)) and moves the phase
coexistence concentrations to higher 712 values. The solvent compositions in (Fig. 2(b)) also follow
from (a) through the filling constraint 6; + ¢2 + ¢3 = 1. We note that the specific solvent quality
X13 (=V23) does not influence the overall shape of the SLLPS binodals (see SI). For ALLPS, the
results in Fig. 2 show that the phase diagram is independent of ¢3. If a is the polymer-rich phase,

the relations between component volume fractions for ALLPS are:

corrected for the affinity for the solvent. For a given chain length, the binodals for different solvencies
collapse onto a single curve. Fig. 3 emphasizes the fact that the effective interaction, Ay, determines
the location of the ALLPS binodals. The segregation binodals are independent of the polymer
solvency conditions, as reflected in the independence of their critical point with 713. Eq. (3a)
explains the volume fraction dependence of the CP (black dashed curves) in Fig. 2, and Eq. (3b)
gives the chain length dependence (dashed) of the CP in Fig. 3. The gray stars in Fig. 3 correspond
to the critical endpoints at N > oo.

While ALLPS involving complex coacervation is often observed in solutions with oppositely
charged polymers (45, 72-74), ALLPS is commonly not observed for uncharged polymers. Although
there are exceptions (65), in most cases, the effective interactions between neutral polymers are
repulsive, and a slight repulsion is sufficient to induce phase separation above a certain polymer
concentration.

In the field of supramolecular chemistry, modern polymer synthesis revealed, however, possi-
bilities to induce strong attractions (75, 76) between polymer segments, involving, e.g., hydrogen
bonds (77) between different monomers. For instance, we mention synthetic nucleobase-containing
polymers (78, 79) that mimic both the structures and functions of natural nucleic acids (80). High-
affinity versions of hydrogen bonding polymers have also been developed (8/). Mixtures of such
polymers can be made so that hydrogen bonds exist between them. In binary mixtures of deep
eutectic solvents (82), y12 values in the range —5 S$ 12 S$ —2 can describe the strength of hydrogen
bond interactions. Hence, it is expected that mixtures of polymers can be prepared that induce
ALLPS without opposite charges, but this has not yet been explored.

Next, we focus on the interfacial properties of the coexisting phases for ALLPS and SLLPS.
When LLPS occurs, an interface appears between the phases (83—86), with an interfacial region over
which the density profiles of the different components vary. The interfacial tension, resulting from
the inhomogeneous density profiles between coexisting phases, plays a central role in determining
the morphology and stability of the resulting phases (87). Understanding interfacial properties,
such as interfacial tension and thickness, helps in understanding, for instance, the behavior of
MLOs, liquid-like compartments within living cells that mediate a range of essential physiological
functions. In biological systems, the value of the interfacial tension governs condensate localization
via wetting, drives regulated coalescence, and supports the emergence of multiphase organization
(87, 88) Elucidating how the interactions among the constituent molecules modulate the interfacial
tension is, consequently, key in controlling and predicting the behavior of such systems.

In Fig. 4, local polymer segment and solvent volume fraction profiles in the interfacial region
are plotted as a function of the position z. Near the interface between the coexisting phases a and

B, these curves follow (86, 89):

bi(z) =

a _ 7B aw B _
og; ¢; 5. (gs +¢°) tan (5 *) , (6)

2 2 wo

with i = {1,2}, zo the position of the interface and wo, the interfacial width. The numerical SCF
lattice results were fitted to Eq. (6), giving close agreement (see SI). At fixed solvent concentrations,
the collection of profiles varies from light gray to black as the distance to the critical point increases
(see the caption for details).

In the segregative case, we plot the results for solvent volume fractions of 0.5 (a),(d) and 0.95

(b),(e). The interface is sharper when the polymer content is higher. Further from the critical

10
point, where the concentration profiles become increasingly inhomogeneous, the interfacial width
decreases.

Remarkable is the local adsorption of solvent at the interface for SLLPS (Fig. 4(d),(e)). This
positive adsorption can be explained (67) by the fact that the solvent is not repelled by either of the
polymers; however, the polymers do repel each other. Therefore, the solvent can reduce the number
of unfavorable polymer | — polymer 2 contacts by accumulating at the interface. This z-dependent
adsorption profile near the interface at z = zp can be described using a shifted normal distribution:

tea pt + 68
o3(z) = 68e 0 + SS

()

where oats quantifies the amplitude of the Gaussian function and relates to the adsorption of the
solvent. The solvent concentrations in the bulk phases @ and £ are given by ¢§ and o . It is known
that the combination of two hyperbolic functions leads to a normal distribution (90). In the SI, we
show that Eq. (7) accurately describes SCF data.

In the associative case (Fig. 4(c),(f)) the interface looks fundamentally different. The interface
is relatively sharp, also far from the critical point, even at this low polymer content (¢3 = 0.95). For
SLLPS (b,e) (¢3 = 0.95) the interfacial region, where the concentration profiles are inhomogeneous,
is relatively wide (spanning the entire range shown here), whereas it is much thinner for ALLPS
(c,f). In the associative case, one phase mainly contains solvent, while the other is dense in both
polymers. Conversely, in the segregative case, both phases contain (for the symmetric case equal
and) significant amounts of polymers that repel each other, which explains the wider interface. Note
that the observed adsorption peaks are consistently less pronounced for y13 = 0 (see SI) compared
to @-solvent conditions.

All ALLPS polymer segment concentration profiles (Fig. 4) follow Eq. (6), with ¢1(z) ~ ¢2(z):
the two polymers associating in a single solvent-lean phase, and the solvent partitioning into a
solvent-lean (polymer-rich) and a solvent-rich (polymer-lean) phase. As observed in (f), the solvent
concentration in the polymer-rich phase decreases the further away 72 is from the CP. For instance,
for the black curve, yvi2 = —3, ¢§ ~ 0.4 (the polymer-rich phase far away from the interface, see
the corresponding binodal in Fig. 2(b)).

The numerical SCF lattice computations also yield (see SI) the interfacial tension y of the

interface resulting from the LLPS. The SCF fits to Eq. (7) provide the interfacial thickness, wo.

Fig. 2 (N = 200), so for the 6-solvent condition y13 = y23 = 0.5. In panels (d-f) the solvent

X12 = {0.3, 0.296, ...,0.032, 0.028} for 63 = 0.95 (segr.), yi2 = {0.3, 0.297, ..., 0.204, 0.201} ;

case (c,f) 63 = 0.95 (assoc.), ¥12 = {-3.0, —2.9, ..., -0.3} (approaching the CP from black to light
gray). A systematic comparison of these fitted profiles with the SCF-generated profiles is provided
in the SI.

The polymer—polymer interaction (12) and the solvent concentration (#3) turn out to be the two
main tuning knobs on the LLPS landscape determining the interfacial properties. We elucidated
the dependencies of y and wo on y12 and ¢3, by making use of previously derived relations for
solvent-free binary polymer mixtures (89). Our main findings are summarized in Fig. 5. In the SI
(Fig. S5) we provide the raw SCF data.

Remarkably, the scaling behavior of both the interfacial tension (y) and the interfacial width
(wo) is independent of the nature of the LLPS type: only their magnitude (the prefactor of the

scaling relation) is affected by the nature of the phase separation. As observed already in Fig. 4,

12
the interface is sharper for ALLPS compared to SLLPS. This explains why we find a much higher
interfacial tension for ALLPS (Fig. 5(a)).

We find that the following scaling relation of the interfacial tension y:

cp\ 3/2
= (1-4) (1-43), (8)

describes the SCF computations. Eq. (8) is based on the well-known result (89, 9/) for solvent-free
polymer mixtures, y ~ (1 -— Xi. /x12)°/*. Additionally, accounting for the solvent concentration
dependence, via | — ¢3, suffices to describe y using Eq. (8). This ¢3-dependency arises because the
interfacial tension is directly related to the polymer concentration difference across the interface;
consequently, increasing the solvent content leads to a reduction in interfacial tension for both
LLPS modes. For SLLPS (orange regions), the interfacial tension appears to be independent of
the specific common polymer solvent solubility conditions 13 and of the solvent concentration 3
with varying polymer—polymer interaction y;2 when using the scaling of Eq. (8), where the critical
point plays a crucial role. For ALLPS (gray regions), there is a decrease in the interfacial tension
as 113 increases from 0 to 0.5.
For wo, we expect (89)
X12 -—X o

wo ~ \]-——— (9)
X12

and we find that this holds quite generally for a wide range of (common) solvency conditions
for two polymers, accounting for both SLLPS and ALLPS (Fig. 5(b)). There is a weak polymer
solvency dependence of the interfacial width wo for both SLLPS and ALLPS. The small values for
y correspond to large wo values.

We note that the Flory-Huggins theory used in this work, which is the basis of SCF, is crude.
The enthalpy expression used neglects correlation effects in the occupancy of lattice sites and
overestimates the number of neighbors of polymer segments in the lattice. In the FH approach, it is
assumed that the lattice sites can be occupied independently of each other. This is not correct for
chains that must be both self-avoiding and mutually avoiding, as it neglects the disparity in size and
shape of the subunits of the two types of chains in a polymer blend, along with packing constraints
and specific interactions. Even within the realm of a lattice model, the statistical mechanics involve

rough approximations beyond the mean field approximation. As a result, the FH scaling prediction

14
differs from the correct critical behavior. Flory-Huggins theory, however, appears to be qualitatively
correct in many circumstances (35). It can, therefore, be used to focus on the ‘universal’ aspects of

the phase behavior of polymer mixtures, which is exactly the purpose of this work.

4 Concluding remarks

We have shown that one can realize liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of a binary polymer
mixture in a common non-selective solvent through two rather different driving forces. Segregative
LLPS (SLLPS) occurs if there are any strong repulsive interactions between the components, i.e.,
if any of the y’s is sufficiently large, even if the other y’s are small. Associative LLPS (ALLPS)
occurs if the interactions between the components are sufficiently different, i.e., if Ay of one
(or more) of the combinations of interactions is large. This holds true for both favorable and
unfavorable interactions; it is driven by Ay. This implies that phase separation is also possible in
the case of a mixture with only favorable interactions. The latter insight also explains the findings
of Zhang (70, 7/) on the co-solvency and co-non-solvency of a polymer solution in a binary liquid
mixture using the same Flory-Huggins approach for a ternary mixture.

The ALLPS phase equilibria are quite different from those for SLLPS because, in ALLPS, both
polymers concentrate in a single phase, and the amount of solvent does not affect the equilibrium.
SLLPS binodals strongly depend on the amount of solvent, which tunes the partitioning between
the two different repulsive polymers. The observation that, unlike SLLPS, ALLPS equilibria are
independent of solvent concentration can be used to experimentally determine whether SLLPS or
ALLPS has occurred.

We showed that tie-lines do not directly provide information about interactions; rather, they
provide information about the component distributions, which, in turn, are a result of the monomer—
monomer interactions and solvent concentration.

We find that the scaling of interfacial tension and width with respect to the distance to the critical
point appears to be universal, independent of the mode of LLPS. The nature of phase coexistence
and the interface is, however, heavily dependent on the type of LLPS. The ALLPS interface is
much sharper compared to SLLPS. leading to significantly higher interfacial tensions of ALLPS

than those of SLLPS. The solvent quality tunes the interfacial properties for ALLPS; with better

15
solvent quality, the interfacial tension increases and the interface becomes sharper.

Calculation of binodals and critical points from Helmholtz energy for a

ternary mixture

Below we provide the thermodynamic Flory-Huggins (FH) theory expressions for a three-component

mixture:

where n; is the number of molecules of component 7. Following the notation of van Leuken et
al. (60) we can write down the FH free energy density f = F/LkgT expression (i.e., the free

energy per lattice unit) for such a three-component mixture as:

f= i. Ing + 2 In dz + . In $3 + Y12¢1¢2 + 136263 + 236263 , (S2)

with:

The chemical potentials for the three components follow from:

OF

where n; is the number of molecules of component i in the system. Implicitly, symmetric contact

interactions between different species have been considered, whereas the self-interactions are

regarded as athermal (only excluded volume interactions):
Xij = Xji Xi = 0

S2
When taking the derivatives of F with respect to n; to find 4;, we found that the most convenient

approach is to use Eq. (S1). For a ternary mixture, the chemical potentials read:

Hi

x j 1

j#i |! j#k
where ,i;* is the reference chemical potential. With adequate boundary conditions, binodals can
now be computed using the phase coexistence conditions that the chemical potentials for all three
components are equal in both phases.

SLLPS calculations were carried out by fixing the total concentration (c) of the solvent, c =

b3 + oe (35, 68, 69, 92). Thus, we have a nonlinear system of 6 equations and 6 unknowns:

f= fb, Sof =1, Do =1, 68 +05 =e. ($5)
i=3 i=3

which is solved using the “FindRoot[]’” option in Wolfram Mathematica (93).
In the segregative case, a simplified free energy expression can be derived using ¢1+¢2+¢3 = 1,
denoting ¢; = ¢:
oe (1- ¢- $3) In(l - $- $3)
N N

The expression above recovers the well-established (94) 2-component FH expression for a symmet-

for vanishing solvent concentrations, it reflects the full concentration asymmetry of components 1

For ALLPS, binodals were calculated directly using the well-known common tangent construc-
tion from the derived free energy expressions. In a subsequent follow-up paper, we also intend to
present and discuss common tangent plots in detail.

In the associative case, we assume ¢) = ¢2 = ¢ in each phase (hence, $3 = 1 — 2), leading to:

Since there is only one relevant variable in this specific case for both the segregation and associative
scenario (one of the polymers’ volume fractions, ¢), the critical point (¢*", y“"") can be realized

by simply looking at the conditions where:

Using the corresponding free energy expressions, we obtain the expressions presented in the
main text for the critical points. All phase equilibria calculations were conducted using Wolfram

Mathematica. The scripts used to generate the data are available upon request.

Numerical Self-Consistent Field Lattice Computations

Self-consistent field (SCF) computations were employed to compute the thermodynamic properties
of solutions containing a ternary mixture of polymer | + polymer 2 and solvent 3 (62). Here, we
outline the implementation used in this work, which is based on the numerical lattice SCF theory
approximation developed by Scheutjens and Fleer (56, 95-97).

In the Scheutjens—Fleer self-consistent field (SF—SCF) method, space is discretized into a lattice
with coordination number Z. The lattice is composed of a set of lattice sites, with each molecular
segment occupying a single site.

For the systems considered here, a single concentration gradient suffices, as the relevant vari-
ations occur only along the direction normal to a liquid-liquid interface. To study liquid-liquid
phase separation, we adopt a flat geometry. The z-coordinate indexes lattice layers, numbered
z=0,1,2,...,Z, with reflecting (mirror) boundaries imposed at z = 0 and z = L + 1. The system
size L is chosen sufficiently large to ensure that bulk concentrations are reached at both boundaries.

In SCF theory, the Helmholtz energy F is expressed as a functional of the volume fractions

$i (z) of each component i and their corresponding local potentials u;(z) (56):

er = mele) - DD Epes

=a be 2 a(z) » $i(2) - ) (89)

where a(z) is a Lagrange multiplier enforcing local incompressibility, >); #;(z) = 1. The index i

labels the different components in the system, which here include solvent molecules and two types

S4
of polymer chains. Polymers are modeled as linear chains, with each segment occupying one lattice
site of size b.
The first term in Eq. (S9) is the partition function Q(u,V,T). To evaluate it, the molecular

architecture must be specified. The total partition function factorizes into single-chain contributions:

o-|] 2 “, (S10)

where q; is the single-molecule partition function for species 7. The freely jointed chain model is
employed, which enables the use of an efficient propagator formalism (95). The SCF computations
employ the Edwards formalism, where the spatially inhomogeneous equilibrium structures formed
by polymer liquids are elucidated by solving the Edwards diffusion equation for polymer chain
statistics in position-dependent potential fields.

For a molecule i composed of N; segments labeled s = 1,..., Nj, with 5, = 1 if segment s is

of type i (and zero otherwise), the potential energy of a specific conformation c is

iat = 2215 uj(r6) (S11)

where r;. is the position of segment s in conformation c. The single-chain partition function is then

qi = exp (-uf). (S12)

¢

Direct evaluation is intractable, as the number of conformations scales as Z’—!. The propagator
formalism circumvents this by reducing the computational cost to scale linearly with N;, while
simultaneously yielding segment-level volume fraction profiles ¢;(r, s). Summing over all segments
of type i gives ¢;(r) = ¢;[u].

The second term in Eq. (S9) is a Legendre transformation, converting the system of interest
to the (N,V,7) ensemble. The third term, F int contains all inter-segment interactions. Nearest-
neighbor interactions are accounted for within the Bragg—Williams mean-field approximation (94,
98), parameterized by Flory—Huggins interaction parameters y;;.

Minimization of F with respect to ¢;(z) yields

int

— 1
BoD’ eae)

uj(z) = @(z) +

SS
which, together with the propagator formalism, is solved self-consistently. In the mean-field ap-
proximation, interactions within a layer are spatially averaged. For example, (¢;(z)) is the nearest-

neighbor average of the volume fraction of component i:

(Gi(z)) = Aigi(z — D) + Aogi(z) + Aigi(z + D, (S14)

with Ap/2 = a; = 1/Z for a planar lattice. In this work, we took 2; = 1/3. For more details on
SCF, see Fleer et al. (56).

The grand potential is obtained from the Helmholtz energy by subtracting the chemical work:
Q=F-)" pin, (S15)
i

where jy; is the chemical potential of species i in the bulk (composition ¢°). From Q, the interfacial
tension y between coexisting phases follows directly (62, 99) from Q in a normalized manner as
yb? /kpT.

In all SCF results shown, the number of lattice sites used is L = 400. The initial polymer
concentration distributions differ in the segregative and associative scenarios. For the segregative
case, polymers of types (1) and (2) are initially pinned near the mirrors of the lattice (z = 0 and
z = L). For association, both polymers were initially pinned near the upper boundary of the lattice,
z = L. The iterative solution provided by SFbox achieves self-consistency between the monomer
density profiles and the effective potential fields (/00). Example SFbox input files are available
upon request.

The SCF results are compared to the Flory-Huggins theory predictions. The component con-
centrations, far away from the interfaces formed on the lattice, are compared with the theoretical
FH binodals.

SCF allows for the calculation of interfacial properties from the equilibrium grand potential
values, providing a thermodynamically consistent framework for analyzing phase separation and
interfacial phenomena in multicomponent polymer systems (66, 99).

All data generated from SFbox were analyzed using Wolfram Mathematica. Scripts for Data

Analysis are available upon request.

Phase diagrams for y;3 = 0

In the main text, we focused on the 6-solvent case 713 = 0.5, as it is theoretically an interesting
condition, but it is also close to the experimental conditions of soluble polymers (often in the range

0.3 S yv13 S 0.6). Another useful theoretical limit is the athermal, good solvent condition 713 = 0.

Fig. S2 shows a collection of SCF concentration profiles for the three components in the system,
as computed using Scheutjens-Fleer SCF with the SFbox software. Fitting curves are nearly imper-
ceptible as they overlap with SF-SCF data points. The 12-values considered are the same as those
