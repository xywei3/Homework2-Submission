ABSTRACT

We present analysis of JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of the galaxy SXDF-NB1006-2 at z = 7.212, as part of
the Reionization and the ISM/Stellar Origins with JWST and ALMA (RIOJA) project. We derive the physical properties by
conducting spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, revealing that our target is a young (age ~ 2 Myr) starburst galaxy with
intense radiation field. We detect multiple nebular emission lines from NIRSpec IFS data. We identify a robust broad component
of [O 11]A5008 emission, indicating the presence of ionized gas outflows. The derived gas depletion time of a few hundred Myr
implies that our target could be one of the progenitors of massive quiescent galaxies at z ~ 4 — 5 identified by recent JWST
observations. The spatial distribution of optical and far-infrared (FIR) [O m1] emission lines differs in morphology, likely resulting
from different critical densities and inhomogeneous density distributions within the galaxy. Potential old stellar populations may
be necessary to account for the derived metallicity of ~ 0.2 Zo, and their presence can be confirmed by future MIRI observations.
Including our target, star-forming galaxies at z > 6 detected by ALMA are generally very young but more massive and brighter
in UV than galaxies identified by only JWST. The ALMA-detected galaxies may also have a steeper mass-metallicity relation.
These findings suggest that the ALMA-detected galaxies may have experienced more efficient mass assembly processes in their

evolutionary pathways.

reionization, galaxy formation and evolution. The improvement of
observational instruments has pushed the frontiers of extragalactic
studies to more distant Universe and more detailed structures within
galaxies. Ground-based telescopes such as Subaru Telescope and
Keck Telescope are equipped with near-infrared (NIR) instruments
to observe rest-frame UV and optical light from distant galaxies.

However, their sensitivities are affected by atmospheric absorption
and their resolutions are limited by atmospheric seeing if not set
up with Adaptive Optics. As the most powerful space telescope to
date, James Webb Space Telescope (JWST; Gardner et al. 2023)
has advanced NIR and mid-infrared (MIR) capabilities with better
sensitivity, resolution and wavelength coverage compared to previous
infrared space telescopes such as Spitzer and NIR devices onboard
Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It has enabled the investigation of
the first galaxies in the Universe (e.g., Robertson et al. 2023; Donnan
et al. 2023; Harikane et al. 2023; Curtis-Lake et al. 2023; Wang et al.
2023; Hainline et al. 2024; Carniani et al. 2024b; Heintz et al. 2024;
Zavala et al. 2025; Robertson et al. 2024). Recent JWST observations
also have revealed star-forming galaxies in the early Universe with
extremely young stellar ages (e.g., Heintz et al. 2023b; Tang et al.
2023; Chen et al. 2023; Endsley et al. 2023; Looser et al. 2023;
Robertson et al. 2023; Sugahara et al. 2025), ionized gas outflows
(e.g., Tang et al. 2023; Carniani et al. 2024c), increasing galaxy
merger rates with redshift up to z ~ 6 (Duan et al. 2024), increasing
electron densities in ISM with redshift (Isobe et al. 2023; Abdurro’uf
et al. 2024; Zavala et al. 2025) and mildly evolved mass-metallicity
relation at z > 3 (e.g., Nakajima et al. 2023; Curti et al. 2024; Venturi
et al. 2024).

Additionally, radio interferometer arrays such as the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Northern
Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) provide observational win-
dows in radio wavelengths, enabling the studies of far-infrared (FIR)
emission lines (e.g., [O m1], [Cm], [N u]) and dust continuum from
galaxies in the reionization epoch (e.g., Inoue et al. 2016; Carniani
et al. 2017; Smit et al. 2018; Hashimoto et al. 2018, 2019; Tamura
et al. 2019; Bakx et al. 2020; Harikane et al. 2020; Carniani et al.
2020; Sugahara et al. 2021; Fudamoto et al. 2021; Bouwens et al.
2022; Zavala et al. 2024; Fudamoto et al. 2024; Carniani et al. 2024a;
Schouws et al. 2025; Ishii et al. 2024). Early galaxies identified by ra-
dio telescopes are unique targets for JWST follow-up studies. Inoue
et al. (2016); Harikane et al. (2020) found ALMA-detected [O m1]
emitters at z > 6 exhibit higher [O 11]/[C 11] luminosity ratios, sug-
gesting that z > 6 galaxies may have different ISM conditions and
properties compared to local sources. Furthermore, Harikane et al.
(2020) reported that z > 6 galaxies may have a steeper slope of the
[C 11]-star formation rate (SFR) correlation compared to local dwarf
galaxies, while Carniani et al. (2020) and Schaerer et al. (2020) found
no or little evolution of the [C m]-SFR relation across the cosmic time.
With high sensitivities, JWST spectroscopic observations can pro-
vide complementary information about line and continuum emission,
gas distribution and kinematics from rest-UV to NIR ranges of faint
high-z galaxies. Thus, ALMA and JWST joint analysis is critical for
understanding the physical properties of ISM and how they evolve
across the cosmic time.

The research target of this work, SXDF-NB1006-2 at z = 7.212,
was the most distant galaxy known in 2012. Subaru/Suprime-
Cam NB1006 narrow band imaging and Keck/DEIMOS spec-
troscopy first identified its Lya emission line (Shibuya et al. 2012).
Subaru/Suprime-Cam z’ band, UKIRT/WFCAM J, H, K bands, and
Spitzer 3.6 um and 4.5 zm bands also observed the rest-UV and
optical emission in this galaxy. However, except for J band, only
non-detections were obtained (Inoue et al. 2016). They performed
SED fitting based on these photometries and identified SXDF as a
young starburst galaxy with extremely short star formation timescale
of 1 — 2 Myr, high SFR of log(SFR/Mo yr7!) = 254°", stel-

lar mass of log(M,/Mo) = 8.549%, little dust attenuation of

E(B-—V) = 0-—0.04 mag, possible low metallicity of 0.05 — 1 Zo
and ionizing photon escape fraction of 0—71 per cent. Consequently,

MNRAS 000, 1-20 (2025)

it may be one of the typical star-forming galaxies (SFGs) that con-
tribute to the cosmic reionization. Nevertheless, these values were
estimated using many non-detections and suffer from large uncer-
tainties. JWST photometries with high sensitivities are capable of
deriving these physical properties more precisely.

Moreover, SXDF-NB1006-2 was the first galaxy from which
the [Om] 88 zm emission was detected with ALMA (Inoue et al.
2016). Carniani et al. (2020) found a tentative detection of
[C 11] 158 zm emission from this galaxy by analyzing archival ALMA
data. Ren et al. (2023) analyzed follow-up ALMA observations tar-
geting [O11] 88 zm with high angular resolution and identified a
clumpy structure of the [O 1] 88 zm emission. The dust continuum
in ALMA band 6 and 8 was reported as a non-detection in the above
literature. Being equipped with high spatial resolution, JWST imag-
ing and integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy are able to unveil the
morphology of emission from rest-UV to NIR wavelengths with un-
precedented details. It is time to reveal the nature of this interesting
target in the epoch of reionization.

This paper is organized as follows. The observations of our target,
data reduction and NIRCam photometries are described in Section
2. The analysis of SED fitting is shown in Section 3. The analysis of
emission lines obtained from NIRSpec data is presented in Section
4. The discussion is presented in Section 5. The conclusion is given
in Section 6. In this paper, we assume Hp = 70 km s~! Mpe7!, Quy
= 0.3 and Q, = 0.7. In this case, 1 corresponds to 5.134 kpc at
Zz = 7.212. Vacuum wavelengths are shown for emission lines. This
paper adopts the initial mass function (IMF) from Kroupa (2001).

2 DATA
2.1 Observation and Reduction

The NIRCam and NIRSpec observations were carried out as part of
the Reionization and the ISM/Stellar Origins with JWST and ALMA
(RIOJA) project (IWST GO1 PID 1840; Pls: J. Alvarez-Marquez and
T. Hashimoto; Hashimoto et al. 2023; Sugahara et al. 2025).

The NIRCam observations were conducted on August 16, 2022,
covering | — 5 um in observed frame. The effective exposure time
for NIRCam filters are 816 seconds (F115W and F277W), 2104 sec-
onds (F150W and F444W) and 730 seconds (F200W and F356W).
NIRCam imaging data were calibrated using a custom strategy based
on the JWST calibration pipeline version 1.12.3 (Bushouse et al.
2023a) and CRDS context 1145. The calibration included snowballs
and wisps removal adopting the strategy described in Bagley et al.
(2023) and further background homogenization applying the same
strategy as in Pérez-Gonzdlez et al. (2023). All images were resam-
pled to a common pixel scale of 0¢’03/pixel.

The NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy (IFS) observations were
conducted on July 24, 2023. The data were taken with a four-
point MEDIUM cycling dither pattern and the grating/filter pair
of G395M/F290LP, covering 2.87-5.27 zm in the observed frame
with the medium spectral resolution (R ~ 1000). Neither leakcal nor
off-scene background observations were conducted as our project
targets emission lines of galaxies. The effective exposure time was
1284 seconds. The data reduction was based on the JWST public
pipeline version 1.11.4 (Bushouse et al. 2023b) under CRDS context
jwst_1118.pmap. We applied additional reduction processes, includ-
ing (1) the 1/f-noise removal, (2) the rejection of hot pixels and
cosmic-ray effects by sigma clipping, (3) the mask of pixels recording
the flux leakage from the failed open MSA shutter, and (4) the global
background subtraction by moving average as a function of wave-
lengths. The final output cube was constructed with drizzle weighting

wavelengths of [O 11]A24960, 5008, HB, Hy, He, [Ne m1]A3870 and

and 773, respectively, taken from the dispersion and resolution fits

We utilized 3 ALMA datasets to make continuum map of band
6 (rest- 160 ym; 2012.1.00374.S, 2013.A.00021.S, 2019.1.01634.L),
2 datasets to make continuum map of band 8 (rest-90 um;
2013.1.01010.S, 2015.A.00018.S) and | dataset to make continuum
map of band 9 (rest-50 zm; 2021.1.01323.S). The data reduction and
imaging were conducted by a standard way described in Ren et al.
(2023) and Ren et al. in preparation.

2.2 Correction for Astrometry

We corrected the astrometry of NIRCam images using stars from
Gaia DR3 catalog in the observed field of view (FoV) (Gaia Col-
laboration et al. 2016, 2023; Babusiaux et al. 2023). There are two
Gaia stars in total. We performed 2D Gaussian fitting using Photutils
(Bradley et al. 2022) to measure their centroids in NIRCam images,
and compared the measured centroids with their coordinates recorded
in Gaia Archive. The proper motions of Gaia stars were corrected.
The offsets between the measured centroids and the archived coor-
dinates differ across filters. Concretely speaking, the offsets of Right
Ascension (RA) and Declination (Dec) in short wavelength (SW) im-
ages are 0/03 —0/'04 and 006-008, respectively. While the offsets
of RA and Dec in long wavelength (LW) images are 0‘’002 — 0/01
and 0/03 — 0”'04, respectively. Thus, we independently corrected
the astrometry for each band’s image by applying the measured av-
erage offset of RA and Dec. However, in F150W’s image, a bad
pixel obscured the peak position of a Gaia star, preventing accurate
centroid measurement. Therefore, we aligned the F150W astrometry
by matching the centroids of other two compact sources between
F150W and astrometry-corrected F200W images. The NIRCam im-
ages of the target galaxy after correcting for the astrometry are shown
in Fig. 1.

We corrected the astrometry of NIRSpec IFU data by aligning
the centroid of [O 11]24960, 5008 emission with the centroid of
astrometry-corrected F444W image, because the emission in F444W
is predominantly contributed by [O m].

2.3 Aperture Photometry of NIRCam data

From Figure 1, the UV continuum detected in F115W, F1I50W, and
F200W is elongated toward the southwest direction, and it shows a
tail-like structure. The emission in LW images looks more extended,
which may result from lower resolutions in LW images. The emis-
sion in F444W is also more luminous and extended than the optical
continuum in F277W and F356W, due to the strong emission from
optical [O m] doublet lines.

We performed aperture photometry to measure the flux density
of our target in each filter using Photutils (Bradley et al. 2022). Be-
cause of the extended structure of the emission in each filter, we
performed curve of growth analysis to measure the total flux den-
sity. We determined the largest radius of the circular aperture to
measure the total flux density at the point where its growth curve ap-
proximately levels off. This approach allows us to measure the total
flux experimentally, thus no further aperture correction was applied.
The determined aperture sizes are shown in Table 1. The aperture

size varies across different filters due to the differing spatial scales
of emission observed in each filter. To determine photometric un-
certainties, we performed random aperture photometry, considering
possible spatial correlations of noise between pixels. We masked our
target and bright noisy pixels in this process. For each filter, the aper-
ture size of random apertures is the same as that to measure the total
flux density. Our measurements are listed in Table 1.

3 SED FITTING
3.1 Data Input

We performed SED fitting using the Bayesian Analysis of Galaxies
for Physical Inference and Parameter EStimation (BAGPIPES) code
(Carnall et al. 2018). We input the JWST NIRCam photometric re-
sults, the ALMA dust continuum non-detections at bands 6, 8, and
9 measured in Ren et al. (2023) and Ren et al. in preparation, flux
of [O m1] 88 zm emission (Ren et al. 2023) and flux of optical [O m1]
doublet measured in §4. We did not input flux of tentatively detected
[C m] 158 wm emission because BAGPIPES only considers nebular
emission from Hu regions. We made pseudo narrow band filters
to input line fluxes in BAGPIPES. For [O 1144960, 5008, we in-
put their total fluxes, including the broad component of [O 111]A5008
(§4.2). For [O m1] 88 zm, we input flux measured from 5.9 a detec-
tion (Ren et al. 2023). Since the resolution for photometric output in
BAGPIPES is R = 200 (Carnall et al. 2018), the wavelength widths
of pseudo band transmission curves for optical and FIR [O m1] are set
to be 10° and 10° A, respectively, to ensure that the input lines can be
resolved by the spectral resolution. Therefore, the input flux densities
are calculated over the widths of pseudo band transmission curves,
instead of their real line widths. The input values are 4.2 + 0.2 wy
and 0.14 + 0.04 mJy, for optical and FIR [O m1], respectively.

We set a 10 per cent error floor for NIRCam photometries with
detections > 10a, to account for possible systematic errors. How-
ever, we do not set a 10 per cent error floor for input flux density of
optical [Om], because this value is one order of magnitude higher
than those of NIRCam photometries, and a 10 per cent error will
introduce too large uncertainty. To input information of dust contin-
uum non-detections, we set the input fluxes to be 0, and the input
flux uncertainties to be their 3 0 upper limits.

According to the photometric curve of growth, the half-light scale
of UV continuum in F115W, F150W and F200W is 0/18 x 0/18.
Previously, we used | beam area to calculate the 30 upper limits
of the flux densities of undetected dust continuum (Ren et al. 2023).
If we assume the dust continuum has the same extent as the UV

continuum, the angular resolutions of ALMA band 6 (1’’2 x 0°77)
and band 8 (0/17 x 0°15) observations are low enough to detect all
the potential flux of the dust continuum (Ren et al. 2023). However,
ALMA band 9 observation has a resolution of 0’15 x 0/12 (Ren et
al. in preparation), which is likely to cause flux loss if we measure
the flux of dust continuum in band 9 under this resolution. Therefore,
we performed uy-taper with 0’’07 when making continuum map of
ALMA band 9 to scale down its resolution to the half-light scale
of UV continuum. The obtained resolution is 0/’18 x 0/14, and
the measured 30 upper limit of flux density is < 0.24mJy. This
beam area is large enough to cover the total flux of the potential
dust continuum, and we adopted the upper limit after uy-taper in
SED fitting. The information of ALMA measurements input in SED
fitting is summarized in Table 2.

MNRAS 000, 1-20 (2025)

3.2 Parameter Setting

In this fitting, we adopted stellar population models from Bruzual
& Charlot (2003), dust emission models from Draine & Li (2007),
IGM attenuation model from Inoue et al. (2014), dust attenuation law
from Calzetti et al. (2000) and Cloudy photoionization code (Ferland
etal. 2017) assembled in BAGPIPES. The original fitting range of the
ionization parameter in BAGPIPES is from —4 to —2. We updated its
upper limit to 0 with version 22.02 of Cloudy. We set the maximum
age of birth clouds to be 0.01 Gyr and the multiplicative factor 7 on
dust attenuation for stars in birth clouds to be 1. Furthermore, for
simplicity, the escape fraction of ionizing photons is assumed to be
zero in BAGPIPES. This is different from the previous SED fitting
method of the same target in Inoue et al. (2016), in which the escape
fraction of ionizing photons was a free parameter.

We tried five parametric star formation history (SFH) models
(constant, tT (exponential decline), delayed t, lognormal and dou-
ble power-law) and one non-parametric SFH model from Leja et al.
(2019) with a continuity prior in the SED fitting. For non-parametric
SFH model, the value of the oldest age bin influences both the time
when SF starts and the stellar mass. Therefore, we adopted an age
boundary of 20 Myr, which is slightly larger than, but still close to
the SF start points derived from lognormal and double power law
models. Notably, this start point is different from the SF onset time,
where the latter is defined as the time when the SFR exceeds 0.1 per
cent of the peak SFR.

3.3 SED Fitting Results

We derived best-fit results of physical quantities and their 1 7 un-
certainties from the posterior probability distribution of the output
samples from SED fitting. We present the best-fit results from six
SFH models in Table 3 and their best-fit SFHs are supplemented in
Fig. Al. Aside from non-parametric model yielding an instantaneous
SFR > 2x higher than other models, the best-fit results of SFR, Mx,
Z, Ay and log U derived from six SFH models are generally con-
sistent with each other. The mass-weighted mean stellar ages across
all six SFH models remain similar at ~ 1 — 2 Myr as well. However,
the ages since onset of SF differ: constant, t and delayed t models
resulted in comparable ages of ~ 2 Myr, whereas double power law,
lognormal and non-parametric models yielded ages 4-5 times larger,
as these models incorporate clear rising SF components. There is
also a discrepancy between observed and modeled flux in F356W
from tT, delayed 7, constant and non-parametric models, while this
discrepancy is not present within uncertainties in double power law
and lognormal fits. Thus, we adopted the best-fit results from lognor-
mal SFH model as fiducial values, and we show its SED plot in Fig.
2. The generated SED in FIR range is consistent with the 3 0 upper
limits of dust continuum non-detections.

According to the best-fit results, this galaxy has a low dust attenu-
ation, which is constrained by the non-detections of dust continuum.
It also has a short star-forming timescale and a high SFR. The spec-
trum analysis in §4 will show there is no evidence of AGN activity
in this galaxy. The SFR, even the smaller one measured from HB
emission (log(SFR/Mo yr~!) ~ 1.62; §4.4), is higher than the SFR
of log(SFR/Mg yr~!) = 0.8 + 0.4 for star formation main sequence
at z = 7— 10 at the stellar mass of our target (~ 1088 Mo) (Heintz
et al. 2023a), confirming that our galaxy is a young starburst. The
high ionization parameter of log U ~ —1.6 also implies that the ra-
diation sources in this galaxy are dominated by massive young stars
which emit strong ionizing photons. These results are consistent with
the blue UV color. We derived the UV slope by fitting the UV con-
tinuum inferred from the posterior distribution of SED fitting with
a power law f, « A® and adopting fitting windows from Calzetti
et al. (1994). The obtained 6 is —2.32 + 0.04, consistent with z = 6
galaxies detected by JWST (Endsley et al. 2023; Cullen et al. 2023;
Topping et al. 2024; Cullen et al. 2024). However, our galaxy is
brighter in rest-UV than these JWST samples (Muy = —22; see
§5.5), and the UV slope of our galaxy is bluer than the extrapolation
at Myy = —22 for UV-fainter sources at similar redshifts (median
B ~ —2.0; Topping et al. 2024).

Furthermore, the modeled spectrum from SED fitting exhibits a
prominent Balmer jump at rest-frame 3646 A (Fig. 2). Although there
is no such feature appealing in the NIRSpec spectrum because it is
too close to the lowest detectable wavelength of the adopted NIRSpec
filter and the continuum is not detected (§4), the predicted Balmer
jump suggests the presence of strong nebular continuum and the
radiation sources are dominated by young stellar populations. SED
fitting results from recent JWST/NIRCam photometries have also
revealed predictions of Balmer jumps and nebular continuum from
galaxies at very high redshifts (Topping et al. 2024; Endsley et al.
2024; Sugahara et al. 2025). There have also been JWST/NIRSpec
observations of LAEs at z ~ 6 showing Balmer jumps and nebular
continuum, and these systems are likely powered by young stellar
populations such as Wolf-Rayet stars and metal-poor massive stars
(Roberts-Borsani et al. 2024; Cameron et al. 2024). We quantified the
Balmer jump strength by measuring the flux ratio between F277W
and F356W filters, while excluding the contamination from emission
lines detected in NIRSpec data (§4). The result is 1.58 +0.14, similar

to the prediction from a two-photon emission model that successfully
explained a UV turnover feature observed at z ~ 6 (Cameron et al.
2024). Such strong two-photon emission is likely powered by very
hot stars with effective temperatures of ~ 10°K (Cameron et al.
2024). With the current data, we cannot confirm if there is strong
two-photon emission in our target, but future observations will be
crucial to examine the presence of strong two-photon emission and
very hot stars.

4 LINE MEASUREMENTS

On the top panel of Fig. 3, we show the full 1D spectrum extracted
from a circular aperture with a radius of 0’5 and centered at the
peak position of [O 11]45008 in NIRSpec IFS data. Though no sig-
nificant continuum emission is detected above the noise level, the
positive signals are continuously distributed across the spectrum.
We therefore fitted the spectrum using a 1D polynomial model while
masking out all potential emission line regions. The fitted model was
then subtracted from the original spectrum to enable accurate mea-
surements of line fluxes. After that, we conducted curve of growth
analysis on the continuum-subtracted spectrum to identify detected
emission lines and measure their total fluxes. Similar to NIRCam flux
measurements, the curve of growth analysis allows us to measure the
total flux experimentally, and no further aperture correction was ap-
plied. We detected [O 1]AA3727, 3730 with r = 014, [Ne m1]A3870,
He 1 23966+[Ne 111]13969+He blended lines and Hy with r = 03,
H6 with r = 0”’5, [Om1]24960 with r = 0/55 and [O 11JA5008 with
r = 08. The moment 0 maps of these lines are shown in Fig. 4. The
center of the apertures is the peak position of [O 111]45008 emission.
The aperture radius to measure the total flux, the measured line flux,
S/N and FWHM of each line are summarized in Table 4. We found
no evidence of AGN activity because there is no clear detection of
broad components of Balmer lines.

4.1 Measuring Line Fluxes and FWHMs

To measure line fluxes, we integrated line profiles over spectral widths
determined through visual inspection, summing the area under spec-
tral profiles within the defined line regions. The integrated regions
are wide enough because the edge bins are below or around | a level
of adjacent noise, as shown by the grey shaded regions in bottom
panels of Fig. 3. To measure the uncertainty, we generated random
apertures that do not overlap each other around the source and ex-
tracted spectra from them. We then calculated the standard deviation
of the area under the random aperture spectra over the same spec-
tral ranges when calculating flux. Notably, the line fluxes derived
from line integrations and single Gaussian fittings are all compatible
within | o, except for [O 11]45008 that exhibits broader wings in the
line profile. We will discuss this broad component in the following
section.

We measured the apparent FWHM of each line by performing
single Gaussian fitting. We then measured the intrinsic FWHM by
deconvolving the apparent FWHM with the instrumental spectral
resolution at the corresponding wavelength. The intrinsic FWHMs
of optical lines are listed in Table 4. They are consistent with the
FWHM of [O m1] 88 pm emission (152.9 + 9.0kms~!) measured in
Ren et al. (2023) within 1 -2c.

4.2 Broad Component of [O 11]2.24960, 5008

As shown in Table 4, the flux ratio of [O m1] doublet is much larger
than the theoretical value of 2.98 (Storey & Zeippen 2000). Fur-
thermore, as can be seen from the bottom panel of Fig. 3, the
[O 11]45008 line profile shows a broader component compared to the
single Gaussian profile. Therefore, we performed double Gaussian
fitting on [O11]A5008 to measure the broad component. We also
conducted residual analysis to examine its reliability. Specifically,
we subtracted the single or double Gaussian fitting curves from the
continuum-subtracted spectrum and then compared the significance
of residuals. In the double Gaussian fitting in this section, we set the
central wavelengths of the narrow and broad components to be the
same. The measurements of narrow and broad [O 11]25008 are listed

MNRAS 000, 1-20 (2025)

in Table 4. The s
Gaussian fittings

ectral residual after subtracting single and double
is shown in Fig. 5. The S/Ns of narrow and broad

components of [O 111]A5008 are > 3 o, and the spectral residual after

subtracting doub

e Gaussian fitting is much smaller than that after

single Gaussian fitting; thus, the detection of the broad [O 1145008
component is robust. The intrinsic FWHM of broad [O 1145008 is

629 + 162kms7!

, indicating the existence of ionized gas outflows.

We will discuss the outflows in detail in §5.1.

Since the [O m1

AA4960, 5008 lines should originate from the same

regions and have similar properties, the [O 1124960 line should also
have a broad component. Therefore, we performed double Gaussian
fitting and residual analysis on [O 111]4960 as well. Consequently, al-

though the broad

O111]A4960 component is too weak to claim its de-

tection, the flux ratio of narrow [O 11]25008 and narrow [O 11]A4960

(~ 3.1) is consistent with the theoretical ratio of ~ 3. Deeper inte-
grations would be required to establish the presence of the broad line
component in [O 11]4960.

4.3 Measure Metallicity From Spectral Lines

We employed strong-line method to estimate metallicity using
the following diagnostics: R3 ((O m1]A5008/HB), R2 ([O 1]4A3727,
3730/HB), R23 (([Om]Ad3727, 3730 + [Om]Ad4960, 5008)/HB)
and 0302 ([O m1]45008/[O 143727, 3730) adopted in Curti et al.
(2020).

These diagnostics are based on line ratios corrected for dust ex-
tinction using the Milky Way extinction law from Cardelli et al.
(1989). For our target, we determined the dust attenuation through
SED fitting, and the derived value is Ay = 0.21 +0.06 mag (Table 3).
Although we adopted Calzetti et al. (2000) starburst reddening curve
in the SED fitting, the differences between various dust attenuation
curves in rest-optical range are minimal (e.g., Battisti et al. 2022).
Therefore, we applied Calzetti et al. (2000) law to correct for dust
extinction of emission lines. Though Calzetti et al. (2000) suggests
E(B —V)stettar = 0.44 E(B — V)nebular, considering that we adopted
a multiplicative factor of one in the SED fitting and the stellar age

MNRAS 000, 1-20 (2025)

of our target is very young (§3), no additional correction for nebular
reddening was applied to the emission lines.

The marginally detected Hy emission enables us to measure dust
attenuation through Balmer decrement. Since Hy is detected with
slightly smaller aperture size compared to most of other lines, the
dust attenuation inferred from Hy/Hf ratio constrains the physical
conditions of more central area of the galaxy. The observed Hy/HB
ratio is 0.459 + 0.122, when the Hf flux is measured from the same
aperture size as Hy. Adopting an intrinsic Hy/H£ ratio of 0.468
for case B recombination at T, = 10,000K and ne = 100cm~?
(Osterbrock & Ferland 2006), the derived dust attenuation is Ay ~
0.16, consistent with the values obtained from SED fittings well.
When considering a range of T, from 5,000 to 20,000 K, the measured
ratio is compatible with no extinction (5,000 K) to Ay ~ 0.28 (20,000
K). The measured line ratio also has large uncertainties. Therefore, we
adopted Ay obtained from SED fitting for dust extinction correction
throughout this paper.

The values of log R3, log R23 and log 0302 calculated with the
total flux of [O 11]A5008 exceed the maximum values of the model
fits for calibration of the diagnostics. To address the saturation of R3
and R23, we determined the metallicities as the modeled metallicities
at the maximum values of R3 and R23. Considering the dispersion
of the calibration, this approach resulted in 12 + log(O/H)p3 =

we obtained 12 + log(O/H)o302 = 7.79 + 0.14, slightly lower than
the above values. On the other hand, log R2 yields a metallicity of
12 + log(O/H)r2 = 7.82 + 0.20. These measurements are consistent
with each other within uncertainties. We take the metallicity derived
from R23 diagnostics as the fiducial value from strong-line method.
12 + log(O/H)p23 corresponds to Z/Z = 0.24 + 0.07, consistent
with the metallicity derived from SED fitting in §3.

4.4 Measure SFR From Hf Line

We measured SFR based on Ha emission inferred from the observed
Hf emission. Dust extinction was corrected following the same pro-
cedure described in §4.3. We assumed the intrinsic intensity ratio
of Ha and Hf is 2.863 for case B recombination at T. = 10, 000K,
ne = 100cm~? (Osterbrock & Ferland 2006). We then obtained
the intrinsic luminosity of Ha emission and applied the conversion
factor for Ha from Kennicutt & Evans (2012) to infer the SFR.
The resulting value is log(SFR/Mo yr~!) = 1.78 + 0.12. Since the
calibration of Kennicutt & Evans (2012) assumes solar metallicity,
and our target has a significantly lower metallicity, we corrected for
the metallicity effect using the spectral model from Inoue (2011).
Specifically, Inoue (2011) shows that, for a constant star formation
of 10 Myr and a LyC escape fraction of fee = 0, the ratio of HB
luminosity and SFR at Z ~ 0.2Zo is approximately 16/11 times
larger than the ratio at Z ~ Zo. Consequently, the SFR corrected
for the metallicity effect is reduced by a factor of ~ 11/16, yield-
ing log(SFR/Mo yr~!) = 1.62 + 0.12. The assumption of electron
temperature has a negligible effect on the final results. For instance,
supposing T, = 20,000 K only reduces the estimated SFR by 4 per
cent.

Aside from metallicity, the derived SFR is also very sensitive
to stellar age when it is < 10 Myr. Sugahara et al. (2022) estab-
lished relation between H@ luminosity and SFR considering effects
from simple stellar population (SSP) models, metallicity and stel-
lar ages. Adopting Starburst99 models (Leitherer et al. 1999, 2014),
also used for calibrations in Kennicutt & Evans (2012), a metallicity
of Z ~ 0.2Ze and a stellar age of 10 Myr yields the same SFR
as derived above. However, adopting an age of 1.8 Myr (ie. the
mass-weighted mean age) increases the obtained SFR by 0.3 dex,
resulting in log(SFR/Mo yr~!) = 1.93 + 0.12. Assuming BPASS
models which incorporate massive star binaries and better represent
high-z galaxies (Eldridge et al. 2017) does not result in a very differ-
ent SFR, which decreases by only 0.08 dex and 0.05 dex for age of
10 Myr and 1.8 Myr, respectively.

Previously, Inoue et al. (2016) measured the SFR using SED fitting
with data from Subaru, UKIRT, and Spitzer telescopes. The derived
SFR is 3474586 Mo yr! with a stellar age of only ~ 1 Myr. In this
work, our SED fitting yields an instantaneous SFR of ~ 165 Mo yr7!
and a mass-weighted mean age of ~ 2 Myr (Table 3). Given that
the lifetimes of stars traced by emission lines from ionized gas are
typically ~ 3 — 10 Myr (Kennicutt & Evans 2012), averaging the
instantaneous SFR over 10 Myr would yield a SFR of ~ 1/5 x
SFRsgp = 33 Mo yr~!, consistent with the SFR derived from Hf.

5 DISCUSSION
5.1 Optical [O m1] Outflows

As discussed in §4.2, we identified a broad component in the
[O 11]45008 emission, indicative presence of ionized gas outflows. In
this section, we present analysis and discussions about the properties
of the outflows.

5.1.1 Outflow Velocity

We derived the outflow velocity using equation (1) in Carniani et al.
(2024c). Unlike the approach in §4.2, we performed double Gaussian
fitting on [O 111]A5008 without constraining the central wavelengths
of narrow and broad components to be identical in order to measure
the velocity offset between them. The resulting velocity offset is
—0.7 + 43.7kms~!. We then substituted the velocity offset and the
intrinsic velocity dispersion of the broad component to the equation,
obtaining an outflow velocity of 535 + 132kms~!. The uncertainty
is measured by propagating the uncertainties of both the velocity
offset and the velocity dispersion. This velocity is consistent with
z ~ 3.5 — 6.9 JADES samples (Carniani et al. 2024c). It also agrees
with the outflow velocities measured from metal absorption lines in
z ~ 5-6 SFGs (Sugahara et al. 2019).

We further estimated the escape velocity to determine if the out-
flowing material can escape from the gravitational potential of the
dark matter halos of our target. We estimated the halo mass based
on the stellar mass-halo mass relation at z = 7 from Behroozi et al.
(2013), yielding M, ~ 5x10!° Mo. We then derived the virial radius
using the following equation:

vir = __3My a dd)
47 200perie (2) ”

where Perit (z) is the critical density of the Universe at a given red-
shift. The resulting virial radius is 13.8 kpc. Furthermore, adopting
the following equation:

1/2
Vese = (24) Q)

Tyir

we estimated an escape velocity of ~ 177kms~!, approximately

three times smaller than the outflow velocity. However, the outflow
velocity should be treated as an upper limit according to its definition,
and only a small fraction of the outflowing material is moving with
this high velocity. Thus, only part of the outflows may escape the
gravitational potential of the dark matter halos and it might have
negligible effect on quenching the galaxy.

5.1.2 Mass Loading Factor

We constructed moment-0 maps of narrow and broad [O 11]A5008
emission by integrating over the velocity ranges corresponding to the
narrow and broad components, respectively (Fig. 6). We employed
the following equation to calculate the mass outflow rate:

Mou = VoutMout/ Rout (3)

where Vout is the outflow velocity, Mou is the outflow mass, and
Rout is the radius of the outflow region. We adopted the half-light
radius of the broad [O 111]A5008 component as the outflow radius. We
determined this radius through curve of growth analysis on moment-
0 map of the broad [O 11]A5008 using Photutils (Bradley et al. 2024).
We added a 31 per cent uncertainty derived from line integration for
broad [O 1145008 (Table 4) to the total flux of broad [O m1], yielding

a value of roy = 1.86 + 0.63 kpc (Table 5). We did not account for
the PSF size (~ | kpc) in this estimation, because it has a negligible
impact on the derived size and mass outflow rate (~ 0.02 dex).
The outflows would require ~ 3.4 Myr to reach this spatial extent,
given the measured outflow velocity. Notably, the outflow radius of
our galaxy is approximately a factor of 4.8 larger than the median
value of the JADES samples, as they were determined from half-
light radius of galaxies in NIRCam images (Carniani et al. 2024c).
Similarly, for our target, the half-light radii of UV continuum in SW
images and optical emission in F444W are ~ 0.46 and ~ 0.78 kpc,
approximately a factor of 4 and 2.4 smaller than the one derived from
broad [O 111]45008, respectively.

The outflow mass was determined using the equation (6) in Car-
niani et al. (2024c):

We assumed the outflow metallicity to be the gas-phase metallic-
ity derived from SED fitting (Table 3), following Carniani et al.
(2024c). The predicted electron density for galaxies at z = 7.212 is
log(ne /em~>) = 2.83+0.43 (Abdurro’ uf et al. 2024), while the elec-
tron density of our target constrained by [O 11] 52 zm emission has a
1 o upper limit of approximately < 150 cm~? (Ren at al. in prepara-
tion). The densities in Abdurro’uf et al. (2024) were derived through
[O 1] doublet which may trace different ionized gas regions compared
to [O m1], leading to the density variations in the two measurements.
Similarly, Carniani et al. (2024c) adopted a typical electron density of
380 cm~? in outflows at z ~ 2, determined by [S 1m] doublet (Forster
Schreiber et al. 2019). Consequently, we adopted the typical value
of 380cm7> and assumed a 0.4 dex uncertainty, considering both
the constraints from [O 11] 52 zm emission and the density-redshift
evolution. Additionally, we corrected for dust extinction in broad
[O 11]45008 following the same procedure outlined in §4.3. The de-
rived outflow mass is log(Mou/Mo) = 8.02 + 0.43, resulting in a

" Defined as the stellar mass formed when a bursty star
formation happens at z = 20.

mass outflow rate of log(Mou/Mo yr7!) = 1.49 + 0.47. The Mou
and Moy of our target are 1.4 and 1.0 dex higher than the median
values of the JADES samples, respectively. These differences likely
arise from the bright [Om] broad component of our target, which
has a peak flux density up to ~ 2 orders of magnitude higher than
that of JADES samples (Carniani et al. 2024c).

Using the instantaneous SFR measured from SED fitting and
adopting the relation 7 = Mow/SFR, the derived mass loading
factor is logy = —0.73 + 0.47. The median of this value is lower
than that of all the JADES samples and the prediction by simula-
tions. However, it aligns with the observed anti-correlation between
n and M,, given that the stellar mass of our target is comparable to
the upper limit of the stellar mass range of the samples. This low
value also results from the bursty SF phase in our galaxy, where

the instantaneous SFR reaches ~ 165 Mo yr~!, compared to the 10
Myr-averaged SFRs adopted in Carniani et al. (2024c). To facilitate
a direct comparison, we estimated the SFR averaged over 10 Myr
for our galaxy by dividing the stellar mass by 10 Myr, resulting in
a value of log(SFRio/Mo yr7!) = 1.58 + 0.05. We note that this
SFR agrees well with the SFR derived from Hf emission (Table 5;
§4.4). While it is still 1.2 dex higher than the median SFRs of JADES
samples, the adjusted mass loading factor of logy = —0.09 + 0.47
is consistent with both the JADES samples and the predicted value
for ionized outflows from FIRE-2 simulation at the stellar mass of
our target (Pandya et al. 2021; Carniani et al. 2024c). Notably, since
the outflow velocity represents the highest speed of the outflows, the
derived mass loading factor may also represent an upper limit.

Fluetsch et al. (2019) studied multiphase outflows in local star-
forming galaxies and AGNs, finding that starburst-driven ionized
outflows and molecular outflows exhibits similar mass outflow rates.
The comparison of neutral atomic outflows and molecular outflows
is more complex. While their mass outflow rates typically differ by
less than one order of magnitude, the sample volume is very limited.
Consequently, the total mass outflow rate and mass loading factor
of our target could be up to ~ | dex higher than the measurements
of ionized outflows alone. So far, ALMA observations have found
no broad component of [C 11] 158 zm emission in our target (Inoue
et al. 2016; Carniani et al. 2020; Ren et al. 2023). However, given
that [C11] was marginally detected at ~ 4c, deeper observations
are necessary to identify the potential broad component and probe
neutral outflows.

We attempt to estimate the properties of neutral gas outflows using
sensitivity of ALMA [Cu] dataset. The outflows traced by broa
[C 11] are mostly in the neutral atomic phase because the majority of
¢ [C 11] emission comes from gas in the atomic phase. Assuming that
¢ potential broad component of [C 11] has the same FWHM as broai
O 11JA5008, we generated a moment-0 map of the potential broa
Cu] by integrating over -630 to +620 kms~! (approximately twice
1¢ FWHM of broad [O m1]) while excluding the channels that cover
e narrow [C 11] (-80 to +145 km s7! Ren et al. 2023). We measure
¢ 30 upper limit for the broad [C 1m] luminosity, which is Leeit <
0 x 108 Lo. Then, to estimate the atomic outflow mass from the
broad [C 1] luminosity, we adopted the conversion factor xc given
by equation (C.3) in Herrera-~Camus et al. (2021). Specifically, we
assumed a neutral gas temperature of T = 100 K to derive the critical
ensity for [C m1] against hydrogen atoms, which is ~ 3x 10° cm73. We
adopted the metallicity measured from R23 diagnostics to estimate
the carbon abundance, yielding yc+ = 1.9 x 10~>. We also assume
a neutral gas density of n = 10+cm~3. Therefore, we obtained a
conversion factor of ktcny) = 20.2Mo6L;!, resulting in an atomic
outflow mass of < 2.0 x 10°Mo. Assuming that the atomic gas
outflows has the same velocity and spatial extent as the ionize
outflows, the mass outflow rate and mass loading factor of atomic
gas outflows are log( Mun, ou /Mo yr7!) < 2.8 andlog(m10, nu) < 1.2,
respectively. These values are < 1.3 dex larger than those of ionize
gas outflows. Recent observations of ionized and atomic gas outflows
in a main-sequence SFG at z ~ 5.5 reported an atomic mass outflow
rate more than one dex larger than the ionized one (Parlanti et al.
2025). Considering that our estimates are upper limits, our results
may be consistent with recent high-z observations. However, we
have to note that these estimates are very uncertain because they are
derived based on many assumptions.

The total mass loading factor of all phases of gas may be larger
than one, in which case the outflow-driven mechanisms are likely
to quench the star formation effectively (e.g., Carniani et al. 2024c).

MNRAS 000, 1-20 (2025)

However, considering the large uncertainties of the estimated mass
loading factors, it is uncertain whether the outflows can effectively
quench the star formation in our target.

5.2 Dynamical Mass, Gas Mass and Gas Depletion Time
5.2.1 Dynamical Mass

We estimated the dynamical mass of our target using ALMA ob-
servations of [Cu] 158 wm emission (Ren et al. 2023). The [Cu]
observations yield a detection of 4.5@ or 3.60 when integrating
with or without one suspicious edge bin. Our analysis on both dy-
namical mass and gas mass primarily adopts the 4.5 o detection but
includes discussion of potential effects arising from the 3.6 a detec-
tion. Given the absence of spatially resolved velocity information,
we computed dynamical mass under both dispersion- and rotation-
dominated assumptions. For the dispersion-dominated scenario, we
applied equation (6) from Decarli et al. (2018):

3 Ric) Fine
2. G
The radius of the [Cu]-emitting region was taken as the beam-
deconvolved semi-major axis FWHM of the source size (5.1 + 2.7
kpc), derived from 2D Gaussian fitting. However, the [C 1] distri-
bution is elongated with the minor axis being unresolved, leading
to substantial uncertainty in the size measurement (see Fig. 6 in
Ren et al. 2023). Additionally, we adopted a velocity dispersion of
98.1 + 36.9kms~! determined by line FWHM (231 + 87kms~!),
which yielded a dynamical mass of Mayn = (1.71 + 1.57) x 10!° Mo.
The extremely large uncertainty (~ 90 per cent) is dominated by the
uncertainty in velocity dispersion (38 per cent), which appears as a
squared term in the equation.

In the rotation-dominated case, we assumed an inclination angle
of 45° and employed equation (7) from Decarli et al. (2018):

Mayn = (5)

Moyn = G7! Ri cry (0.75 FWHM/sini)” , (6)

resulting in Mayn = (7.13 + 6.54) x 10!° Mo. Since we assumed an
average angle of 45°, smaller than the assumption adopted in Decarli
et al. (2018), the resulting dynamical mass is approximately a factor
of 4.2 larger than the dispersion-dominated scenario. The extremely
large uncertainty arises from the same reason as the dispersion-
dominated case. For the 3.6 a0 detection case, both major and minor
axes of its distribution are unresolved. Assuming the major axis is
roughly half that of the 4.5 case based on visual inspection and
the change of FWHM is minimal, the dynamical mass decreases by
approximately half in both scenarios.

We also estimated dynamical mass using [O 11]A5008 emission.
Considering that the outflowing component is not gravitationally
bound to the galaxy, we derived the dynamical mass from the nar-
row [Om] component. The half-light radius of narrow [O m1] (right
panel of Fig. 6) is determined through curve of growth analysis us-
ing Photutils (Bradley et al. 2024). Similar to the measurement of
broad component (§5.1.2), we propagated a 26 per cent uncertainty
obtained from line integration for narrow [O 11]45008 to the total
flux of narrow [O m1], yielding a value of 0.90 + 0.23 kpe (Table 5).
Given that the line width of narrow [O m1] is unresolved, we adopted
the intrinsic [Om] line width derived from single Gaussian fitting
(Table 4). The obtained dynamical mass is (2.1 + 0.8) x 10? Mo
and (8.8 + 3.5) x 10°Mo for dispersion- and rotation-dominated
scenarios, respectively (deconvolving the radius with the PSF size
would reduce the estimated mass by 0.8 dex). In both cases, the
[O 11]-based dynamical mass is one order of magnitude lower than

MNRAS 000, 1-20 (2025)

the [C u]-based values, primarily because the [C 1] radius is roughly
a factor of 6 larger than that of narrow [Out]. This is expected,
because [O m1] originates from Hu regions, while [C1] is predom-
inantly emitted from more extended neutral gas clouds surrounding
the ionized bubbles. ALMA observations of [O 1m] and [C 11] emitters
at z > 6 have shown that the [C 1] halos are typically more extended
compared to [O m1] (Carniani et al. 2020; Fujimoto et al. 2024).

5.2.2 Gas Mass

We further estimated molecular gas mass using the conversion fac-
tor between [Cu] luminosity and molecular gas mass for high-z
galaxies, which is @jcn) = 35 Mo/Lo with a dispersion of 0.2 dex
(Zanella et al. 2018). The [Cm] luminosity for the 4.5 0 detection
is (1.2 + 0.5) x 108 Lo (Ren et al. 2023), yielding a molecular gas
mass of Moi = 0.46*0-33 x 10!° Mo. The median values and uncer-
tainties were determined through the 16th, 50th and 84th percentiles
of Monte Carlo simulations, with this approach applied for all rele-
vant measurements. Additionally, we measured H1 gas mass using
(C u]-to-H1 conversion relation from Heintz et al. (2021, 2023b).
Adopting the metallicity derived from SED fitting and the [Cu]
luminosity of the 4.5a@ detection, we obtained an H1 gas mass
of My = 1.42*0-8* x 10!°Mo. Therefore, the total gas mass is
Meas = Mmot + Mut = 1.93793 x 10!°Mo. Combined with the
stellar mass determined from SED fitting, the total baryonic mass
is Mgas + My = 197408 x 10!°Mo, consistent with the dynami-
cal mass estimated for dispersion-dominated scenario. For case of
[C m1] detected at 3.6 7, since the luminosity decreases by a factor of
two (Ren et al. 2023), the inferred gas mass measurements similarly
decrease by roughly half.

5.2.3 Gas Mass Excess, Gas Mass Fraction and Gas Depletion
Time

From the mass measurements of different baryonic components, we
derived a gas mass excess of log(Mgas/M.) = 1.70*0-57 and a gas
mass fraction of fas = Mgas/(Mgas + M.) ~ 98 per cent. Assuming
aconstant star formation history with the instantaneous SFR derived
from SED fitting, the gas depletion time is tgep) = 114*93 Myr, de-
fined as Mgas/SFR without considering gas inflows and outflows.
Alternatively, adopting the SFR measured from Hf emission yielded
a longer depletion time of fdepi = 445ten Myr. These values of fdepi
are consistent with simulated starbursts at high redshifts (Ceverino
et al. 2018; Dome et al. 2024). Different SFR tracers suggest our
galaxy may be quenched at z ~ 6.5 or z ~ 5, respectively. With a
current gas mass of ~ 1.9 x 10!° Mo, the total stellar mass formed
prior to quenching may reach a similar order of magnitude. Conse-
quently, SXDF may be one of the progenitors of massive quiescent
galaxies observed at z ~ 4 — 5 (Carnall et al. 2023; de Graaff et al.
2025).

For the case of 3.60 [Cu] detection, while the gas mass excess
and gas depletion times decrease by a factor of ~ 2, the gas mass
fraction remains high at ~ 96%. Heintz et al. (2023b) reported that
z ~ 4-8 galaxies have elevated gas mass excess and shorter gas
depletion times compared to z ~ 0 samples. Our results align with
the high-z samples for both 4.5 and 3.6a cases. The extremely
high gas mass fraction of our target is also consistent with some of
the z = 4 samples (Heintz et al. 2023b).

5.3 Spatial Distribution of UV continuum, Optical [O m1] and
[O 111] 88 ym lines

We compare the spatial distribution of UV continuum an
[Om] 88 wm emission by plotting the [O 1m] 88 zm emission from
combined ALMA Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 dataset on F115W image (left
panel of Fig. 7). We also compare the spatial distribution of optical
and FIR [Om] emission by plotting the ALMA [O 11] 88 ym con-
tours and optical [O 11] doublet contours derived from NIRSpec IFS
on F444W image (right panel of Fig. 7).

In both panels of Fig. 7, the southern clump of [O 111] 88 zm emis-
sion is spatially aligned with the peak positions of UV continuum ani
optical [O 1m] emission. In the right panel, the spatial distributions
of optical [O m1] and the emission in F444W are very similar, as the
optical [O m1] emission contributes to the majority of light in F444W.
Additionally, the northern clump of [O 11] 88 zm emission exhibits
spatial alignment with the diffuse northern emission of F444W ani
optical [O m1].

Ren et al. (2023) argued that [O 11] 88 zm emission in this galaxy
may have two to three clumps. An isolated northwest clump detecte:
at ~ 3 may be real or attributed to noise. In this work, we foun
this isolated clump appears spatially aligned with the 1 7 contour of
optical [O 1m] emission, implying this northwest clump might be real.
Both this clump and the northern clump of [Om] 88 zm emission
could enfold some obscured or dim star-forming regions that are
invisible in F115W. Ren et al. (2023) found that the northern clump
consists of two velocity components, one is blue-shifted and the other
one is red-shifted with a velocity separation of ~ 380kms~!. This
exceeds the width of narrow [O 11]A5008 but remains narrower than
the broad [O 11]A5008. Additionally, both the southern and northwest
clumps display blue-shifted velocities with FWHMs = 250kms~!.
These velocity shifts and broadening components may originate from
stellar winds or supernova explosions.

The [O 111] 88 zm emission shows a clumpy structure but the opti-
cal [O m1] appears smoothly distributed. This is likely due to different
critical densities of [O 111] 88 zm emission and optical [O 1m] emis-
sion (5.1 x 10? cm™? and 6.8 x 10° cm~, respectively; Osterbrock &
Ferland 2006) and the inhomogeneous density distribution within the
galaxy’s Hu regions. In particular, the valley between the southern
and northern clumps of FIR [O 11] may represent a region where the
electron density exceeds the critical density of [O m1] 88 zm emis-
sion, thus suppressing the FIR [O m1] emission there. Alternatively,
the seemingly clumpy structure of FIR [Om] emission may result
from observational effects. ALMA’s high angular resolution is pos-
sible to make smooth disks look clumpy (Gullberg et al. 2018), sug-
gesting that the clumpy morphology of FIR [O11] may be artefact.
Furthermore, since the peak S/N of FIR [O 11] is only 4.80, much
smaller than that of optical [O m1], the undetected diffuse emission in
the outer region of FIR [O m1] could be attributed to the insufficient
sensitivity. Deeper ALMA observations are of importance to probe
the diffuse emission of FIR [Om].

The UV continuum exhibits an elongated morphology along the
east-west direction, suggesting that we are likely observing the galaxy
disk from edge-on direction, and the more extended and diffuse con-
tinuum in longer wavelengths as well as the [O 11]AA4960, 5008
emission form an ellipsoidal or spherical ionized halo surrounding
the disk. However, this structure could also be caused by decreas-
ing resolutions at longer wavelengths. The UV continuum in F115W
and F150W looks clumpy too (Fig. 1); thus, it is also possible that
our target is a chain galaxy (Elmegreen et al. 2004). Both the UV
continuum and [O 1m] 88 zm emission show a tail-like structure ex-
tending toward the west (Fig. 1; Fig. 7), likely indicating the presence

of diffuse star-forming regions adjacent to the central star-forming
clusters. The elongated, clumpy and tail-like structures of the emis-
sion may also result from galaxy-merging events, which boost the
current bursty star formation. Indeed, at the redshift of SXDF (i.e.
z ~ 7), recent JWST observations have shown a high prevalence of
clumpy galaxies and/or close merging companions (e.g., Harikane
et al. 2025).

5.4 Potential Old stellar Population

The mass-weighted mean ages from all SFH models are ~ 1 —2 Myr
(Table 3), which is even smaller than the lifetime of the most massive
stars (Buzzoni 2002). However, the observed emission lines and the
SED fitting suggest a metallicity of ~ 0.1 — 0.2 Zo. Even an inferred
age of ~ 10 Myr since onset of SF remains challenging to reconcile
with the derived chemical abundance, suggesting potential presence
of old stellar populations responsible for the metal enrichment in this
galaxy.

5.4.1 Reconstruct Past Star Formation History with SED Fitting

We first attempt to reconstruct old stellar assembly histories us-
ing SED fitting. As mentioned in §3.2, when fitting with the non-
parametric SFH with a continuity prior, the choice of the earliest age
bin may influence both the onset time of SF and the output of stellar
mass. Adopting an earliest age bin at 20 Myr yields age and stellar
mass consistent with results from parametric models. In contrast,
setting the earliest age bin at z = 20 results in a mass-weighted mean
age of ~ 10 Myr and a timescale since onset of SF of 10*2°° Myr. The
large upper uncertainty implies the possible presence of previous SF
activities (bottom left panel of Fig. Al).

Furthermore, fitting a non-parametric model with a Dirichlet prior
and a concentration parameter of a < 1 allows for sharp changes in
SFR, such as bursts, rapid quenching and rejuvenation events, while
q@ > | suppresses abrupt SFR variations, similar to the effect of a
continuity prior (Leja et al. 2019). Thus, to explore if drastic SF
activities were present in the past SFH, we performed SED fitting
employing a non-parametric model with a Dirichlet prior and a = 0.2
using Dense Basis (Iyer et al. 2019).

We only input NIRCam photometries in this fitting. Since old
populations primarily contribute to fluxes at rest-frame A > 4000 A,
excluding constraints from [O 11] emission lines and undetected dust
continuum has minimal impact on SFH reconstruction. We fixed
metallicity, redshift and dust attenuation by adopting very tight pri-
ors centered on values derived from Bagpipes fittings, allowing the
maximum lookback times to be N = 3.

As a result, the derived stellar mass of log(M./Mo) = 8,59 8s
is consistent with the Bagpipes results, and the instantaneous SFR
of log(SFR/Mo yr!) = 1,62°9-17 also agrees well with the SFR
inferred from Hf emission. The reconstructed SFH suggests a flat,
moderate star formation beginning from soon after the Big Bang
to the recent burst (Fig. A2), which may imply the presence of old
populations. Even though we defined a low a of 0.2, the median
distribution of SFH implies no sharp SFR changes in the past.

5.4.2. Maximum Old Stellar Mass

We further try to estimate the maximum possible mass of the potential
old stellar populations. Given that the flux densities of stellar pop-
ulations with ages > 0.4 Gyr peak at rest-frame ~ 4000 A(Bruzual
& Charlot 2003), we utilized the discrepancy between observed and

The background images are from F115W in the left panel and from F444W in the right panel. The grey contours in both images are [2, 3, 4] o [O 11] 88 xm emis-

after 3 o clipping in the entire FoVs of the images. The dark grey circles in the bottom right corner of both images indicate the beam size of ALMA Cycle 2+3
observations, which is 0/'17 x 01/16. The green circles in both images show PSF FWHMs of F115W and F444W, which are 0°’066 and 02161 (Finkelstein et al.
2023), respectively. The white circle in the right panel shows the PSF FWHM of the NIRSpec spectrum at the wavelength range of optical [O m1] doublet, which

is 0(195 measured from simulated PSF using STPSF (Perrin et al. 2014).

modeled flux in F356W from the t SFH model fit to estimate the max-
imum possible mass of potential old stellar populations. We assumed
that this flux discrepancy is completely due to the contribution of the
old populations. To measure their mass, we performed SED fitting
while assuming a bursty star formation occurred at z = 20, followed
by a passive evolution, because the earliest galaxy formation is ex-
pected to start around this time (Robertson 2022). We fitted a constant
SFH model, where the onset of star formation is at the cosmic age
of 0.175 Gyr (corresponding to z = 20) and the duration is 10 Myr.
We assumed a 10 per cent error floor for the flux of old population in
F356W. We also assumed the metallicity of the gas cloud at z ~ 20 is
as low as the most metal-poor galaxy so far found in the local Universe
(~ 1/50 Zo, I Zw 18, Izotov & Thuan 1999) and the dust attenuation
at z ~ 20 is 0.01 mag. Consequently, the estimated maximum un-
derlying old stellar mass is log(Mo!4/Mo) = 9.50 + 0.04, which we
adopt as an upper limit of log(M2"4/Mo) < 9.5. This constraint is
1.2 dex more stringent than that of Inoue et al. (2016), who derived
the potential old mass using flux upper limit in Spitzer IRAC 3.6 um,
much brighter than F356W. Additionally, assuming a bursty SF oc-
curred at a later time (z = 10) with a higher metallicity (Z/Zo = 0.1)
reduces the potential old mass by only ~ 0.2 dex. After incorporating
the flux contribution from old populations at the effective wavelength
of F356W, the discrepancy between the modeled and observed flux
in F356W is resolved. The presence of the old populations can be
supported by FirstLight simulations, which predicted that the typical

MNRAS 000, 1-20 (2025)

stellar mass of z ~ 6 starburst galaxies above the main sequence with
Muy ~ —22 is approximately log(M,./Mo) ~ 9.3 - 9.5 (Ceverino
et al. 2019). Meanwhile, Langan et al. (2020) and Nakazato et al.
(2023) reported that simulated starbursts at z = 7 with metallicities
comparable to SXDF could have stellar masses up to ~ 10° Mo.

5.4.3. Use MIRI to Trace Old Populations

The presence of the potential old stellar populations can be confirmed
with future MIRI observations. For our target, MIRI F770W is the
most useful band to trace old populations, because Ha emission
may outshine the stellar continuum in F560W, and F770W offers
the second-best sensitivity while minimizing contamination from
emission lines.

To predict the observed flux in F770W, we combined the posterior
spectrum of young populations derived from SED fitting with the
model spectrum of potential old populations, integrating over the
F770W bandpass. This yielded an expected flux density of 0.23 +
0.02 yJy. Given that the 10 o sensitivity limit of F770W is 0.24 uly
fora 10 ksec exposure , the predicted S/N with a two-hour integration
would reach ~ 8.0. It would be enough to securely confirm the
existence of old populations, and to constrain further the SFH of

JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec study of a galaxy atz=7.212 15

this source up to very early epochs (z ~ 20). Conversely, in the
absence of old populations, the expected flux density decreases to
0.17 + 0.02 wJy, corresponding to a predicted S/N of ~ 5.9 o for the
same exposure time. In summary, the brightness of emission detected
in F770W of future MIRI observations can confirm the presence of
old stellar populations, and further constrain the stellar mass and
SFH of our target.

Among MIRI imaging filters, FIOOOW and F1280W have the
third- and fourth-best sensitivities, respectively. Appying the same
calculation approach described above, the predicted S/Ns are only
3.70 (FLO00W) and ~ 1.1 0 (F1280W) for a two-hour integration,
assuming the presence of old populations. Thus, F770W is the most
viable band to investigate the potential old stellar populations in our
target. Although the predicted S/N is modest in F1000W and very low
in F1280W, these observations may still be valuable for constraining
the old stellar populations and tracing hot dust.

Recent JWST studies have reported young stellar ages (a few to
dozens of Myr) in high-z galaxies exhibiting bursty star formations
(e.g. Endsley et al. 2023; Tang et al. 2023; Chen et al. 2023; Looser
et al. 2023; Sugahara et al. 2025). Such short timescales appear in-
sufficient to account for the observed chemical abundance, implying
the presence of underlying old stellar populations in these galaxies.
JWST NIRCam observations of a local extremely metal-poor galaxy
I Zw 18, which is considered as a local analogue of high-z galaxies,
have identified evidence of stellar populations older than 1 Gyr in
this system (Bortolini et al. 2024). This emphasizes the importance
of rest-frame NIR photometry on probing old stellar populations.
Moreover, MIRI imaging is crucial for studying cosmic stellar mass
density at high-z (Papovich et al. 2023). Utilizing MIRI’s capability,
we can probe the stellar populations at much earlier cosmic epochs
than those corresponding to the observed redshifts of high-z galaxies.

5.5 Ionization and ISM Condition

Since F115W’s bandpass covers rest-frame 1500 A, we measure:
the absolute UV magnitude using the observed total flux density in
this filter. Following the dust extinction correction approach outline:
in §4.3, we obtained Myy = —22.1 + 0.2, consistent with previous
measurement in Shibuya et al. (2012). Moreover, we derived the rest-
frame EW of [Om]+H using the model continuum level obtaine
from the posterior distribution of SED fitting, yielding an extremely
high value of 3700 + 370A. It places our target at the upper end of
JWST-detected z ~ 6.5 — 8 and z ~ 6 — 9 galaxies from CEERS an
JADES surveys, respectively, whereas it is comparable with sources
exhibiting Balmer jumps in their modeled SEDs (Endsley et al. 2023,
2024). We also computed the EW of Lya emission. We estimated the
continuum level of Lya@ using the UV slope derived from modele
SED (Table 5) and the observed F115W flux density. Given the
Lya flux of 1973 x 107!7 erg s~!cm~? (Shibuya et al. 2012), we
derived an EW of 3088 A, consistent with the value obtained using
continuum level from UKIRT J band observations (Ren et al. 2023).

We also estimated the ionizing photon production rate employ-
ing equation (4) from Reddy et al. (2023b), which assumes no
dust absorption of ionizing photons or leakage into the intergalactic
medium (IGM). By substituting the predicted intrinsic Ha luminos-
ity into the equation, we obtained log(Q/s~!) = 54.9 + 0.1. We
further determined ionizing photon production efficiency following
€ion = Q/Ly, where L,, represents the intrinsic rest-frame UV lu-
minosity density at 1500 A. We determined L,, using observed flux
density in F115W after applying corrections for both cosmological
expansion and dust extinction. We corrected for dust extinction fol-

lowing the same procedure outlined in §4.3. The obtained value is
log(Eion/erg~! Hz) = 25.44 40.15, which agrees well with the mea-
surement from Inoue et al. (2016). The €ion is also consistent with
galaxies at z = 6 identified by JWST spectroscopic observations
(Alvarez-Marquez et al. 2024, 2025) and strong LAEs at 5 < z < 8
observed by JWST NIRSpec (Heintz et al. 2025).

The ionization parameter derived from SED fitting (log U ~ —1.6)
is higher than those of local Hu regions (Kewley & Dopita 2002),
and consistent with the highest estimated values of z ~ 1.3 — 2.3
SFGs within uncertainties (Masters et al. 2014). The marginally de-
tected [Ne 11]43870 and [Om] doublet emission enable the estima-
tion of log U through 032 ([O m1]A14960, 5008/[O 11123727, 3730),
Ne302 ([{Ne 11]A3870/[O 11]2.43727, 3730) and R23 (([O 11]A14960,
5008 + [O 1]413727, 3730)/HB) proxies. The derived dust-corrected
line ratios are O32 = 8.3°63, log Ne302 = 0.06 + 0.20 and
R23 = 15.1*39 3. The measured 032, Ne302 ratios and the log U
derived from SED fitting place our target at the upper ranges of
z ~ 2.7-6.3 and z ~ 7—9 SFGs selected from JWST CEERS survey.
Nevertheless, our derived log U aligns with the model-inferred log U
of z ~ 2.7 — 6.3 samples with comparable 032 and Ne30O2 ratios,
and the log U vs. 032, 032 vs. Ne302 and 032 vs. EW([{O 11]+Hf)
of our target show consistency with z > 7 LAEs (Reddy et al. 2023b;
Tang et al. 2023). Moreover, while the R23 ratio places our target at
the upper range of z ~ 5.5 — 9.5 JWST JADES sources, both 032
and Ne302 ratios match their stacked values (Cameron et al. 2023).

Recent studies by Reddy et al. (2023b) and Reddy et al. (2023a)
have established significant linear correlations between log U and
SFR surface density (Xspr), as well as between 032 and XYerp, for
star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2.7—6.3 and z ~ 1.6—2.6. We measured
srr of our target using equation (5) from Reddy et al. (2023b):

SFR
2nR.”
eff

ZsrR = (7)
We derived two estimates: (1) Uspr = 32.6 + 17.2Mo yr“! kpe~?
using instantaneous SFR derived from SED fitting, and (2) Usrr =
8.2 + 4.8Mo yr! kpe~? using H6-based SFR, while adopting the
effective radius of narrow component of [O 11]45008 emission (Ta-
ble 5). Both measurements place our target above the established
correlations of 032 vs. XsFR and log U vs. Usrr, whereas they align
with the most extreme 2.7 < z < 6.3 systems showing similarly el-
evated 032 (log U) and Xsrp (see Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 in Reddy et al.
2023b). More samples at z 2 7 with both O32 (log U) and Xsrr
measurements are necessary for studying their correlations in early
galaxies. Additionally, our target’s metallicity and log U show better
agreement with z 2 7 samples than with lower redshift samples (see
Fig. 7 in Reddy et al. 2023b).

5.6 Age-Mass and Mass-Metallicity Relations of
ALMA-detected and JWST-selected Galaxies

Prior to the JWST-era, star-forming galaxy candidates at z > 6
selected by past telescopes and successfully detected by ALMA
follow-up observations are generally bright in rest-frame UV or ben-
efited from strong gravitational magnification (e.g., Inoue et al. 2016;
Hashimoto et al. 2018; Tamura et al. 2019; Bouwens et al. 2022),
given the shallower detection limits of previous instruments and
competitive ALMA time. In this section, we investigate early galaxy
evolution by comparing the stellar mass, age, Muy and metallicity

3 Cameron et al. (2023) adopted 032 = log ({Om]A5008/[O 1]AA3727,
3730), which yields a value of log O32 = 1.17 + 0.14.

MNRAS 000, 1-20 (2025)
16 YY. W. Renet al.

of galaxies detected by both ALMA and JWST (hereafter ALMA-
detected galaxies) and galaxies selected by JWST observations. We
compiled a sample of 12 ALMA-detected galaxies at z > 6 from the
literature (including our target). We compared these galaxies with
JWST-selected galaxies from JADES and CEERS programs in terms
of stellar mass, age and Myy (Fig. 8). We further included 12 galax-
ies from REBELS program, other four ALMA-detected galaxies, and
galaxies from JWST ERO and GLASS programs to compare their
mass-metallicity relations (Fig. 9). More details of the plotted data
are presented in Appendix B.

5.6.1 Age-Mass Relation

In Fig. 8, most of the ALMA-detected galaxies occupy the upper left
region of the panels, exhibiting higher stellar mass, younger age and
brighter UV magnitude, compared to JWST-selected galaxies. Es-
pecially, when compared to the constant SFH (CSFH)-derived mass
of JWST-selected sources (left panel), the ALMA-detected galaxies
have significantly larger mass at similar ages. Although the non-
parametric continuity SFH may yield more mass particularly for
young systems, the ALMA-detected galaxies remain more massive
than the majority of the JWST-selected galaxies (right panel). Partic-
ularly, the age of our target is situated at the lowest region compared
to all the other galaxies, but it is significantly more massive than
other youngest galaxies.

There are three outliers, S04590, MACS1149-JD1 and A2744-
YD7. The mass of S04590 is very low (~ 07? Mo), and the mass
of MACS1149-JD1 (~ 10°? Mg) is consistent with JWST-selected
galaxies at similar ages (right panel of Fig. 8). Both systems benefit
from much stronger gravitational lensing effect than other magnified
sources, which enhanced their chance of being detected by ALMA.
Additionally, the age of YD7 (~ 195 Myr) is the oldest among
ALMA-detected samples and close to the upper age limit of JWST-
selected sources. This is because YD7 has two components, one
has young bursting populations (YD7-W), while the other one has
old star-forming activities and is recently quenched (YD7-E; Witten
et al. 2025). Thus, these three galaxies are not contradictory with the
overall trend showing ALMA-detected galaxies are typically more
massive and younger than JWST-selected galaxies.

We have to note, however, that this trend looks very significant
because most of the JWST-selected samples in Fig. 8 are from JADES
program, which has a median Muy of —18.3 for galaxies detected
by Endsley et al. (2024). This is much fainter than most ALMA-
detected galaxies and fainter than some other JWST projects like
CEERS (median Myy = —19.8 for samples in Nakajima et al. 2023),
considering the positive correlation between Myy and stellar mass
(eg., Endsley et al. 2024). In Fig. 9, with the complementary data from
other programs, the mass of ALMA-detected and JWST-selected
galaxies becomes more consistent; however, the mass of most ALMA
samples still occupies the higher value end.

The young but more massive nature of ALMA-detected galaxies
at z > 6 implies that these galaxies may have undergone more ef-
ficient mass assembly processes in their formation and evolution
histories. We calculated the clumpy and merger fractions of the
ALMA samples. B14-65666, COS-2987, COS-3018, Himiko, CR7,
MACS0416-Y1, MACS1149-JD1, BDF-3299 and COSMOS24108
show clumpy structures in UV continuum and evidence of past or on-
going merger activities (Sugahara et al. 2025; Mawatari et al. 2025;
Scholtz et al. 2025; Harikane et al. 2025; Kiyota et al. 2025; Harshan
et al. 2024; Marconcini et al. 2024; Venturi et al. 2024). Despite not
being clumpy in the stellar continuum, A2744-YD4 also shows evi-
dence of mergers, hinted by a flat metallicity gradient (Venturi et al.

MNRAS 000, 1-20 (2025)

2024). Furthermore, A2744-YD1, -YD4 and -YD7 are in a protoclus-
ter core where strong environmental effects can accelerate galaxy
evolution (Hashimoto et al. 2023), and they are predicted to be at the
verge of galaxy mergers by cosmological simulations (Nakazato et al.
2024). The clumpy structure of our target shown in F115W may also
result from merging events. The extended, blueshifted [C m] emission
in $04590 could be explained by merger activities as well (Heintz
et al. 2023b). Overall, the clumpy and merger (with strong evidence)
fractions of our compiled 16 ALMA-detected SFGs are 69 percent
and 63 percent, respectively. The clumpy fraction is consistent with
bright (Muy < —21.5) galaxies at z ~ 7 compiled by Harikane et al.
(2025) (66 + 14 percent), as our galaxies are also characterized by
bright UV color and massive stellar mass. The merger fraction of
our ALMA samples is much larger than the major merger fraction
determined by JWST-selected galaxies at z > 6 (~ 0.2; Duan et al.
2024), suggesting that galaxy interactions may play an important role
in accelerating the mass assembly in bright and massive galaxies like
ALMA-detected ones at z > 6.

Furthermore, while the JWST-selected faint, less massive and
young galaxies may have formed recently prior to the observed red-
shifts, the more massive ALMA-detected galaxies with similarly
young ages are more likely to have experienced past star-forming
activities that began dozens or even hundreds of Myr ago, as shown
by the analysis of potential old stellar populations in our target. The
ALMA-detected galaxies in the reionization epoch, which represent
a young but massive and bright galaxy population, likely underwent
more complex evolutionary pathways, such as the more frequent
merging activities discussed above.

5.6.2. Mass-Metallicity Relation

In Fig. 9, most of the ALMA-detected galaxies (including our com-
piled 16 galaxies and REBELS galaxies) show deviations from local
samples, consistent with other high-z samples. We conducted a linear
orthogonal distance regression fit to ALMA-detected galaxies using
the following functional form:

12 + log(O/H) = Blog(M./10° Mo) + Zo, (8)

where is the slope and Zg is the metallicity at the normalized stellar
mass of 10? Mo. We found B = 0.37 + 0.08 and Zy = 7.94 + 0.04.
The slope agrees well with that reported by Rowland et al. (2025)
who fitted REBELS data as well. It is steeper than the z ~ 3— 10 and
z ~ 4-10 relations of JWST-selected galaxies reported by Curti et al.
(2024) and Nakajima et al. (2023), respectively. Its median value is
also larger than the z ~ 2 — 3 relations in Sanders et al. (2021), the
z ~ 3-9.5 relation in Morishita et al. (2024) and the z ~ 7 - 10
relation in Heintz et al. (2023a). However, the slope of our samples
is consistent with these relations if considering large uncertainties.
In fact, our measured slope would be even steeper if considering
the potential old stellar mass in some targets or excluding low-mass
samples (i.e. S04590 and JD 1). This steep slope may be attributed to
the fact that the ALMA-detected galaxies at z > 6 are more massive,
but are dominated by young, massive and metal-poor stars.

6 CONCLUSION

In this work, we analyzed JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec observations
of a galaxy at z = 7.212, as part of the RIOJA project. We summarize
our conclusions as follows.

1. We observed our target using six NIRCam wideband filters at 1 —
5 um. The UV continuum in SW filters exhibits an elongated, clumpy

Figure 9. Mass-metallicity relation of JWST- and ALMA-detected galaxies. Our target is highlighted by the largest star. The JADES galaxies are from Curti et al.
(2024) and CEERS+ERO+GLASS galaxies are from Nakajima et al. (2023). Apart from the ALMA samples plotted in Fig. 8, we further included four galaxies
detected by ALMA at z > 6: CR7, A2744-YD1, BDF-3299 and COSMOS24108, and 12 REBELS galaxies from Rowland et al. (2025). The stars connected by
a black dashed line represent young and total mass (enclosed in a black rectangle). More detailed information of plotted data is presented in Appendix B. The
mass-metallicity relations at z ~ 0, z ~ 2—3 and z ~ 3 — 10 are from Curti et al. (2020); Sanders et al. (2021); Curti et al. (2024), respectively. The grey shaded
region indicates the 1 o uncertainty of the z ~ 3 — 10 relation (Curti et al. 2024). The mass-metallicity relation of z > 6 ALMA-detected galaxies (including
REBELS galaxies) is shown by the blue solid line, and the blue shaded region shows its 1 o uncertainty. The data points are color-coded by redshift.

morphology with a tail-like structure, suggesting an edge-on disk or
a chain galaxy. In contrast, the optical emission is more extended ani
smoothly distributed, which may result from decreasing resolutions
at longer wavelengths, or indicating the presence of optical halo.
The [Om] 88 «xm emission is also clumpy with a tail-like structure
extending toward the west. Thus, our target may has experience
galaxy merger events in the past.

2. We conducted NIRSpec IFS observations and identifie
[0 11]AA3727, 3730, [Ne 111]A3870, Hf and [O 111]2.14960, 5008 emis-
sion lines at galactic scales. We also detected blended Her +
[Neu] + He lines at ~ 3970A and Hy in a smaller aperture.
We detected a broad component of [O 1145008 with an extent of
re = 1.86 + 0.63 kpc, indicating the presence of prominent ionize:
gas outflows. The total mass loading factor may be larger than one.
However, due to the large uncertainties of the estimates, we can not
conclude whether the outflow-driven mechanisms can quench the
star formation in our target effectively.

3. We performed SED fitting using NIRCam photometries, line
fluxes of [O m1]A24960, 5008 and [O 11] 88 zm emission lines, as
well as dust continuum non-detections obtained from ALMA. Our
results show that our target is dominated by young stellar populations
and undergoing a bursty SF phase. The modeled SED exhibits a
prominent Balmer jump, indicating the presence of strong nebular
continuum. The derived ionization parameter, O32 and Ne3O2 line
ratios, and EW([Om]+H) are higher than the typical values of
high-z SFGs, but consistent with those of z > 7 LAEs.

4. We found the inferred young stellar ages from SED fitting
are insufficient to account for the observed chemical abundance of
~ 0.2 Zo, implying the presence of underlying old populations. The
estimated maximum old stellar mass is log(M°!4/Mo) < 9.5. MIRI
observations are essential for investigating the potential old stellar
populations and constraining the stellar mass and SFH of high-z
SFGs exhibiting young stellar ages. MIRI F770W is the most viable
band to probe the old populations for our target.

5. We compared the spatial distribution of [O m1] 88 zm emis-
sion, [O 11]224960, 5008 emission and UV continuum. The south-
ern clump of [O 11] 88 zm emission is spatially aligned with the peak
positions of UV continuum and optical [Om] emission, while the
northern clump of [O 11] 88 zm emission is aligned with the diffuse
northern emission of optical [Om]. Different structure of optical
and FIR [O m1] could be attributable to different critical densities of
these lines and inhomogeneous density distribution in the galaxy. The
clumpy structure of FIR [Om] may also be artefact resulted from
the high-angular resolution observation of ALMA. Deeper ALMA
observations would be necessary to trace the diffuse emission of FIR
[Om].

6. We derived dynamical mass, molecular gas mass and H1 gas
mass using [C u] observations obtained from ALMA. We estimated
gas depletion time using the derived gas mass and SFRs, yielding a
Taep! Of ~ 114 Myr or ~ 445 Myr, under different SFR assumptions.
This implies that our galaxy may be quenched at z ~ 6.5 or z ~ 5,
suggesting that our target may be one of the progenitors of observed
massive quiescent galaxies at z ~ 4—5.

7. We compared the age-mass and mass-metallicity relations of
JWST-selected galaxies and star-forming galaxies detected by both
JWST and ALMA at high redshifts. We found that, the ALMA-
detected galaxies at z > 6 are relatively more massive, younger, and
their mass-metallicity relation may have a steeper slope. Therefore,
the ALMA-detected galaxies at z > 6, which represent a young but
massive and UV-bright galaxy population, may have undergone more
efficient mass assembly processes in their formation and evolution
histories, as suggested by their high clumpy and merger fractions

MNRAS 000, 1-20 (2025)

(69 percent and 63 percent, respectively). The presence of potential
old stellar populations (e.g., in our target) also suggests that star
formation in the ALMA sources may have begun at a much earlier
time, compared to young but less massive galaxies.

APPENDIX A: SED FITTING RESULTS WITH VARYING
SFH MODELS

Fig. Al shows the SFHs reconstructed by BAGPIPES fittings. Fig.
A2 shows the SFH reconstructed by Dense basis fitting.

APPENDIX B: DETAILS OF GALAXIES PLOTTED IN FIG.
8 AND FIG. 9

For JWST-selected galaxies in Fig. 8, the ages are light-weighted
ages derived from BEAGLE SED fitting with a constant SFH (CSFH)
uniformly (Endsley et al. 2023; Tang et al. 2023; Chen et al. 2023;
Endsley et al. 2024), reflecting the ages of young populations with
recent bursts. However, Endsley et al. (2024) found that adopting a
non-parametric SFH with a continuity prior in PROSPECTOR could

MNRAS 000, 1-20 (2025)

yield approximately 0.8 dex (for agecsry < 10 Myr) or 0.3 dex (for
agecsru > 100 Myr) larger stellar mass compared to CSFH-derived
mass. This may suggests that the CSFH-derived mass represents
a lower limit, or the mass of young stellar populations, while the
mass from non-parametric continuity SFH implies an upper limit,
including potentially present older stellar populations. Therefore,
we plotted mass from CSFH in the left panel and mass from non-
parametric continuity SFH in the right panel in Fig. 8, for comparison.
The CEERS samples at 5 < z < 7.5 lack information of continuity-
derived mass (Chen et al. 2023), thus they are only plotted in the left
panel of Fig. 8.

In Fig. 9, the JWST-selected galaxies are compiled from different
papers with spectroscopic observations. The JADES samples are
from Curti et al. (2024) whose metallicities are derived by strong-line
methods. The CEERS, ERO and GLASS samples are from Nakajima
et al. (2023), where the metallicities of most galaxies are measured
using strong-line methods, while others are determined by direct T,
method. We excluded samples with AGN features.

We summarize the galaxies detected by both ALMA and JWST
in Table B1. For the mass plotted in Fig. 8, (1) if there are estimates
of underlying old stellar mass in the literature, we plot the mass
of young populations in the left panel, and the total mass (including
potential old populations) in the right panel; (2) if there are consistent
results from different SFHs or SED fitting codes, or there are results
from only one SED fitting procedure, we use the fiducial values from
the corresponding literature in both panels. Similarly, in Fig. 9, (1)
we plot both young and total mass. The total mass is enclosed in a
rectangle, and the two masses are connected by a black dashed line;
(2) we plot the fiducial mass values.

Figure Al. SFHs derived from the posterior output samples of SED fittings using BAGPIPES with different assumptions of SFH models. The non-parametric
model from Leja et al. (2019) assembled in BAGPIPES has a continuity prior. The bottom right panel demonstrates reconstructed SFH where the earliest age
bin is set at 20 Myr, while the bottom left panel assumes a starting point at z = 20. The blue lines and gray shaded regions represent the SOth and 16th-84th
percentiles of posterior output samples. We define onset of SF as the point when SFR exceeds 0.1 per cent of the peak SFR. The grey dashed lines indicate 0.1

per cent of the median peak SFR.
