    "abstract": "Mechanism of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) remains one of the central problems in strongly correlated topological systems. The most intriguing question is about the nature of the normal state: is the Cooper pair formed from small Fermi surface or large Fermi surface? In this work we point out the possibility of a symmetric pseudogap metal with small hole pockets, dubbed as second Fermi liquid (sFL). In the sFL phase at $ν=-2-x$, there is a two-component picture: two electrons mainly localize on the AA sites and form a paired singlet due to anti-Hund's coupling mediated by the optical phonon, while additional holes form small Fermi surfaces. The sFL phase corresponds to an intrinsically strongly interacting fixed point and violates the perturbative Luttinger theorem. We develop a unified framework to describe both a renormalized Fermi liquid (FL) and an sFL phase. We propose that the normal state of the TBG superconductor is the sFL phase, but it evolves toward the FL phase under increasing hole doping. The superconducting phase emerges from the sFL phase by transferring pairing of local moments to the mobile carriers. Interestingly, the superconducting gap can exhibit a nematic nodal $p_x$-pairing symmetry. This work provides, to our knowledge, the first unified theory that explains both the pseudogap metal above $T_c$ and the two-gap nematic superconductivity below it.",

    "abstract": "Spin polarons are bound states of electrons and spin-flips that form above spin polarized electronic insulators.These bound states conventionally form in one of two settings: in frustrated lattices with dispersive bands -- where the motion of an electron preferences binding a nearby spin-flip -- or in topological flat bands -- where the Chern number enforces an effective dipolar interaction between electrons and spin flips. In this work, we report the formation of a spin polaron in a context that doesn't fall cleanly into either of these paradigms. In particular, we study the one-dimensional Mielke-Tasaki chain, a paradigmatic model of flat band ferromagnetism, which has an exact ferromagnetic ground state, trivial band topology, and quenched kinetic energy in its lowest band. Despite these features, our density matrix renormalization group simulations reveal the presence of spin polarons upon electron doping this model. More surprisingly, combining these numerics with analytic calculations, we show that polaron binding occurs when the interaction-induced kinetic energy of the model is zero -- contrary to intuition from kinetic magnetism -- and the glue binding the electrons and spin-flips arises from weak mixing with the model's dispersive band -- contrary to what occurs in topological flat bands. Our results open the doors to exploring how the quantum geometry of flat bands drives the formation of exotic charge carriers.",

For reflection-based readout, we leverage the spin-dependent cavity reflection contrast to generate the qubit readout signal. We show that the cavity reflection approach enables high-fidelity spin readout even when the T center only has a modest cyclicity. With realistic system parameters, such as cavity quality factor $Q = 2\\times10^5$ and T center optical linewidth $Γ/2π= 100$ MHz, we calculate a single-shot readout fidelity exceeding 99% within 8.7 $μ$s for both spin readout protocols.",

    "abstract": "We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens. Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for near-perfect prediction grows as $\\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \\geq 2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously groups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters, revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.",

    "abstract": "The 21-cm signal from the epoch of cosmic dawn ($z \\sim 10-30$) offers a powerful probe of new physics. One standard mechanism for constraining decaying dark matter from 21-cm observations relies on heating of the intergalactic medium by the decay products, an effect whose observability is entangled with the uncertain Lyman-$α$ fluxes and X-ray heating from the first stars. In this Letter, we explore a novel mechanism, where the Lyman-$α$ photons produced from dark matter decay initiate early Wouthuysen-Field coupling of the spin temperature to the gas temperature, thereby boosting the 21-cm signal. This mechanism provides constraints on dark matter that are less dependent on uncertainties associated with star formation than constraints on exotic heating. We study this effect for decaying dark matter with masses $m_χ\\sim20.4-27.2$ eV, where diphoton decay efficiently produces Lyman-series photons. We present forecasts for the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array and the Square Kilometre Array, showing their potential to probe an unconstrained parameter space for light decaying DM, including axion-like particles.",

We establish a general theoretical formulation that yields lower bounds on the optimal sampling overhead and present a constructive protocol demonstrating that a single shared Bell pair can reduce the overhead to the asymptotic limit of standard circuit knitting without requiring classical communication.

Such information is now being measured for dozens of planets with state-of-the-art facilities using Bayesian atmosphere retrievals. We collect measurements of exoplanet composition of gas giants into a Library of Exoplanet Atmospheric Composition Measurements for comparison on a population level. We develop an open-source toolkit, ExoComp, to standardize between solar abundance, metallicity, and C/O ratio definitions. We find a systematic enhancement in the metallicity of exoplanets compared to T-dwarf and stellar populations, a strict bound in C/O between 0 and 1, and statistically significant differences between measurements from direct, eclipse, and transmission spectroscopy. In particular, the transit spectroscopy population exhibits a systematically lower C/O ratio compared to planets observed with eclipse and direct spectroscopy. While such differences may be astrophysical signals, we discuss many of the challenges and subtleties of such a comparison. We characterize the mass-metallicity trend, finding a slope consistent between planets measured in transit versus eclipse, but offset in metallicity. Compared to the Solar System and constraints from interior modeling, gas giant atmospheres appear to exhibit a steeper mass-metallicity trend. We hope that the tools available in ExoComp and the data in the Library of Exoplanet Atmospheric Composition Measurements can enhance the science return of the wide-array of space- and ground-based exoplanet science being undertaken by the community.",

The initial condition for the BK equation can be fitted to the experimental data, which requires evolving the dipole amplitude for a large set of different parameter values. In this work, we train a transformer model to learn the energy dependence of the dipole amplitude, skipping the time-consuming numerical evaluation of the BK equation. The transformer predicts the learned dipole amplitude and the leading order inclusive deep inelastic scattering cross section very accurately, allowing for efficient fitting of the initial condition to the experimental data. Using this setup, we fit the initial condition of the BK equation to the inclusive deep inelastic scattering data from HERA and consider two different starting points $x_0$ for the evolution. We find better agreement with the experimental data for a smaller $x_0$. This work paves the way for future studies involving global fits of the dipole amplitude at leading order and beyond.",

By fitting up to three three epochs per source with a fully relativistic disk model, we show that many system properties can be reliably recovered, including importantly the black hole mass ($M_{\\bullet}$). These accretion-based $M_{\\bullet}$ values, which in this sample span nearly three orders of magnitude, are consistent with galactic scaling relations but are significantly more precise (68\\% credible interval $ < \\pm 0.3$ dex) and physically motivated.

Furthermore, the framework maintains compatibility with standard Monte Carlo event generators for parton showering and hadronisation.

By applying the Gouy-Stodola theorem, we establish a consistent thermodynamic formulation for charged black holes, showing that the first law of thermodynamics remains valid in this context. Furthermore, we explore the behavior of the partition function from the perspective of a distant observer, revealing that charge effects diminish with increasing distance.

The resulting dynamics are analyzed within a space- and time-dependent nonperturbative model capturing both amplitude and phase dynamics. At low fluence, photo-induced suppression of superconductivity results in a nonthermal enhancement of charge order, underscoring the dynamic competition between charge order and superconductivity. With increasing fluence, the slowing down of melting and recovery dynamics is observed, indicating a critical role of phase fluctuations. At high fluence, both charge order and superconductivity remain suppressed for an extended time window due to decoupling between amplitude and phase dynamics and the delayed recovery of phase coherence.

We analyze the performance of these witnesses under realistic noise conditions and finite measurement resolution, showing their robustness to experimental imperfections.

Building on the ETH matrix ansatz and the structure of the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), we show that the chaos bound directly constrains the error of an approximate quantum error-correcting code. This establishes a quantitative relation between information scrambling, thermalization, and correctability. Furthermore, we derive bounds on dynamical fluctuations around the infinite-time average and on fluctuation-dissipation relations, expressed in terms of both the code error and the Lyapunov exponent. Our results reveal how the limits of quantum chaos constrain information preservation in thermalizing quantum systems.",

An approach is presented where the molecular orbitals are variationally optimized for the excited state using a plane wave basis set in Hartree-Fock calculations, followed by configuration interaction calculations on the resulting reference. Using excited state optimized plane wave orbitals greatly enhances the convergence of the many-body calculation, as illustrated by a full configuration interaction calculation of the 2s Rydberg state of H$_2$. A neural-network-based selective configuration interaction approach is then applied to calculations of the 3s, 3p$_x$ and 3p$_y$ states of H$_2$O and the 3s and 3p$_z$ states of NH$_3$. The obtained values of excitation energy are in close agreement with experimental measurements as well as previous many-body calculations based on sufficiently diffuse atomic basis sets. Previously reported high-level calculations limited to atomic basis sets lacking extra diffuse functions, such as aug-cc-pVTZ, give significantly higher estimates due to confinement of the Rydberg states.",

In order to extract properties such as temperature from an XRTS spectrum, the broadening by the SIF needs to be removed. Recent work [Dornheim et al. Nature Commun. 13, 7911 (2022)] has suggested that the SIF may be deconvolved using the two-sided Laplace transform. However, the extracted information can depend strongly on the shape of the input SIF, and the SIF is in practice challenging to measure accurately. Here, we propose an alternative approach: we demonstrate that considering ratios of Laplace-transformed XRTS spectra collected at different scattering angles is equivalent to performing the deconvolution, but without the need for explicit knowledge of the SIF. From these ratios, it is possible to directly extract the temperature from the scattering spectra, when the system is in thermal equilibrium. We find the method to be generally robust to spectral noise and physical differences between the spectrometers, and we explore situations in which the method breaks down. Furthermore, the fact that consistent temperatures can be extracted for systems in thermal equilibrium indicates that non-equilibrium effects could be identified by inconsistent temperatures of a few eV between the ratios of three or more scattering angles.",

In this work, we investigate phase noise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations in the atoms' transverse motion in the presence of the wavefront curvature of the interferometer beam, and analyse its dependence on the laser-beam geometry in long-baseline, large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers. We use a semi-classical framework to derive analytical expressions for the effective phase perturbation in position-averaged measurements and validate them using Monte Carlo simulations. Applied to 100-m and 1-km atom gradiometers representative of next-generation experiments, the model shows that configurations maximizing pulse efficiency also amplify curvature-induced phase noise, requiring micron-level control of the atom cloud's centre-of-mass position and sub-micron-per-second control of its centre-of-mass velocity to achieve sub-$10^{-5}$ rad phase stability. Alternative beam geometries can suppress this noise by up to two orders of magnitude, but at the cost of reduced pulse efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a mitigation strategy based on position-resolved phase-shift readout, which empirically learns and corrects the wavefront-induced bias from measurable quantities such as the phase-shift gradient and final cloud position. This approach restores high-sensitivity operation in the maximum-pulse-efficiency configuration without detailed beam characterisation, providing a practical route towards next-generation, time-resolved atom interferometers operating at the $10^{-5}$ rad noise level.",

The resulting ratios, computed with a relatively small number of configurations, are consistent with phenomenological expectations for the pion's valence distribution, with statistical uncertainties that are competitive with modern global fits. These findings demonstrate that the gradient flow provides an efficient and systematically improvable method to access partonic quantities from first principles.

The method utilizes counterdiabatic protocols, which suppress non-adiabatic transitions, with an iterative bias-field procedure that progressively steers the sampling toward low-energy regions. We observe that the samples obtained at each iteration correspond to approximate Boltzmann distributions at effective temperatures. By aggregating these samples and applying classical reweighting, the method reconstructs the Boltzmann distribution at a desired temperature. We define a scalable performance metric, based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the total variation distance, to quantify convergence toward the exact Boltzmann distribution. DCQS is validated on one-dimensional Ising models with random couplings up to 124 qubits, where exact results are available through transfer-matrix methods. We then apply it to a higher-order spin-glass Hamiltonian with 156 qubits executed on IBM quantum processors. We show that classical sampling algorithms, including Metropolis-Hastings and the state-of-the-art low-temperature technique parallel tempering, require up to three orders of magnitude more samples to match the quality of DCQS, corresponding to an approximately 2x runtime advantage. Boltzmann sampling underlies applications ranging from statistical physics to machine learning, yet classical algorithms exhibit exponentially slow convergence at low temperatures. Our results thus demonstrate a robust route toward scalable and efficient Boltzmann sampling on current quantum processors.",

This study investigates the effects of controlled atomic hydrogen exposure on young and mature soot nanoparticles, generated in premixed ethylene-air flames, and deposited on substrates. We employed a multi-technique approach to characterize the chemical, mechanical, and electrical evolution of the films. In-situ infrared spectroscopy revealed non-monotonic behavior: an initial increase in aliphatic CH bonds was observed, followed by a decrease at higher hydrogen fluences. This was accompanied by a continuous decrease in the aromatic C=C signal. Atomic force microscopy showed a significant increase in the Young's modulus of the film for both sample types after hydrogenation. This mechanical change was correlated with an increase in the I(D)/I(G) ratio from Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, both macroscopic current vs. voltage and local scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements demonstrated a notable increase in electrical conductivity. For single just-formed soot particles, moreover, a hydrogen-induced transformation from a semiconductive to a semi-metallic nature was observed. The collective evidence points towards an H-induced CC cross-linking mechanism within the nanoparticle films. We propose that atomic hydrogen facilitates the formation of radical sites, which promotes covalent bond formation between adjacent particles or molecular units, creating a more interconnected and rigid network, with smaller interlayer distance.

Here, we present data from the first two seasons targeting the Shapley Supercluster (0.02<z<0.06), which is responsible for a large but unknown fraction of our local group's motion. Until now, no supernovae had been analyzed in the direction of Shapley. Through the WHALES survey, we have identified 12 likely SNe Ia in this region using SkyMapper, including 8 with spectroscopic confirmation. We present the first light curves of these SNe and combine our observations with data from ATLAS. We demonstrate that the low number of discovered SNe Ia per season is consistent with various rate calculations, highlighting the need for future surveys to monitor superclusters over a multi-year timespan. Finally, we present simulations of SN Ia observations in the environments of massive galaxy clusters, demonstrating how the inferred peculiar velocities can constrain cluster masses, and highlighting the added complexity within superclusters.

First, an equivalence between Klyachko-Can-Binicioğlu-Shumovsky (KCBS) vectors and the Pyramid UPB is shown and then by constructing a one parameter family of UPB vectors, a quantitative connection between `contextuality strength' and bound entanglement of states associated with the corresponding UPB is demonstrated. This equivalence is extended to generalized KCBS vectors and the GenPyramid UPB. A new class of minimal UPBs in $\\mathbb{C}^3 \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^n$ is constructed using Lovász-optimal orthogonal representations (LOORs) of cycle graphs and their complements which we term the GenContextual UPB. Any minimal UPB in this dimension is shown to be graph-equivalent to the GenContextual UPB. We briefly discuss the distinguishability properties of GenContextual UPB. In the reverse direction, we observe that the constituent vectors of the QuadRes UPB are LOORs of Paley graphs.

The cost function was designed to achieve a net energy saving by simultaneously minimizing aerodynamic drag and penalizing the actuation's energy consumption.

The optimal control law features a strong, low-frequency actuation from the bottom jet, which targets the main vortex shedding, while the top and lateral jets address higher-frequency, less energetic phenomena. Particle Image Velocimetry analysis reveals a significant upward shift and stabilization of the wake, leading to substantial pressure recovery on the model's lower base. Ultimately, this work demonstrates that a model-free optimization approach can successfully identify non-intuitive, multi-faceted actuation strategies that yield significant and energetically efficient drag reduction.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the connection between accretion signatures and host galaxy properties in the context of how active dwarf galaxies are identified. We use the database constructed in Wasleske & Baldassare (2024) which contains dwarf galaxies that were selected as active galaxies by optical spectroscopy, infrared colors, X-ray brightness, and photometric variability. Multi-wavelength archival data was used to consistently apply all of these methods to every galaxy within this compiled set. The cross application of these methods resulted in a diversity of sub-populations identified as active by some set of these techniques. In this paper, we estimate host galaxy properties from spectral energy distribution models. We connect the active galactic nuclei (AGN) signatures to our estimated host galaxies' properties using statistical dimensionality reduction methods. We find that dwarf AGN selected by infrared colors are the most distinct population, with the highest star formation rates and lowest stellar masses. We also find some other key population differences, such as the broad line AGN having significantly higher AGN luminosities. X-ray and variability selected AGN have higher average star formation rates than those selected with optical narrow line spectroscopic diagrams. Our connections to the host galaxy parameters potentially point to the sub-populations representing different epochs of the evolution of accretion.",

We investigate this competition on a two-leg ladder model with a p-wave-like hybridisation between the legs. This model hosts a symmetry-protected topological phase in its non-interacting limit. Using the density-matrix renormalisation group algorithm, we compute the comprehensive quantum phase diagram in the presence of a repulsive inter-leg density-density interaction. Our analysis, based on entanglement entropy and the entanglement spectrum, reveals a fascinating dichotomy in the stability of the topological phase. We find a non-trivial change in the value of the edge entanglement entropy as we include interaction. Furthermore, we find that the phase boundary separating a trivial insulator phase and a topological one with winding number two remains robustly pinned at its non-interacting location, irrespective of the interaction strength. Variation of the effective conformal field theory's central charge near the critical line explains the robustness of the gap. In contrast, the transition to an insulating phase with winding number one is heavily renormalised, with the critical line shifting significantly as the interaction increases. By successfully mapping the phase diagram and identifying the distinct behaviours of the phase boundaries, our work clarifies how interactions can selectively preserve or destroy different aspects of a topological phase.",

    "abstract": "Rayleigh-Benard convection (RBC) is a canonical system for buoyancy-driven turbulence and heat transport, central to geophysical and industrial flows. Developing efficient control strategies remains challenging at high Rayleigh numbers, where fully resolved simulations are computationally expensive. We use a control framework that couples data-driven manifold dynamics (DManD) with reinforcement learning (RL) to suppress convective heat transfer. We find a coordinate transformation to a low-dimensional system using POD and autoencoders, and then learn an evolution equation for this low-dimensional state using neural ODEs. The reduced model reproduces key system features while enabling rapid policy training. Policies trained in the DManD environment and deployed in DNS achieve a 16-23 % reduction in the Nusselt number for both single- and dual-boundary actuation. Physically, the learned strategy modulates near-wall heat flux to stabilize and thicken the thermal boundary layer, weaken plume ejection, and damp the wall-driven instabilities that seed convective bursts. Crucially, the controller drives the flow toward a quasi-steady state characterized by suppressed temporal fluctuations and spatially steady heat-flux patterns. This work establishes DManD-RL as a physically interpretable, scalable approach for turbulence control in high-dimensional flows.",

We show that radiative corrections modify the leading-order ratio of these spectra by $5\\%$ with minimal energy dependence, a result relevant for enhancing the discovery reach of upcoming experiments.

The emergence of ferroelectric order in incipient ferroelectrics is a topic of considerable interest from both fundamental and applied perspectives. Among the various strategies explored, strain engineering has been proven to be a powerful method for tuning ferroelectric polarization in materials. In the case of KTaO3, first principles calculations have suggested that strain can drive a ferroelectric phase transition. In this study, we investigate the impact of in-plane uniaxial and biaxial strain, ranging from 0% to 1%, on pristine KTaO3 to explore its potential for ferroelectricity induction via inversion symmetry breaking. By integrating density functional theory calculations with the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation assisted by on the fly machine learned force field, we obtain accurate structural information and dynamical properties under varying strain conditions while incorporating higher-order anharmonic effects. Employing the Berry phase method, we obtained the ferroelectric polarization of the strained structures over the entire temperature range up to 300 K. Our findings provide valuable insights into the role of strain in stabilizing ferroelectricity in KTaO3, offering guidance for future experimental and theoretical studies on strain-engineered ferroelectric materials.",

The search space of gate sequences grows combinatorially, and handcrafted templates often waste scarce qubit and depth budgets. We introduce \\textsc{FlowQ-Net} (Flow-based Quantum design Network), a generative framework for automated quantum circuit synthesis based on Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets). This framework learns a stochastic policy to construct circuits sequentially, sampling them in proportion to a flexible, user-defined reward function that can encode multiple design objectives such as performance, depth, and gate count. This approach uniquely enables the generation of a diverse ensemble of high-quality circuits, moving beyond single-solution optimization. We demonstrate the efficacy of \\textsc{FlowQ-Net} through an extensive set of simulations. We apply our method to Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) ansatz design for molecular ground state estimation, Max-Cut, and image classification, key challenges in near-term quantum computing. Circuits designed by \\textsc{FlowQ-Net} achieve significant improvements, yielding circuits that are 10$\\times$-30$\\times$ more compact in terms of parameters, gates, and depth compared to commonly used unitary baselines, without compromising accuracy. This trend holds even when subjected to error profiles from real-world quantum devices. Our results underline the potential of generative models as a general-purpose methodology for automated quantum circuit design, offering a promising path towards more efficient quantum algorithms and accelerating scientific discovery in the quantum domain.",

Applying consensus clustering with a hierarchical density-based clustering algorithm, we demonstrate that the detected spatial dependencies are stable against perturbations by measurement uncertainties. The $i_{\\rm mag}$ correlation scales are on the order of ~3 pc, which aligns with the typical scales of the Lupus molecular cloud filaments. Our results reveal a connection between large-scale forces -- in the form of expanding shells from the Upper Scorpius and Upper-Centaurus-Lupus regions -- and sub-au scale system configurations. We find that Lupus has a non-uniform $i_{\\rm mag}$ distribution and suggest that this results from the preferential elongation of protostellar cores along filamentary axes. Non-uniformity would have significant implications for exoplanet occurrence rate calculations, so future work should explore the longevity of these biases driven by the star-cloud connection.",

We first employ a phenomenological field theory to qualitatively determine the phase diagram. Furthermore, we generalize a previously established alternating pattern of superconductor and tunneling regions, coupled to fractional quantum Hall edge states, to map the problem onto a topological Josephson junction chain involving lattice parafermions. Using density matrix renormalization group simulations, we establish a phase diagram composed of Mott insulating phases and two different Luttinger liquids whose fundamental excitations carry charges 2e and $2e/3$, respectively. In agreement with analytical considerations using conformal field theory, we numerically find transitions of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type as well as a continuous $\\mathbb Z_3 \\times U(1)$ second-order phase transition characterized by central charge c = 9/5.

The light curve properties of the first burst and spectra of the second burst are consistent with a dwarf nova. Its fast evolving behaviour makes it one of the fastest and faintest dwarf novae observed. The estimated distance of AT2022kak from the Galactic centre is ~6.6 kpc, with a scale height of ~2 kpc.

We propose a scaling of the model's parameters with the cylinder circumference that simultaneously approaches the continuum and thermodynamic limits. We find that different scaling schemes yield distinct topological signatures: we either retrieve a spontaneous formation of charge density wave ordering reminiscent of the Tao-Thouless states, known from the continuum problem on thin cylinders, or we find uniform states with a topological degeneracy that can be identified as minimally entangled states known from studies of chiral spin liquids on cylinders.

Approximations of the equations have been proposed and used in geophysical exploration, however, full use of the equations and their generalization to multiple layers could offer richer information about the properties of the media and be helpful in medical diagnosis via ultrasound. In this work, we investigate how to extract information from the angle-dependent reflection coefficients, including critical angles and the wave distortion at the interface between two and three media. It is shown that it is possible to separate the effect of density from speed of sound mismatch by measuring amplitudes as a function of angle of incidence (AVA). And examining the critical angle and waveform distortion of the reflected waves can reveal the thickness of an intermediate layer, even with subwavelength resolution. These studies could be integrated into medical imaging and also into the training of artificial intelligence systems that assist in diagnosis.

Specifically, the CME was relatively slow (~600 km/s) and the accompanying interplanetary type-II/III radio bursts were faint and short-duration, unlike those typically detected during large events. In particular, the type-II emission did not extend to kHz frequencies and disappeared ~5.5 hours prior to the LDGRF end time. Furthermore, the associated solar energetic particle (SEP) event was very weak, short-duration, and limited to a few tens of MeV, even at magnetically well-connected spacecraft. These findings demonstrate that a very-fast CME resulting in a high-energy SEP event is not a necessary condition for the occurrence of LDGRFs, challenging the idea that the high-energy $γ$-ray emission is produced by the back-precipitation of shock-accelerated ions into the solar surface. The alternative origin scenario based on local particle trapping and acceleration in large-scale coronal loops is instead favored by the observation of giant arch-like structures of hot plasma over the source region persisting for the entire duration of this LDGRF.",

In this work, we systematically assess the performance of pDFXM relative to monochromatic DFXM when using a compound refractive lens (CRL) as the objective. Analytical expressions for the spatial and angular resolution are derived and compared with numerical simulations based on geometrical optics and experimental data. The pink-beam configuration provides an increased diffraction intensity depending on the deformation state of the sample, accompanied by a general tenfold degradation in angular resolution along the rocking and longitudinal directions. This trade-off is disadvantageous for axial strain mapping, but can be advantageous in cases where integrated intensities are needed. For a perfect crystal under parallel illumination with a pink beam, our results show that chromatic aberration is absent, whereas under condensed illumination it becomes significant. The aberration is shown to depend strongly on the local distortion of the crystal. Weak-beam imaging conditions, such as those required for resolving dislocations, are shown to remain feasible under pink-beam operation and may even provide an improved signal-to-noise ratio. The higher incident flux, enhanced by nearly two orders of magnitude, is quantified in terms of beam heating effects, and implications for optimized scanning protocols are discussed.",

    "abstract": "In a tidal disruption event (TDE), a star is disrupted by the tidal field of a massive black hole, creating a debris stream that returns to the black hole, forms an accretion flow, and powers a luminous flare. Over the last few decades, several numerical studies have concluded that shock-induced dissipation occurs as the stream returns to pericentre (i.e., pre-self-intersection), resulting in efficient circularisation of the debris. However, the efficacy of these shocks is the subject of intense debate. We present high-resolution simulations (up to 10^10 particles) of the disruption of a solar-like star by a 10^6M_sun black hole with the new, GPU-based, smoothed-particle hydrodynamics code SPH-EXA, including the relativistic apsidal precession of the stellar debris orbits; our simulations run from initial disruption to the moment of stream self-intersection. With 10^8 particles - corresponding to the highest-resolution SPH simulations of TDEs in the pre-existing literature - we find significant, in-plane spreading of the debris as the stream returns through pericenter, in line with previous works that suggested this is a significant source of dissipation and luminous emission. However, with increasing resolution this effect is dramatically diminished, and with 10^10 particles there is effectively no change between the incoming and the outgoing stream widths. Our results demonstrate that the paradigm of significant dissipation of kinetic energy during pericentre passage is incorrect, and instead it is likely that debris circularisation is mediated by the originally proposed, stream-stream collision scenario.",

For example, orbital hybridisation and charge transfer at a vdW interface may result in electric fields across the interface that give rise to Rashba spin-orbit coupling. In magnetic vdW heterostructures, this in turn can drive the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction which leads to a canting of local magnetic moments at the vdW interface and may thus stabilise novel 2D magnetic phases. While such emergent magnetic \"interphases\" offer a promising platform for spin-based electronics, direct spectroscopic evidence for them is still lacking. Here, we report Zeeman effects with Landé $g$-factors up to $\\approx230$ at the interface of graphene and the vdW ferromagnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. They arise from a magnetic interphase in which local-moment canting and itinerant orbital moments generated by the non-trivial band topology of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ conspire to cause a giant asymmetric level splitting when a magnetic field is applied. Exploiting the inelastic phonon gap of graphene, we can directly access the buried vdW interface to the Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy. Systematically analyzing the Faraday-like screening of the tip electric field by the graphene, we demonstrate the tunability of the constitutional interface dipole, as well as the Zeeman effect, by tip gating.

The enzyme we choose to use as the active driver is urease, an enzyme that has been shown by several groups to exhibit enhanced diffusion in the presence of its substrate. The non-interacting LLPS protein is ubiquilin-2, a protein that condenses with increasing temperature and salt. Using a microfluidic device with semipermeable membranes, we create a chemostatic environment to maintain the substrate content to feed the enzymatic bath and remove the products of the chemical reaction. Thus, we isolate the physical enhanced fluctuations from the chemical changes of the enzyme activity. We also compare the results to controls without activity or in the presence of the products of the reaction. We find that the active bath is able to enhance droplet size, density, and concentration, implying that more ubiquilin-2 is in condensed form. This result is consistent with an interpretation that the active bath acts as an effective temperature. Simulations provide an underlying interpretation for our experimental results. Together, these findings provide the first demonstration that physical enzymatic activity can act as an effective temperature to modify LLPS behavior, with implications for intracellular organization in the enzymatically active cellular environment.",

While optical flow, a computer vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images, has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion, which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations, offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.",

However, they can be computationally demanding in wall-clock time, especially for large systems, which limits the time and length scales accessible. Coarse-grained (CG) models reduce computational expense by grouping atoms into simplified representations commonly termed beads, but sacrifice atomic detail and introduce mapping noise, complicating the training of machine-learned surrogates. Moreover, because CG models inherently include entropic contributions, they cannot be fit directly to all-atom energies, leaving instantaneous, noisy forces as the only state-specific quantities available for training. Here, we apply a knowledge distillation framework by first training an initial CG neural network potential (the teacher) solely on CG-mapped forces to denoise those labels, then distill its force and energy predictions to train refined CG models (the student) in both single- and ensemble-training setups while exploring different force and energy target combinations. We validate this framework on a complex molecular fluid - a deep eutectic solvent - by evaluating two-, three-, and many-body properties and compare the CG and all-atom results. Our findings demonstrate that training a student model on ensemble teacher-predicted forces and per-bead energies improves the quality and stability of CG force fields.",

We propose a new nonlocal model which can recover the kinetic effects for heat conduction and magnetic field in hydrodynamic scale simultaneously. We clarify the necessity of self-consistently considering the electric field corrections in nonlocal models to get reasonable physical quantities. Using the new nonlocal model, the nonlocal corrections of transport coefficients in magnetized plasma and the magnetic field generation without density gradients are systematically studied.

We examine the conditions under which the additional longitudinal mode is eliminated so that only two DOFs remain. To this end, we perform a Hamiltonian constraint analysis and identify two necessary and sufficient degeneracy conditions that reduce the number of DOFs from three to two. We find three classes of solutions satisfying these degeneracy conditions, corresponding to distinct types of theories. Type-I theories possess one first-class and two second-class constraints, type-II theories have four second-class constraints, and type-III theories contain two first-class constraints.

However, their atomic thinness renders them susceptible to damage during nanoscale fabrication. Focused ion beam technology, while offering precise defect engineering for tailoring optoelectronic properties, often induces collateral damage far beyond the target region, compromising device performance. This study addresses the critical challenge of preserving the intrinsic optical characteristics of 2D TMDCs during FIB patterning. We demonstrate that conventional dielectric encapsulation fails to protect 2D TMDCs from gallium ion-induced damage, leading to persistent defects and quenched optical responses in patterned microstructures. In contrast, polymeric encapsulation with PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) effectively mitigates damage by acting as a sacrificial layer that absorbs ion impact, thereby preserving the optical properties of the underlying TMDC. Furthermore, we leverage XeF2-assisted Ga ion beam direct patterning, which significantly reduces collateral damage, minimizes Ga ion implantation, and enables precise anisotropic material removal, yielding ultra-smooth sidewalls critical for high-quality photonic resonators. This combined approach of PMMA encapsulation and XeF2-assisted FIB patterning offers a robust, cost-effective, and scalable single-step fabrication route for integrating 2D TMDCs into high-performance photonic devices, thereby maintaining their intrinsic optical functionality essential for advancing quantum technologies and compact optical circuits.",

We identify several previously unknown stoichiometric compounds that are both thermodynamically and vibrationally stable at sub-terapascal pressures, within the reach of modern high-pressure experiments. In particular, AHe$_{2}$ and AHe (A: Ar, Kr, Xe) adopt previously unreported orthorhombic, hexagonal and cubic phases that remain stable over wide pressure ranges. We further find that He-Xe systems host metallic and excitonic insulator phases at pressures nearly an order of magnitude lower than those required for pure helium, offering a pathway to realize these exotic quantum states experimentally. Finite-temperature simulations also reveal superionic He-Xe phases, in which helium ions diffuse either anisotropically or isotropically depending on the host lattice. These findings constitute the first prediction of helium-based systems that combine metallicity and superionicity, with profound implications for energy transport and planetary dynamo processes. Overall, our results demonstrate that mixing helium with heavier rare gases provides an effective strategy to stabilize metallic, excitonic insulator, and superionic phases at experimentally accessible pressures, opening new research directions for condensed matter physics and planetary science.",

We compare Eu abundances with those of Mg and Ba to evaluate the efficiency of the r-process relative to $α$-capture and s-process nucleosynthesis. The SMC shows enhanced [Eu/Fe] values at all metallicities (comparable with the values measured in the Milky Way), with a clear decline as [Fe/H] increases (from $\\sim$ -1.75 dex to $\\sim$ -0.5 dex), consistent with the onset of Type Ia supernovae.

    "abstract": "We characterize various dynamical phases of the simplest version of the quantum kicked-top model, a paradigmatic system for studying quantum chaos. This system exhibits both regular and chaotic behavior depending on the kick strength. The existence of the $2$-DTC phase has previously been reported around the rotationally symmetric point of the system, where it displays regular dynamics. We show that the system hosts robust $2$-DTC and dynamical freezing (DF) phases around alternating rotationally symmetric points. Interestingly, we also identify $4$-DTC phases that cannot be explained by the system's $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry; these phases become stable for higher values of angular momentum. We explain the emergence of higher-order DTC phases through classical phase portraits of the system, connected with spin coherent states (SCSs). The $4$-DTC phases appear for certain initial states that are close to the spiral saddle points identified in the classical picture. Moreover, the linear entropy decreases as the angular momentum increases, indicating enhanced stability of the $4$-DTC phases. We also find an emergent conservation law for both the $2$-DTC and DF phases, while dynamical conservation arises periodically for the $4$-DTC phases.",

This geometry, corresponding to a hyperbolic slicing of dS$_3\\times\\mathbb{R}$, complements previous analyses of attractors in Bjorken (flat slicing) and Gubser (spherical slicing) flows. The fluid behaves like a sharply localized droplet propagating rapidly along the lightcone, reminiscent of wounded nuclei in the CGC picture. Typical solutions approach the hydrodynamic attractor rapidly at late times despite a Knudsen number exceeding unity, suggesting that the inverse Reynolds number captures hydrodynamization more faithfully since the shear stress vanishes at late times. This is in stark contrast to Gubser flow, which has both the Knudsen and inverse Reynolds number becoming small for intermediate times. We close with a comparison to Weyl-transformed Bjorken flow and discuss possible phenomenological applications.",

The low-frequency data, particularly in band 3, is highly sensitive to propagation effects such as dispersion measure (DM) fluctuations, which can be imprints of some astrophysical phenomena (scientific outliers). Here, we analyze the two outliers of possible astrophysical origin coming from the band 3 DM time series of two pulsars: PSR J1022+1001, with an ecliptic latitude of -0.06 degree , and PSR J2145-0750, one of the brightest MSPs, with multi-component profile morphology. Our study reveals compelling evidence for a coronal mass ejection (CME) event traced in the data of PSR J1022+1001, and reports evidence for a potential mode-changing event in PSR J2145-0750. Extending the analyses presented here to the full sample of InPTA-DR2 pulsars is expected to reveal additional CME events, and possible mode-changing events. Such detections will not only improve our understanding of solar and pulsar magnetospheric plasma interactions but will also enable more accurate modelling of DM variations, leading to improved pulsar timing solutions, which are crucial for high-precision Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) science.",

We demonstrate that our method improves upon alternative approaches, such as an Enthalpy Gradient Descent baseline, both at the field and summary-statistic level. The approach is furthermore highly data efficient, with a single reference simulation of cosmological structure formation being sufficient to constrain the neural pressure model.

Unfortunately, the original formulation of instanton theory fundamentally breaks down when trying to calculate the level splitting in asymmetric double wells, as there is no imaginary-time periodic orbit connecting the two non-degenerate minima. We have therefore developed a new formulation of instanton theory based on a projected flux correlation function that is applicable to these asymmetric systems. Comparison with exact quantum-mechanical results in one- and two-dimensional models demonstrates that it has a reasonably high accuracy, similar to that reported for instanton theory in the symmetric case. The theory is then applied to study tunneling between non-degenerate minima in the biomolecule $α$-fenchol, for which we find good agreement with experiment. Finally, we use the connection to instanton rate theory, which is also derived from flux correlation functions, to discuss the often misunderstood relationship between tunneling splittings and reaction rate constants.",

The oscillation frequency and damping rate are quantitatively predicted by a simplified hydrodynamic model, in agreement with Bogoliubov-de Gennes analysis and Gross-Pitaevskii simulations. We identify the critical dissipation separating persistent oscillations from overdamped vortex localization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that periodic modulation of the inter-ring barrier at resonant frequencies enables controlled vortex transfer even when the condensates are well separated in density.

We construct gauge-invariant observables localized on a null ray segment that commute with those localized on the complement; thus, the phase space describes a genuine gravitational subsystem compatible with both locality and diffeomorphism invariance. Our construction employs 'dressing time' (a null time coordinate built from spin 0 gravitational degrees of freedom) as a dynamical reference frame. The existence of such a frame depends on the use of edge mode variables, which we argue are generally required to upgrade a local gauge-fixing condition to a global 'frame-fixing'. To analyze the effects of quantum diffeomorphism anomalies on these structures, we then establish an 'effective' classical description in which the Raychaudhuri equation, symplectic form, and edge mode variables all acquire Virasoro-type deformations. Within this framework, we identify three distinct diffeomorphism actions: reparametrizations (gauge transformations), reorientations (physical symmetries of the reference frame), and dressed reparametrizations. Each acquires its own central extension and plays a different crucial role in the effective theory. The resulting structures provide a foundation for quantizing gravitational null ray segments, including promoting dressing time to a genuine quantum reference frame.",

Using the constrained random-phase approximation, we show that the CDW amplitude modifies the bare and screened on-site interactions, leading to sizable variations in the effective Hubbard U. Our combined density functional and dynamical mean-field theory calculations reveal that the Hubbard bands shift in concert with the CDW amplitude, and that a reduced distortion drives a transition from a Mott insulator to a correlated metal. These results demonstrate a direct link between lattice distortions and Coulomb interactions in transition-metal dichalcogenides, providing a microscopic mechanism for light-induced control of correlated phases in two-dimensional quantum materials.",

The magnitude of strain and the associated increase in the density of states can be tuned by varying the film thickness, as systematically confirmed by x-ray diffraction and photoemission spectroscopy measurements. Symmetry analysis further reveals that (100) RuO$_2$ hosts an ideal altermagnetic order, whereas broken symmetry in (110) films leads to an uncompensated ferrimagnetic state.

Dust polarization shows that Arp 220 E has a spiral-like B-field on the disk with a linear polarization fraction of $0.4\\pm0.1$% that may produce the detected circular polarization passing through foreground aligned dust grains. Arp 220 W reveals a B-field parallel to the red- and blueshifted outflows in both the dust and emission line polarization maps. The outflows show a dust polarization of $0.2$%, while the CO(3-2) emission line polarization is $1-2$% at $4-6σ$ significance across independent velocity channels. A highly polarized ($3-5$%) dusty bridge has a B-field orientation of $\\sim110^{\\circ}$ connecting both nuclei. Mean B-field strengths of $1.6$ mG and $8$ mG for the blue- and redshifted outflows, respectively, are estimated.

The goal is to expand the capabilities of HPCQC environments by offering the ability for low-level access and control, currently typically not foreseen for such hybrid systems. For this, we need to establish new interfaces that integrate such pulse-level control into the lower layers of the software stack, including the need for proper representation. Pulse-level quantum programs can be fully described with only three low-level abstractions: ports (input/output channels), frames (reference signals), and waveforms (pulse envelopes). We identify four key challenges to represent those pulse abstractions at: the user-interface level, at the compiler level (including the Intermediate Representation (IR)), and at the backend-interface level (including the appropriate exchange format). For each challenge, we propose concrete solutions in the context of MQSS. These include introducing a compiled (C/C++) pulse Application Programming Interface (API) to overcome Python runtime overhead, extending its LLVM support to include pulse-related instructions, using its C-based backend interface to query relevant hardware constraints, and designing a portable exchange format for pulse sequences. Our integrated approach provides an end-to-end path for pulse-aware compilation and runtime execution in HPCQC environments.

    "abstract": "Background and Purpose: Increasing the number of arcs in volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) allows for better intensity modulation and may improve plan quality. However, this leads to longer delivery times, which may cause patient discomfort and increase intra-fractional motion. In this study, it was investigated whether the delivery of different VMAT plans in different fractions may improve the dosimetric quality and delivery efficiency for the treatment of patients with complex tumor geometries. Materials and Methods: A direct aperture optimization algorithm was developed which allows for the simultaneous optimization of different VMAT plans to be delivered in different fractions, based on their cumulative physical dose. Each VMAT plan is constrained to deliver a uniform dose within the target volume, such that the entire treatment does not alter the fractionation scheme and is robust against inter-fractional setup errors. This approach was evaluated in-silico for ten patients with gynecological and head-and-neck cancer. Results: For all patients, fraction-variant treatments achieved better target coverage and reduced the dose to critical organs-at-risk compared to fraction-invariant treatments that deliver the same plan in every fraction, where the dosimetric benefit was shown to increase with the number of different plans to be delivered. In addition, 1-arc and 2-arc fraction-variant treatments could approximate the dosimetric quality of 3-arc fraction-invariant treatments, while reducing the delivery time from 180 s to 60 s and 120 s, respectively. Conclusions: Fraction-variant VMAT treatments may achieve excellent dosimetric quality for patients with complex tumor geometries, while keeping the delivery time per fraction viable.",

These paradoxes highlight the tension between quantum theory and our intuitions about reality being observer-independent. Building on a recent result that developed these paradoxes into a no-go theorem, namely the Local Friendliness Theorem, we introduce the Causal Friendliness Paradox, a time-ordered analogue of it. In this framework, we replace the usual locality assumption with Axiological Time Symmetry (ATS), and show that, when combined with the assumptions of Absoluteness of Observed Events (AOE), No Retrocausality (NRC), and Screening via Pseudo Events (SPE), we obtain a causal inequality. We then show that quantum mechanics violates this inequality and is therefore incompatible with at least one of these assumptions. To probe which assumption might be incompatible, we then examine whether AOE in its entirety is essential for this no-go result. We propose a weaker, operational form of AOE that still leads to inequalities that quantum mechanics violates. This result shows that even under relaxed assumptions, quantum theory resists reconciliation with classical notions of absolute events, reinforcing the foundational significance of Wigner's Friend-type paradoxes in timelike scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Stars on bound orbits around a supermassive black hole may undergo repeated partial tidal disruption events (rpTDEs), producing periodic flares. While several candidates have been suggested, definitive confirmation of these events remains elusive. We report the discovery of AT2023uqm, a nuclear transient that has exhibited at least five periodic optical flares, making it only the second confirmed case of periodicity after ASASSN-14ko. Uniquely, the flares from AT2023uqm show a nearly exponential increase in energy--a \"runaway\" phenomenon signaling the star's progressive destruction. This behavior is consistent with rpTDEs of low-mass, main-sequence stars or evolved giant stars. Multiwavelength observations and spectroscopic analysis of the two most recent flares reinforce its interpretation as an rpTDE. Intriguingly, each flare displays a similar double-peaked structure, potentially originating from a double-peaked mass fallback rate or two discrete collisions per orbit. The extreme ratio of peak separation to orbital period draws attention to the possibility of a giant star being disrupted, which could be distinguished from a low-mass main-sequence star by its future mass-loss evolution. Our analysis demonstrates the power of rpTDEs to probe the properties of disrupted stars and the physical processes of tidal disruption, though it is currently limited by our knowledge of these events. AT2023uqm emerges as the most compelling rpTDE thus far, serving as a crucial framework for modeling and understanding these phenomena.",

    "abstract": "The use of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation to study the rheology of fluids under shear has always been of great interest to the research community. Despite being a powerful tool, a limitation of DPD is the need to use high shear rates to obtain viscosity results with a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This often leads to simulations with unrealistically large deformations that do not reflect typical stress conditions on the fluid. In this work, the transient time correlation function (TTCF) technique is used for a simple Newtonian DPD fluid to achieve high SNR results even at arbitrarily low shear rates. The applicability of the TTCF on DPD systems is assessed, and the modifications required by the nature of the DPD force field are discussed. The results showed that the standard error (SE) of viscosity values obtained with TTCF is consistently lower than that of the classic averaging procedure across all tested shear rates. Moreover, the SE resulted proportional to the shear rate, leading to a constant SNR that does not decrease at lower shear rates. Additionally, the effect of trajectory mapping on DPD is studied, and a TTCF approach that does not require mappings is consolidated. Remarkably, the absence of mappings has not reduced the precision of the method compared with the more common mapped approach.",

The copolymer's swelling behavior was characterized using dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) and in-situ atomic force microscopy (AFM). DVS measurements demonstrated that the polymer coating significantly enhances the hygroscopic properties of the paper, while AFM revealed the polymer's fast response to relative humidity (RH) changes, shown by immediate height adjustments, increased adhesion, and decreased stiffness at higher RH levels.Studies on polymer-modified paper-based bilayer actuators demonstrate that incorporating the hydrophilic P(DMAA-co-MABP) results in actuation in response to relative humidity variations between 10% and 90% RH. From these findings, two models were proposed to assess key mechanisms in the swelling behavior: the correlation between the heterogeneity in crosslinking and the polymer swelling behavior, and the correlation between polymer-paper interactions and the hygro-responsive bending behavior. Additionally, thermal analysis was performed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), providing a comprehensive profile of the copolymer's behavior.",

The combined code takes into account changes in orbital parameters that define the heliocentric distance as a function of time, which is fed into the thermal/compositional evolution code. The latter includes a set of volatile species, gas flow through the porous interior, crystallization of amorphous ice, sublimation and refreezing of volatiles in the pores. We follow the evolution of three models, with radii of 2, 10 and 50 km for 4.6 Gyr, through different dynamical epochs, starting in the vicinity of Neptune, moving to the Oort Cloud and after a long sojourn there, back inward to the planetary region. The initial composition includes a mixture of CO, CO2 ices, amorphous water ice with trapped CO and CO2, and dust.We find that the CO ice is completely depleted in the small object, but preserved in the larger ones from a depth of 500 m to the center, while the CO2 and the amorphous ice are entirely preserved. Of crucial importance is the change in CO abundance profiles during the cooling phase, as the objects migrate to the OC. Upon return from the Oort Cloud, the activity is driven by CO sublimation at large heliocentric distances (up to 50 au), by CO2 inward of 13 au and by gas released from crystallizing amorphous ice at about 7 au. We test the effect of radioactive heating by long-lived isotopes and find that it is negligible. Considering sub-solar temperatures and limited active areas, we show that CO2 production rates can exceed the detection limit as far out as 25 au.",

Beam pointing stability has been traditionally achieved using simple proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control which removes the problem of slow drift, but is limited because of the time delay in knowing the diagnosis and the inertia in the mechanical system associated with mirrors. In this work, we introduce a predictive control strategy where the forecasting of beam pointing errors is performed by a patch-based multilayer perceptron (Patch-MLP) designed to capture local temporal patterns for more robust short-term jitter prediction. The subsequent conversion of these predicted errors into correction signals is handled by a PID controller. The neural network has been trained on diagnostic time-series data to predict beam pointing error. Using the feed-forward controller compensates for system delays. Simulations with a correction mirror placed upstream of the PHELIX pre-amplifier bridge confirm that the predictive control scheme reduces residual jitter compared to conventional PID control. Over a 10-hour dataset the controller maintained stable performance without drift, while standard pointing metrics showed consistent improvements of the order of 10 to 20 percent. The predictive controller operates without drift, and therefore may improve reproducibility and operational efficiency in high energy, low repetition rate laser experiment conditions.",

We examine six distinct filament inclination angles ranging from 0°to 90°. The in-plane solid fraction and filament length are chosen to achieve a fully dense canopy at zero inclination, and these parameters remain constant throughout our study. By setting a nominal bulk Reynolds number of 6000, we provide a detailed statistical characterisation of the turbulent flow. Our findings illustrate distinct changes in the flow regime with varying filament inclination. At lower angles, the canopy remains dense and significantly influences the flow, conforming to a classical canopy-flow regime. However, as the inclination approaches 90°, the intra-canopy region progressively becomes shielded from the outer flow. Remarkably, at 90°inclination, the flow drag reduces significantly, and the total drag becomes lower than that typically seen in an open, filament-free flow. We document this transition from a canopy-dominated regime to a scenario where the canopy becomes largely sheltered from the outer turbulent flow, highlighting key alterations in intra-canopy dynamics as filament inclination increases. Our observations are substantiated by an analysis of the velocity spectra, providing deeper insight into the interactions between the canopy and the developing turbulent boundary layer.",

For an initial configuration in which the sheet is flat, an initial disturbance will first grow at the shortest available wavelengths, because this requires the least kinetic energy, but will subsequently transition to a longer preferred wavelength that minimises potential energy. We observe that the evolving wave pattern must be a spectrum, as opposed to a fundamental wrinkle mode whose wavelength evolves in time.

Using a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach for trees and a BCS treatment of the hyperbolic continuum, we establish a unified mean-field framework that captures the role of boundaries in hyperbolic spaces. For finite Cayley trees with open boundaries, the superconducting order parameter localizes at the edge while the interior can remain normal, leading to two distinct critical temperatures: $T_\\textrm{c}^\\textrm{edge} > T_\\textrm{c}^\\textrm{bulk}$. A corresponding boundary-dominated phase also emerges in hyperbolic annuli and horodisc regions, where radial variations of the local density of states enhance edge pairing. We also demonstrate that the enhancement of the density of states at the boundary is significantly more pronounced for the discrete tree geometry. Our results show that, owing to the macroscopic extent of the boundary, negative curvature can stabilize boundary superconductivity as a phase that persists in the thermodynamic limit on par with the bulk superconductivity.

The galaxies display a broad range of rotational support, where gas is generally more rotationally supported than stars. Differences in morphology and kinematics primarily reflect variations in halo assembly timescales and merger activity. Early-assembling, high-concentration halos form stars efficiently and become gas-poor by $z=0$, while late-assembling, low-concentration halos remain gas-rich due to delayed star formation and rejuvenated gas accretion. We identify a clear anti-correlation between rotational support and the cumulative merger mass fraction, demonstrating that dynamical heating by mergers is the dominant factor shaping kinematic diversity. In some cases, late-time mergers induce the formation of extended gas disks by delivering fresh gas and angular momentum. These results demonstrate that assembly history, rather than halo mass alone, critically shapes the present-day kinematic and morphological diversity of dwarf galaxies.",

This study introduces a two-dimensional opinion model that classifies voters into five groups, enabling precise characterization of the swing group's interactive behaviors. Importantly, we introduce antagonism effect to describe the intensities with which the two camps incite opposition and exert voting pressure in the run-up to the election, typically via Us-versus-Them framing. By integrating the open-mindedness of voters, the stubbornness of opinion interactions, and the antagonism effect manipulated by the two parties, we systematically explore the intricate interplay between top-down political campaigns and bottom-up interpersonal opinion dynamics, unveiling their nonlinear coupling impacts on the emergence, and evolution of swing voters. Counterintuitively, we find that extreme antagonism effects might backfire in presidential election: when both parties adopt intense antagonistic strategies, the party that polarizes more strongly risks alienating swing voters, thereby enabling its ostensibly weaker opponent to prevail. These insights are also validated on the core retweet networks during 2020 U.S. presidential election. Building upon multidimensional opinion model, our results highlight the possibility of manipulating swing voters and shaping electoral outcomes through antagonistic strategies of political parties. Our work also provides a nuanced and generalizable framework for analyzing opinion dynamics in other polarized public discourse.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the bi-isotropic effects in the formation and tunability of hybrid surface polaritons in bilayer configurations. We consider a heterostructure composed of a medium with bi-isotropic constitutive relations and an AFM layer. Using the transfer matrix formalism, we derive general expressions for the dispersion relations of surface polaritonic modes, including the dependence on the bi-isotropic parameter, and analyze their coupling to bulk magnon-polaritons. As an illustration of application, we consider a heterostructure formed with Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ interfaced with antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials that support terahertz-frequency magnons, specifically Cr$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and FeF$_{2}$. In the strong bi-isotropic coupling regime, the surface Dirac plasmon--phonon--magnon polariton (DPPMP) dispersion undergoes a pronounced redshift, accompanied by suppression of the characteristic anticrossing between the Dirac plasmon and the phonon. This effect, observed in all AFM materials considered, suggests a weakening of the hybrid interaction, possibly due to saturation or detuning mechanisms induced by increased $α$. Furthermore, increasing the Fermi energy of the topological insulator enhances the surface plasmon and phonon contributions, inducing a blueshift of the DPPP branches and bringing them closer to resonance with the magnon mode, thereby increasing the hybridization strength. Intriguingly, this redshift partially compensates the blueshift induced by a higher Fermi level, restoring the system to a weak-coupling regime analogous to that observed at lower Fermi energies. Our findings reveal that both the Fermi level and the bi-isotropic response offer independent and complementary control parameters for tuning the strength of light--magnon coupling in TI/AFM heterostructures, with potential implications for reconfigurable THz spintronic and photonic devices.",

We use these metrics to define qualitative criteria (e.g. scalability, efficiency, and robustness to characterised imperfections in the mitigation implementation), which we combine into application-specific certifications. We then provide a taxonomy of linear mitigation methods, characterising them by their features and requirements. Finally, we use our framework to produce and evaluate a mitigation strategy. A mitigation strategy is a collections of mitigation methods and compilation procedures designed to mitigate all relevant errors for a given piece of characterised hardware. Our example mitigation strategy is targeted at mitigating the outputs of hardware suffering from stochastic noise and/or rotational errors. We find the most significant determinant of efficient mitigation is accurate and precise characterisation.",

The ratio $v_{2}^{\\text{PP}}$/$v_{2}^{\\text{RP}}$ is investigated under different hadronic cascade times (0.6 fm/$c$, 10 fm/$c$, and the maximum evolution time) and across various collision centralities. The results show that, at a fixed collision energy, the ratio exhibits negligible sensitivity to the duration of the hadronic rescattering stage, indicating that hadronic interactions have little effect on the relative difference generated by initial-state fluctuations. However, a strong energy dependence is observed, the ratio increases with beam energy and saturates above $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} \\approx 62.4$ GeV, a trend that persists across all centralities. These findings highlight the dominant role of the partonic phase in converting initial-state geometry fluctuations into final-state momentum anisotropy. Conversely, at lower energies, the reduced partonic interaction strength limits this conversion efficiency, weakening the system's ability to preserve the initial geometric information. Our results suggest that the conversion of initial geometric fluctuations into final momentum anisotropy requires sufficient partonic interactions.",

For translational invariant system with conserved momentum, a continuous magnetization transition occurs, whereas the ground state changes discontinuously. We further investigate the transition of the ground state in the presence of harmonic confinement, which effectively models a quantum dot-like nanostructure under the influence of the environment. In both the scenarios, the entanglement entropy of the spin-sector can serve as a marker for these transitions. Interestingly, for the trapped system, a cat-like superposition state corresponds to maximum entanglement entropy below the transition, highlighting the relevance of the present model for studying the effect of decoherence on intra-particle entanglement in the context of quantum information processing.",

This requires solving the Dirac equation repeatedly, which is computationally demanding. The distillation method addresses this difficulty by using the lowest eigenvectors of the spatial Laplacian to construct a subspace in which the Dirac operator can be fully inverted. This approach is efficient for nonlocal operators such as meson-meson and baryon-baryon operators. However, local multiquark operators with four or more (anti)quarks are computationally expensive in this framework: the cost of contractions scales with a high power of the number of Laplacian eigenvectors. We present a position-space sampling method within distillation that reduces this cost scaling by performing the momentum projection only over sparse grids rather than the full spatial lattice. We demonstrate the efficiency of this unbiased estimator for single-meson, single-baryon and local tetraquark operators. Using Wilson-clover fermions at the $SU(3)$-flavour-symmetric point, we apply this method to study the importance of local tetraquark operators for the finite-volume $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ spectrum. To this end, we extend a large basis of bilocal $DD^*$ and $D^*D^*$ scattering operators by including local tetraquark operators. The inclusion of local operators leads to significant shifts in several energy levels.

Through simulations at imaginary baryon chemical potential $μ_B$ we observe that, if the strangeness neutrality condition is imposed, both the strangeness chemical potential $μ_S/μ_B$ and the strangeness susceptibility $χ_2^S$ take on constant values at the chiral transition for varying $μ_B$. We present new lattice data to extrapolate contours of constant $μ_S/μ_B$ or $χ_2^S$ to finite baryon chemical potential. We argue that they are good proxies for the QCD crossover because, as we show, they are only mildly influenced by criticality and by finite volume effects. We obtain continuum limits for these proxies up to $μ_B = 400$ MeV, through a next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^2$LO) Taylor expansion based on large-statistics data on $16^3 \\times 8$, $20^3 \\times 10$ and $24^3 \\times 12$ lattices with our 4HEX improved staggered action. We show that these are in excellent agreement with existing results for the chiral transition and, strikingly, also with analogous contours obtained with the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model. On the $16^3 \\times 8$ lattice, we carry out the expansion up to next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^4$LO), and extend the extrapolation beyond $μ_B=500$ MeV, again finding perfect agreement with the HRG model.

    "abstract": "The dipper subclass of YSOs are characterised by frequent dips in their light curves. Irregular dippers do not show periodic signatures and have dips accounting for significant proportions of their photospheric flux. Given the short timescales on which these dips occur, their driving mechanisms are linked to the inner circumstellar disc dynamics. We present the first multi-epoch analysis of 16 irregular dippers observed with X-Shooter. Investigating the properties of their dips, and in particular the analysis of the dust characteristics, we aim to understand the root of their variability, and get a glimpse of the inner disc behaviour. We employed a novel approach to measure the properties of the dips, by combining class III templates with Gaia photometry to construct the intrinsic photospheres. We measured several dip properties including the depth of the dips, near-infrared (NIR) excesses, and their optical depths as a function of wavelength. We record 20 significant dips that range in their dip properties and show no relation to one another. In almost all cases, the low optical depths and small NIR excesses are observed. Comparison of their optical depths with grain opacity models show that the dips can be explained by the presence of dust substructures containing processed grains obscuring their photospheres and/or their discs. These grain distributions can have maximum sizes as large as 20$μm$ and in many cases have almost grey-like extinction, while some require a strong scattering component. The findings highlight the extent of the irregularity of dippers, but also link it to the dust dynamics in the inner regions of circumstellar discs. The dust substructures causing the variability require processed dust grains to be lifted above the disc into the line of sight. Possible lifting mechanisms including disc winds, unstable accretion columns, and disc warps are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Super-Heisenberg scaling, which scales as $N^{-β}$ with $β>1$ in terms of the number of particles $N$ or $T^{-β}$ in terms of the evolution time $T$, is better than Heisenberg scaling in quantum metrology. It has been proven that super-Heisenberg scaling can be achieved when the Hamiltonian of the system involves many-body interactions or the time-dependent terms. We demonstrate that nonlinear quantum scrambling facilitates the achievement of super-Heisenberg scaling $T^{-β}$ when the generator of the parameter is time-independent. More importantly, in dissipative systems, we can still obtain super-Heisenberg scaling in the friction model. In the optical cavity system, an exponential improvement in measurement precision over time can be achieved by combining injected external squeezing and intracavity squeezing. Our work provides an optimal method for leveraging nonlinear resources to enhance the measurement precision of the driving field.",

    "abstract": "Neon (Ne) is the fifth most abundant element in the Universe. Because it is chemically inert, it has never been considered in astrochemical models that studied molecular evolution. In the cold dark environments of pre-stellar cores, where the temperatures are below 10 K, Ne can condense onto the surface of interstellar grains. We investigated the effect of Ne on the production of formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) and methanol (CH$_3$OH) through carbon monoxide (CO) hydrogenation on different cold surfaces. We highlight its role in conditions corresponding to pre-stellar cores. In an ultra-high vacuum system, we conducted two types of experiments. The first experiment involved the co-deposition of CO and H atoms with or without Ne. The second experiment involved depositing a monolayer of CO and separately a monolayer of Ne (or vice versa), followed by bombarding the layers with hydrogen atoms. Additionally, we used a gas-grain chemical code to simulate a pre-stellar core and determine where Ne can affect the chemistry. The presence of Ne on the surface significantly inhibits CO hydrogenation at temperatures below 12 K. In the co-deposition experiments, we observed a 38% decrease in the H$_2$CO production at 11 K when the quantity of Ne in the mixture was lower than a monolayer. At 10 K and with one monolayer in the mixture, the production decreased to 77%, and it reached 91% for a few monolayers of Ne in the mixture at 9 K. While the decrease in CH$_3$OH formation is still notable, it is less pronounced: 43% at 11 K, 61% at 10 K, and 77% at 9 K. Experiments with stacked layers revealed that the CO layer decay varies slightly when the Ne layer is positioned above or below it. This observation indicates that Ne and CO create a mixture in which Ne can diffuse and stabilize at the surface, which isolates CO molecules from the accreting H atoms.",

These states are formed due to the coupling between chain geometry and the local activity. We study the origin and emergence of such patterns in noiseless, flexible active chains. In the overdamped limit, we observed a range of dynamical steady states for different chain lengths ($N$). The steady-state planar trajectories of the centre-of-mass of the chain include circles, periodic waves, and quasiperiodic, bound trajectories resembling spirographic patterns. In addition, out-of-plane initial configuration also leads to the formation of 3D structures, including globular and supercoiled helical structures. For the shortest chain with three segments $(N=3)$, the chain always moves in a circular trajectory. Such circular trajectories are also observed in the limit of large chain lengths $(N \\gg 1)$. We analytically study the dynamical patterns in these two limiting cases, which show quantitative and qualitative matches with numerical simulations. Our analytical study also provides an estimate of the limiting $N$ where the large chain length behaviour is expected. These analyses reveal the existence of such intricately periodic patterns in active chains, arising due to the follower activity.",

The quality and completeness of light curves have a direct impact on variability studies, particularly for faint AGNs and high-redshift AGNs. To improve the quality of long-term light curves for AGNs, we bin and stack multi-epoch images balancing the image depths and temporal resolution. As a case study, we apply this method to Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) field, where the overlapping region covers an area of about 370 arcmin$^2$ and includes $g$-band and $r$-band data taken from March 2018 to December 2024. The co-added images are approximately 2.0 to 2.5 magnitudes deeper than the ZTF single-epoch images. With co-added images, we construct light curves for 73 AGNs in the EGS field. Compared to the traditional ZTF light curves, our light curves maintain consistent long-term variability trends but with higher photometric precision. Furthermore, this method can help detect AGNs with weak variability which are missed from the traditional ZTF data due to the noisy light curves or below the detection limit in ZTF's single-epoch exposure. Among the 73 AGNs, the majority exhibit a bluer-when-brighter (BWB) trend on long-term timescales, which is consistent with previous studies. This work offers insights for optimizing AGN light curves in both current and upcoming all-sky time-domain surveys.",

For these objects, we obtain complementary optical light curves from Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), and W1-band light curves from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). We perform correlation analysis to study the time lags between different bands, which may be directly related to the size of the dust torus. After correcting for infrared flux contamination from the accretion disk and accounting for the redshift effect, we measure the Ks-optical and W1-optical lags for the targets VVV J1834-2925 and VVV J1845-2426. Using typical sublimation temperatures and reverberation time lags, we obtain a graphite-to-silicate grain size ratio of $\\frac{a_C}{a_S}\\sim$ 0.4. Through SED fitting, we determine the luminosities of these quasars and find that their dust torus sizes follow the established $R_{dust}-L_{AGN}$ relation reported in previous studies.",

Yet, this superior capability comes at a cost: Each use slightly degrades the catalyst, leading to an inevitable accumulation of imperfection. This gradual decay defines their most distinctive property -- reusability -- which, despite its fundamental importance, remains largely unexplored. Here, we establish a quantitative framework to characterize the operational lifetime of embezzling catalysts, focusing on their role in entanglement distillation and extending the analysis to quantum teleportation. We show that the catalytic advantage inevitably diminishes with repeated use, deriving bounds on the maximum effective reuse rounds for a desired performance gain. Our results uncover the finite reusability of catalysts in quantum processes and point toward sustainable strategies for quantum communication.",

We optimize the configuration of the Noah land surface model with multiparameterization options (Noah-MP) for characterizing heat fluxes in the IP when the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model v3.9.1 is used as an RCM. We perform 70 one-year simulations using 35 Noah-MP combinations, for a dry year (2005) and a wet year (2010). Land-surface heat fluxes and soil moisture from WRF/Noah-MP are evaluated against FLUXNET station data and the CERRA-Land reanalysis. In general, WRF/Noah-MP reproduces soil moisture and surface heat fluxes well over the IP, especially under wetter conditions. Clustering identifies an optimal configuration from 10 groups (A to J). The Noah-MP options with greatest impact are canopy stomatal resistance (CRS), surface exchange coefficient for heat (SFC), soil-moisture factor controlling stomatal resistance (BTR), runoff and groundwater (RUN), and surface resistance to evaporation/sublimation (RSF); dynamic vegetation (DVEG) also matters. Several configurations performed reasonably; experiment s27I (Jarvis CRS, Chen97 SFC, CLM-type BTR, BATS RUN, and adjusted Sellers RSF for wet soils) provides a particularly good characterization of heat fluxes over the IP.",

    "abstract": "Network nonlocality, a recently noted form of nonlocality has been shown to have distinctive features, marking a significant departure from the notion of standard Bell nonlocality in the context of quantum correlations. On a pragmatic front, it has gained significant importance as researchers worldwide actively engage in the study on quantum networks. However, as typical to any quantum resource, network nonlocality is also vulnerable to environmental noise, which sometimes prove to be detrimental. Environmental interactions are modeled in terms of quantum channels. In the present study, we introduce and characterize network nonlocality breaking channels. Network nonlocality breaking channels model environmental influences which results in the loss of resource, i.e., the system loses its nonlocal resource due to such interactions. The study is done in the ambit of some suitably chosen inequalities in (i) linear networks and (ii) star-shaped networks. Further, the loss in full network nonlocality is also studied. Furthermore, we also characterize quantum channels according to their ability in preserving quantum resources, i., they do not break network nonlocality, which enables one to identify useful quantum channels in networks. The study is vindicated by illustrations from various noise models like depolarizing and dephasing channels.",

We develop a unified model that relates these factors to the transverse correlations observed in both near and far-field planes, treating both degenerate and non-degenerate Type-I SPDC processes equally. By explicitly incorporating crystal length, pump beam waist, and spectral filtering into the biphoton amplitude, we demonstrate that narrowband signal filtering influences frequency-angle mixing. This approach minimizes conditional position uncertainty, particularly in non-degenerate SPDC scenarios, which enhances spatial resolution while maintaining the necessary multimode structure for imaging. We further analyze birefringent walk-off in bulk crystals and demonstrate that its apparent degradation of entanglement, such as weakened transverse anti-correlations and inflated Reid products, can be corrected. This correction follows frequency non-degeneracy and walk-off-aware reconstruction, recovering the correct correlation ridge and improving entanglement strength. The framework provides quantitative design rules that link filter bandwidth, crystal length, and pump waist to achievable resolution.

By deriving the local oscillator directly from the SPOPO cavity, the setup establishes an intrinsically excellent spatial mode overlap and high interference visibility, forming a distinctive self-referenced architecture. Two spatial light modulators enable precise spectral shaping of both the pump and the local oscillator in amplitude and phase, allowing investigation of the spectral properties of the generated states. The versatility of the setup further allows exploration of different SPOPO configurations, including regimes with varied finesse and escape efficiency. Representative measurements, including homodyne traces and squeezing levels as functions of pump power and local oscillator bandwidth, demonstrate the performance of the system. Theoretical simulations based on a multimode singular-value-decomposition model reproduce well the measured dependence of squeezing on pump power and LO bandwidth, confirming the accuracy of the description and the robustness of the setup.

We find that the gas in the core is blueshifted by $v_z\\sim-200$ km s$^{-1}$ relative to the brightest cluster galaxy, while the low-entropy gas inside the cold front is redshifted by $v_z\\sim 200$ km s$^{-1}$. As one moves further off-center across the front, the line-of-sight (LoS) velocity changes significantly, by $Δv_z=535^{+167}_{-154}$ km s$^{-1}$, back to the value similar to that in the core. There are no significant LoS velocity gradients perpendicular to the cluster symmetry axis. These features suggest that the gas forming the cold front is flowing in the plane oriented along the LoS, supporting an offset merger scenario in which the main cluster has passed in front of the subcluster and induced rotation of the core gas in the plane perpendicular to the sky. The region just inside the front exhibits the largest LoS velocity dispersion seen across two pointings, $σ_z\\sim420$ km s$^{-1}$, which can be interpreted as a developing turbulence or a projection of the LoS velocity shear within the front. The large LoS velocity jump across the cold front, combined with the lack of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the surface of the front, suggests some mechanism to suppress it. For example, a magnetic field with $B>5\\,μ$G is required if the cold front is stabilized by magnetic draping.",

We show that systematic spectral degeneracies, which hinder selective addressing, are a direct consequence of rational Kerr-nonlinearity ratios ($K_1/K_2$). Our solution is a universal architectural principle: engineer this ratio to be a complex rational value, approximating an incommensurate number to systematically eliminate parasitic resonances. Using a Magnus expansion, we derive a complete effective Hamiltonian, including all Stark-shift corrections, to accurately target transitions. We numerically validate this framework by demonstrating protocols for the deterministic synthesis of NOON states, and high-photon-number Fock states (e.g., $n=4$), achieving ideal fidelities exceeding $\\mathcal{F}>99.9\\%$. The protocols are shown to be robust against environmental decay and thermal effects. This work provides an architectural blueprint for bosonic processors in circuit QED and establishes foundational principles that could inform future designs of multi-mode quantum systems.",

    "abstract": "Large offshore wind farm wakes in shallow atmospheric boundary layers (ABL) exhibit often an asymmetric behaviour when observed through Synthetic-Aperture-Radar or simulated through Large-Eddy Simulations (LES). In previous LES of wind farms in the northern hemisphere, the asymmetry manifests as a streak at the left side of the wake, looking downstream, where the turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) is greater than the surrounding flow. This work aims at clarifying the physical mechanism that leads to the formation of such a phenomenon. Identifying the Coriolis force as one possible source of asymmetry in the resolved physics, we simulate a real wind farm located in the German Bight operating under different ABLs: one representative of the northern hemisphere; one of the southern hemisphere; and three fictitious ABLs where the Coriolis effects on the inflow and wake, i.e. veer and the wake deflecting force, are removed individually or altogether. Our results show that the TKE streak appears on the opposite side of the wake, i. the right one, in the southern hemisphere, and it is primarily caused by veer in the incoming flow, a result of the Coriolis force in a marine ABL. The process involves a larger TKE production which originates from a larger vertical shear promoted where the undisturbed veer profile converges towards the wake in the top part of the ABL. We find that the TKE streak improves the farm wake recovery modestly. Finally, we compare the asymmetry modelled by LES with those observed in several on-field measurements, finding striking similarities.",

In comparison to the best classical algorithm with $O(n^2)$ scaling, where $n$ is the number of vertexes, our quantum algorithm achieves a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ for finding a large IS, which reduces to $O(n)$ for identifying a size-2 IS. The complexity bounds we obtain are confirmed numerically for a specific case with the $O(n^2)$ quantum algorithm outperforming the classical greedy algorithm, that also runs in $O(n^2)$. The definitive analytical and numerical evidence for the quadratic quantum speedup benefited from an analytical framework based on the Magnus expansion in the interaction picture (MEIP), which overcomes the dependence on the ground state degeneracy encountered in conventional energy gap analysis. In addition, our analysis links the performance of QAA to the spectral structure of the median graph, bridging algorithmic complexity, graph theory, and experimentally realizable Rydberg Hamiltonians. The understanding gained provides practical guidance for optimizing near-term Rydberg atom experiments by revealing the significant impact of detuning on blockade violations.",

In this work, we investigate within density functional theory the properties of the hidden spin texture and spin-layer segregation in a prototype centrosymmetric dichalcogenide-monolayer material using an electric-field-based method. This method is shown to yield a precise and robust alternative to traditional layer-projected spin-polarization techniques for obtaining the intrinsic hidden spin textures in such materials. Moreover, it gives access at the same time to the spatial distribution within the monolayer of the individual spin-segregated states responsible for the hidden spin textures, not provided by other techniques. With this approach we determine and study the hidden spin textures of the upper valence bands of the PtTe2 monolayer together with the spatial behavior of the probability densities and spin polarization densities of the corresponding maximally segregated spin states. This combined study enabled by the electric-field method yields new insights into the mechanisms controlling the spin-layer segregation and resulting hidden spin texture in such systems. We also discuss the symmetry rules governing the shape in the Brillouin zone of the hidden spin texture, which can be straightforwardly predicted within the present framework.",

These motions can seriously deteriorate the quality of the final image at the level of image reconstruction and attenuation corrections. Movements can have rhythmic patterns, related to respiratory or cardiac motions, or they can be abrupt reflexive actions caused by the patient's discomfort. Many approaches, software and hardware, have been developed to mitigate this problem where each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages. In this work we present a simulation study of a head monitoring device, named CrowN@22, intended to be used in conjunction with a dedicated brain PET scanner. The CrowN@22 device consists of six point sources of non-pure positron emitter isotopes, such as 22Na or 44Sc, mounted in crown-like rings around the head of the patient. The relative positions of the point sources are predefined and their actual position, once mounted, can be reconstructed by tagging the extra 1274 keV photon (in the case of 22Na). These two factors contribute to a superb signal-to-noise ratio, distinguishing between the signal from the 22Na monitor point sources and the background signal from the FDG in the brain. Hence, even with a low activity for the monitor point sources, as low as 10 kBq per point source, in the presence of 75 MBq activity of 18F in the brain, one can detect brain movements with a precision of less than 0.3 degrees, or 0.5 mm, which is of the order of the PET spatial resolution, at a sampling rate of 1 Hz.",

This inherently three-dimensional process is typically approximated in one-dimensional hydrocodes using dimensionless turbulent convection (TC) free parameters. Calibrating these parameters is essential for reproducing key observational features such as light-curve amplitudes, secondary bumps, and the red edge of the instability strip. In this work, we calibrate TC parameters adopted in the publicly available MESA-RSP code through comparison with both observational data of classical Cepheids and stellar parameter constraints from the Stellingwerf code. We compute multi-band (V, I, and Ks) MESA-RSP light curves for 18 observed Large Magellanic Cloud Cepheids, using stellar parameters determined from the Stellingwerf code. By fine-tuning the mixing-length and eddy viscosity parameters, we calibrate the TC treatment in MESA-RSP. We then compare the resulting period-luminosity (PL), period-radius (PR), and period-mass-radius (PMR) relations with predictions from the Stellingwerf models. We successfully reproduce multi-band light curves and obtain PL, PR, and PMR relations consistent with Ragosta et al. (2019). While in broad agreement with previous work, we explicitly identify distinct mass-luminosity (ML) relations for fundamental-mode and first-overtone Cepheids for the first time. This suggests that the macroscopic processes affecting the ML relation depend on stellar mass and/or effective temperature range. Although our study focuses on the calibration of TC parameters, we do not find a single set of parameter values that reproduces all light curves. No statistically significant correlation is found between stellar properties and convection parameters, although subtle trends with period and effective temperature may be present.",

This approach systematically modified the set of states reachable by the original circuit, enhancing accuracy while preserving efficiency. We provide a rigorous proof that such framework increases the expressive capacity of any given VQA ansatz, and demonstrate its broad applicability across different ansatz families. As applications, we apply the method to ground-state preparation of the transverse-field Ising, cluster-Ising, and Fermi-Hubbard models, achieving consistently higher accuracy under the same gate budget compared with standard VQAs. These results highlight input-state design as a powerful complement to circuit design in realizing VQAs that are both expressive and trainable.",

Furthermore, this model can contribute to accounting for the lack of power anomaly in the low $l$ angular power spectra of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Using the latest data from the Planck (2018) collaboration, we establish observational constraints on the model parameters, which produce a characteristic low-$\\ell$ suppression in the cosmic microwave background spectrum. We conclude that the Planck data support the solution presented in the previous works, in other words, that the model allows us to solve simultaneously the emergence of the cosmic structure and, at the same time, avoid the eternal inflation scenario.",

Here, we overcome this limitation by advancing microwave cytometry with machine learning-enabled shape recognition. Microwave cytometry is a flow-through electronic platform that integrates microwave resonator responses with low-frequency impedance signals to capture the dielectric signatures of individual particles. Using microscopy-derived shape measurements as ground truth, we trained a random forest model to decode these information-rich waveforms. Once trained, the system operates without optical input, enabling electronic-only determination of particle geometry. We demonstrate extraction of the major and minor axes of ellipsoidal microparticles with <8% relative error on average and use these predictions to derive the dielectric permittivity of ellipsoid particles. This approach removes long-standing shape assumptions in microplastic sensing and establishes a pathway toward portable, high-throughput, morphology-aware detection technologies.",

Two-dimensional (2D) materials offer large-area, atomically flat surfaces suitable for massively parallel in-plane biomolecule imaging, yet achieving guided motion in one-dimensional confinements using top-down nanofabrication remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that thermally induced wrinkles in exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) act as self-assembled nanochannels that enable biomolecule confinement and imaging under wide-field fluorescence microscopy. By controlling annealing parameters and substrate properties, we obtain scalable and reproducible wrinkle networks whose densities and morphologies can be tuned. Structural characterization using atomic force and scanning electron microscopy is complemented by fluorescence imaging and Kelvin probe force microscopy, confirming that aqueous solutions fill and remain stably retained within the nanochannels for periods exceeding 10 hours. We further achieve selective ATTO647N-DNA localization and imaging in the one-dimensional channels through the formation of a graphene/hBN vertical heterostructure. The graphene overlayer serves as a quenching mask that suppresses background fluorescence both from high-strain hBN regions and from DNA adsorbed on top of the 2D layer.

This is achieved by relaxing the perfect fluid assumption in the standard model and considering a general viscous cosmic fluid (vCF) with non-zero particle creation rate and evolving adiabatic equation of state. Transition points of the Universe and the finite boundary connecting them is exactly determined. We then propose a novel method to determine the early-time viscous coefficient and inflation energy scale using the Cosmic Mode Index value postulated by Padmanabhan. Considering the data from the Planck 2018 analysis, this yields an inflationary Hubble parameter of $H_{I}\\approx10^{13}$\\,GeV. An equivalent scalar-field description for the inflationary epoch is then constructed and inferences are made regarding the nature of inflation. Notably, we find that the model describes an ultra-slow-roll hilltop inflation scenario with a graceful exit to radiation-dominated epoch. Subsequently, we show that bulk viscosity in this model can be expressed as Israel-Stewart equation in relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics with an appropriate underlying viscous coefficient and relaxation time that satisfy the causality constraint in its extreme limit.

Conventional projectile-impact models, based on conservation laws and energy partitioning, often rely on constitutive- and geometry-specific empirical corrections because the projectile-target system is rarely closed and most material behaviors under extreme thermo-mechanical loading remain elusive. In contrast, we show that momentum transfer, governed by the collision impulse, provides a fundamental and unifying description of impact response across a broad spectrum of materials, geometries, and loading conditions. With microprojectile impact tests across varied geometries and scales, validated by targeted macroscale experiments, we examine the interplay of two dominant momentum transfer pathways: material cohesion and target inertia, supported by conclusive evidence from post-perforation microscopy. We reveal a universal upper bound at the ballistic-limit velocity corresponding to the maximum projectile deceleration, which persists across materials, scales, and architectures in both our data and prior studies. By extending this bound into the energy absorption landscape, we identify its parametric dependence across geometry and scale and correct an entrenched misconception that the impact response is not scale-invariant for self-similar geometries. Furthermore, we reveal that specific energy absorption exaggerates the performance of thinner targets by inflating their apparent energy capacity. This work not only redefines how high-velocity projectile perforation is understood but also establishes a framework that applies broadly to momentum-driven dynamic events such as cold spray deposition, surface mechanical attrition treatment, and meteorite impacts.",

In this context, we apply the classical framework of wetting and capillarity -- integrating analytical methods with sharp- and diffuse-interface numerical simulations -- to elucidate the physical underpinnings of HIV nuclear entry. Our analysis captures several key phenomena: the reorientation of incoming capsids due to torques arising from asymmetric capillary forces; the role of confinement in limiting capsid penetration depths; the classification of translocation mechanics according to changes in topology and interfacial area; and the influence of (spontaneous) rotational symmetry-breaking on energetics.

    "abstract": "The standard $Λ{\\rm CDM}$ model has encountered serious challenges and the $H_0$ tension has become more significant with increasingly precise cosmological observation. Meanwhile, inconsistencies in measurements of the curvature parameter $Ω_\\mathrm{K}$ between different datasets also have emerged. In this work, we employ two global and cosmic age-based parameterizations, PAge and MAPAge, to perform model-independent measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$ and $Ω_\\mathrm{K}$ by utilizing the inverse distance ladder (IDL). To construct the PAge-improved IDL, we utilize the strong gravitational lensing (SGL), cosmic chronometers (CC), and gamma ray bursts (GRB) data to calibrate the latest DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation data and DESY5 type Ia supernova data. Our analysis indicate that DESI+DESY5+SGL+CC+GRB gives $H_0=71.59\\pm 0.94\\,{\\rm km}~{\\rm s}^{-1}~{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ in the MAPAge model, reducing the $H_0$ tension to the $1.0σ$ level. Extending to MAPAge$+Ω_{\\rm K}$ model, we obtain $Ω_\\mathrm{K}=0.001\\pm 0.038$, which suggests that current late-time data are consistent with a flat universe. Finally, the Bayesian analysis indicates that the present late-universe data provide weak to moderate evidence in favor of PAge and MAPAge relative to $Λ{\\rm CDM}$.",

    "abstract": "We examine the quantum dynamics of a large spin in the presence of static and rotating magnetic fields. By mapping the system onto a gas of non-interacting spin-1/2 particles, we derive exact analytical results for the dynamics with different initial states. The dynamics exhibit periodic oscillations between two maximally stretched states, irrespective of how large the spin is. Further, we observe periodic transitions between sublevels with magnetic quantum numbers of opposite signs. Additionally, the dynamics features the periodic transfer of the spin to the maximally stretched state starting from a superposition state. The evolution of the dipole moment is also explored in each case, and as expected, it is precessing about the instantaneous, resultant magnetic field. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to a pair of spins, taking into account the dipole-dipole interactions between them. We analyze how the ground state entanglement between the spins depends on the external fields. The quantum dynamics of the two spins reveal entanglement resonances and kinks, which can be identified from the energy spectrum when weak transverse field strengths are considered. Finally, we discuss the regime in which the dipolar interactions are relatively weak.",

    "abstract": "Bell inequality violation is the phenomenon where multiple non-communicating parties can exhibit correlations using quantum resources that are impossible if they can only use classical resources. One way to enforce non-communication is to apply a latency constraint: the parties must all produce outputs after they receive their inputs within a time window shorter than the speed of light delay between any pair of parties. If this latency constraint is relaxed so that a subset of the parties can communicate, we can obtain a new set of inequalities on correlations that extends Bell inequalities in a very natural way. Moreover, with this relaxed latency constraint, we can also have quantum communication between a subset of parties and thereby achieve possible quantum violations of these new inequalities. We ultimately wish to answer the fundamental question: \"What are the physically realizable correlations between multiple parties under varying latency constraints?\" To answer this question, we introduce latency-constrained games, a mathematical framework that extends nonlocal games to the setting where a subset of parties can communicate. The notion of latency-constrained games can have real-world applications, including high frequency trading, distributed computing, computer architecture, and distributed control systems.",

Here we introduce incoherent dielectric tensor tomography (iDTT), a non-interferometric optical imaging method that quantitatively reconstructs the 3D dielectric tensor under incoherent, polarization-diverse illumination. By combining polarization diversity and angular-spectrum modulation, iDTT achieves speckle-free and vibration-robust mapping of biaxial birefringence with submicron resolution. Simulations and experiments on uniaxial and biaxial samples validate its quantitative accuracy. Applied to mixed and polycrystalline materials, iDTT distinguishes crystal types by their birefringent properties and reveals 3D grain orientations and boundaries.

Additionally, we connect for the first time the Chromosome Diagram to the two-stream age-metallicity relation, allowing us to link the P1 and P2 stars to the distinct star formation tracks, proposed to be in-situ and ex-situ contributions to the cluster's assembly. Our results are consistent with some suggested formation models and rule out others but no current model can explain all observed features of the subpopulations.",

In this work, we investigate the temporal evolution of key indicators of dynamical relaxation, with particular emphasis on the secular growth of the diffuse intragroup light (IGL), the four major group galaxies, and the mass distributions of their progenitors. We also assess the diagnostic power of several magnitude gaps between top-ranked galaxies as proxies for dynamical age. As in our previous study, we compare outcomes from three group classes defined by the number of brightest group galaxies (BGGs) present at the end of the simulations. The early assembly of galaxy groups is consistent with a stochastic Poisson process at an approximately constant merger rate. Various dynamical diagnostics - including galaxy pairwise separations, velocity dispersions, and the offset of the first-ranked galaxy from the group barycentre - indicate that single-BGG groups evolve more rapidly towards virialisation than double- and especially non-BGG systems. We further find that first-ranked group members and the IGL, follow distinct growth histories, with the IGL assembled from a more numerous and systematically lower-mass population than the central object. This distinction is particularly pronounced in non-BGG systems, where about one third of the IGL originates from small galaxies, each contributing less than 5% to this component. Among the tested magnitude gaps, the difference between the first- and fourth-ranked galaxies, $ΔM4-1$, proves a more robust indicator of dynamical age for low-mass groups than the conventional $ΔM2-1$ gap. The $ΔM5-1$ and $ΔM6-1$ gaps also perform well and may be preferable in certain contexts.",

Spatially resolved analysis of the pure rotational H$_2$ lines (S(1)-S(7)) reveals a characteristic power-law temperature distribution in different apertures, with the two prominent southern star-forming regions exhibiting unexpectedly high molecular gas temperatures, comparable to those in the AGN powered nuclear region. We investigate potential heating mechanisms including direct AGN photoionisation, UV fluorescent excitation from young star clusters, and shock excitation. We find that shock heating gives the most plausible explanation, consistent with multiple near- and mid-IR tracers and diagnostics. Using photoionisation models from the PhotoDissociation Region Toolbox, we quantify the ISM conditions in the different regions, determining that the southern star-forming regions have a high density ($n_H \\sim 10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) and are irradiated by a moderate UV radiation field ($G_0 \\sim 10^{3}$ Habing). Fitting a suite of Paris-Durham shock models to the rotational H$_2$ lines, as well as rovibrational 1-0 S(1), 1-0 S(2), and 2-1 S(1) H$_2$ emission lines, we find that a slow ($v_s \\sim 10$ km/s) C-type shock is likely responsible for the elevated temperatures.

By tuning the laser wavelength over the two-photon ionization threshold, we adjust the initial energy of the electrons and can thus investigate the transition from an ultracold plasma to a dense Rydberg gas. Our experimental setup provides access to the kinetic energy of the released electrons, which allows us to distinguish between bound, free and plasma electrons. The large bandwidth of the ultrashort laser pulse makes it possible to overcome the Rydberg blockade which fundamentally limits the density in excitation schemes with narrow-band lasers. To understand the many-body dynamics at the microscopic level, we employ molecular dynamics simulations where the electrons are modeled as individual particles including collisional ionization and recombination processes. We find that the ultrafast dynamics within the first few nanoseconds is responsible for the final distribution of free, bound and plasma electrons and agrees well with the experimental observation.

The subtle balance in how two nucleons interact shapes the universe's hydrogen content that is central to our existence. Our objective is to compute the interaction strength while varying the parameters of nature to understand how delicate this balance is. We developed a new code using sophisticated physics algorithms and a highly optimized library for simulations on CPU-GPU parallel architectures. It has excellent weak scaling and impressive linear scaling for a fixed problem size with increasing number of nodes up to El Capitan's full $\\sim$11,000 nodes. On Alps, El Capitan, Frontier, Jupiter, and Perlmutter supercomputers we achieve a maximum disruptive speed-up of $\\sim$240 times the previous state-of-the-art, signaling a new era of supercomputing.",

This unprecedented composition, combined with substantial absolute CO levels (CO/H2O = 1.65+-0.09) and red spectral slopes, provides direct evidence for galactic cosmic ray (GCR) processing of the outer layers of the interstellar comet nucleus. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that GCR irradiation efficiently converts CO to CO2 while synthesizing organic-rich crusts, suggesting that the outer layers of 3I/ATLAS consist of irradiated material which properties are consistent with the observed composition of 3I/ATLAS coma and with its observed spectral reddening. Estimates of the erosion rate of 3I/ATLAS indicate that current outgassing samples the GCR-processed zone only (depth ~15-20 m), never reaching pristine interior material. Outgassing of pristine material after perihelion remains possible, though it is considered unlikely. This represents a paradigm shift: long-residence interstellar objects primarily reveal GCR-processed material rather than pristine material representative of their primordial formation environments. With 3I/ATLAS approaching perihelion in October 2025, immediate follow-up observations are critical to confirm this interpretation and establish GCR processing as a fundamental evolutionary pathway for interstellar objects.",

    "abstract": "Unveiling massive stars' internal structure and the physical origin and efficiency of the internal mixing processes? It is now possible using the apsidal motion rate in close eccentric binaries! The apsidal motion rate depends on the tidal interactions occurring between the stars and is proportional to k2, a measure of the star's inner density profile. Confronting standard stellar models with observations reveals the famous k2-discrepancy: models predict too high a k2 for the stars, that is to say, stars with too low a density contrast between their core and envelope. We built bespoke GENEC stellar evolution models including tidal mixing for the twin massive binary HD 152248. The models reveal the instabilities allowing to reproduce the stellar density profiles: advecto-diffusive models better reproduce k2 than magnetic models. A large overshooting is necessary to converge towards the observed k2, yet alone is not sufficient. While a change in metallicity or mass-loss rate has no significant impact on k2, a larger initial helium abundance allows us to better reproduce the k2. Yet, a super-solar helium abundance is not observationally supported. Our analyses highlight the need for a process in the stars that slows down the radial expansion.",

    "abstract": "The interplay between the accretion of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and the stellar mass growth of the host galaxies is still a matter of hot debate. The accretion of the SMBHs is expected to release energy under the form of AGNs. This energy is believed to impact the star formation activity and contribute to the quenching of galaxies. Here, we address this key unsolved issue with our cosmological semi-empirical model DECODE. In DECODE, we grow galaxies with their SFR linked to halo accretion rate distributions via abundance matching. SMBHs are evolved following the stellar mass growth of their host galaxies by assigning an accretion rate at each redshift from the empirical Eddington ratio distributions and duty cycles. We test the assumption that galaxies permanently quench when their central SMBHs approach the limit imposed by the observed $M_{\\rm BH} - σ_\\star$ relation, as a proxy of SMBH disruptive feedback. We find that simply imposing the $M_{\\rm BH} - σ_\\star$ condition is sufficient to generate a fraction of quenched galaxies consistent with current data, including the newest ones from Euclid. In addition, our minimal, data-driven model, also predicts SMBH scaling relations consistent in slope and normalisation with those observed, and an $M_{\\rm BH} - M_\\star$ relation weakly evolving with redshift. The model also naturally generates SMBH accretion rates peaking within 1 Gyr of their host SFHs. We note that all the main predictions on galaxy quenched fractions and SMBH growth histories and scaling relations are degenerate with those expected in a halo quenching model. The comprehensive data-driven model presented in this work represents an invaluable tool to investigate SMBH demography across time and environments in an accurate, physically motivated manner, ideally suited to rapidly explore the implications from large surveys, such as Euclid and Rubin-LSST.",

Such simulations -- for which classical methods are often inaccurate -- are critical to advancing our knowledge and understanding of quantum chemistry and materials, underpinning a wide range of fields, from biochemistry to clean-energy technologies and chemical synthesis. However, the performance of all previous digital quantum simulations has been matched by classical methods, and it has thus far remained unclear whether near-term, intermediate-scale quantum hardware could offer any computational advantage in this area. Here, we implement an efficient quantum simulation algorithm on Quantinuum's System Model H2 trapped-ion quantum computer for the time dynamics of a 56-qubit system that is too complex for exact classical simulation. We focus on the periodic spinful 2D Fermi-Hubbard model and present evidence of spin-charge separation, where the elementary electron's charge and spin decouple. In the limited cases where ground truth is available through exact classical simulation, we find that it agrees with the results we obtain from the quantum device. Employing long-range Wilson operators to study deconfinement of the effective gauge field between spinons and the effective potential between charge carriers, we find behaviour that differs from predictions made by classical tensor network methods. Our results herald the use of quantum computing for simulating strongly correlated electronic systems beyond the capacity of classical computing.",

Through mean-field analysis and numerical simulations based on the open-system discrete truncated Wigner approximation, we demonstrate that Rydberg excitations exhibit predator-prey cycles on microsecond timescales. We show that quantum coherence drives spontaneous symmetry breaking, while long-range interactions stabilize global oscillations against quantum-noise-induced desynchronization. We further reveal that quantum jump induce quasicycles whose amplitude scales inversely with the square root of the system size. Our work extends the study of predator-prey models to the quantum realm and advances quantum simulation stratagies that leverage engineered many-body nonequilibrium effects.",

Here, we develop a tripartite entanglement distillation scheme using an eight-photon quantum platform, demonstrating entanglement superactivation phenomena which are unique to multipartite systems. We successfully generate a three-photon genuinely entangled state from two bi-separable states via local operations and classical communication, demonstrating superactivation of genuine multipartite entanglement. Furthermore, we extend our scheme to generate a three-photon state capable of extracting an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair from two initial states lacking this capability, revealing a previously unobserved entanglement superactivation phenomenon. Our methods and findings offer not only practical applications for quantum networks, but also lead to a deeper understanding of multipartite entanglement structures.",

Are you ready to gear up your coaching and perhaps your psychotherapy with techniques that you can use that will really help you understand your clients and have a bigger impact and have them go away understanding what they've learned and the progress they've made. So, like, for example, how do you know what meta programs had to be meta programs with me what lab profile patterns or meta programs. Do your clients have when they're in a stuck state? What is a typical combination patterns they have when they're stuck? And what do you need to do about it? What are the conversational techniques? We're going to be looking at some of my newest experiments and you're going to get a chance to try them out with yourself and with a partner and give feedback on them. We also want to hear from you about what your techniques are. What have you learned? What are the hacks you've learned over the years that you've been working with people? So this is an advanced workshop. We're assuming or I'm assuming since I'm the one leading it that you know about NLP and you've had some experience or a lot of experience in working with clients. So we're going to be looking at some spatial things, some verbal things all around techniques. And the idea is that we do some training. We actually practice and do feedback. So you're going to get a chance to be the subject and the intervener. Is that a word? Intervener, facilitator, coach, therapist, whatever it is. And we're going to laugh a lot and get a lot of energy. So some of the exercises will be done sitting down and some standing up if you can do that. So I really look forward to seeing you for 90 minutes of fast paced learning that are really going to hone your coaching skills verbally, non-verbally and spatially looking forward to it.

{"audio_title": "2023 NLP International Conference - Fiona Campbell - Session Taster Video [EKT-kUnwSkk].mp3", "audio_text": " Are you aware that over 73% of people have a fear of speaking in public or giving presentations? Now that's one of the biggest, the biggest fear that people have globally. But it's the biggest fear that holds people back in business. Because as a business leader, a business professional, an NLP professional and a coach, you have to be able to stand up there and talk about your business and present yourself. My name is Fiona Campbell and I've been working with NLP for over 30 years, specifically for business and coaching. Now, I've worked with thousands of business clients to help them gain more confidence when they're presenting. You can say, I've seen many, many people that have been sent to presentation courses and they get taken through the structure of presenting and yet they still can't present. And the reason for that is presenting comes from within. You can be taught how to stand, how to give eye contact, how to work with PowerPoints, how to look at the audience. But if you're not comfortable in the inside, then that is going to show. We've got an incredible range of NLP techniques that can help you really connect with your audience. Because good presenting is all about connecting with the heart of someone. Helping someone really take in information, help them feel as if you care about them. One of the things that I have noticed with many of the people, in fact, most of the people that I've worked with presenting, is the pictures they make in their head. They forget to take themselves to the end of the presentation. What they do is they create this visual submodality in their head, this picture in their head, and then they normally freeze frame it at the scariest parts. So then when they're thinking about presenting, all they get is this big scary image that comes up. Guess what? When you can take someone in their mind to the end of the presentation and complete that presentation successfully for them, that's you well on the way to helping someone present well. That's only one of the techniques we're going to use. In this workshop I've put together, I'm going to be showing you lots of different ways that you can use your NLP skills to either work with yourself or maybe even the clients you're working for. This works. NLP skills are so powerful for helping people change the way they present themselves and take them very quickly from maybe being terrified of presenting to going, I'm confident about this. Now, of course, people have to practice. There's going to be, there's a lot of practical elements behind presenting in public speaking, but I'll take you through that in the workshop. So my name is Fiona Campbell. I look forward to seeing you soon.

I'm an NLP Master Practitioner and passionate about speed reading and helping you to get on top of your reading and learn faster and smarter. I've been teaching speed reading for more than 22 years, especially for personal development, students and business professionals. And with Susan Norman, I'm also the co-author of the Speed Reading Bible. Hello, I'm Susan Norman. I'm also an NLP Master Practitioner. I'm the author of more than 40 books, including In Your Hands, NLP for Language Learning. I'm an expert in accelerated learning, especially as it applies to language learning and speed reading. During our session at the NLP conference, we're going to introduce the basic concepts of speed reading, techniques and strategies to help you read more efficiently and more effectively. You'll be putting some of these into practice then and there. And our aim is that you'll at least double your reading speed and have many other strategies that you can apply to your reading thereafter. Some of the techniques that you're going to learn, if you're already an NLP practitioner, you probably already know, such as the outcome, purpose, state, also reframing, and all done in the context of accelerated learning and speed reading. So you're going to learn how to transfer your existing skills into speed reading. Although speed reading, as the name suggests, is about speed, it's also about the quality and volume of information. Some techniques are about speeding up your reading and some about reading more. You're going to read more, you're going to remember more, and you're going to be more successful. As some studies suggest that speed readers are successful because they get information, knowledge, and wisdom faster. We'll provide material for you to read, so all you need to do is turn up. We look forward to seeing you there. par plan. I'll show you there. These 1991s are just given what you've prepared for. All yes, so I intend to take your reading map, so I fall in.

The movement of our bodies, the movement of our lives, the movement within us and that of the earth around us. There are many ways to move and each human being is unique. You are unique in your own body, in your own expression of yourself. Each human being has its own energy and with generative NLP and somatic mind, we can live a journey of self-discovery to be the change you want to see in the world professionally or personally. As a dancer, I have developed a method which I call Generative Somatic Movement to help people to connect deeply to themselves, to their body, to each part of their body, to embody the change they want to live in the world. I am Nathalie Lebas. I'm French, you can hear with my accent. I'm the manager of a generative training, coaching and consulting company. I work in the world of business as well as the world of personal development. As an NLP master trainer, trained by the best teachers in the world, Robert Dills, Judith Delosier, Susie Smith, Chris and Tim Album, Judith Lowe, Robbie Steinhaus and Stephen Gilligan and others, I have created a Generative NLP and Somatic Mind Institute in France. In this highly cognitive and constantly changing world, everyone may feel the need to come back to basic, to come back home, to come back to themselves. And this somatic practice, this is about body movement, enables you to connect to all parts of your body, to your emotions and to bring awareness to everything you feel, to calm the nervous system down and to move forward in a more confident way towards your authentic being, your identity and your desired state. Thank you. In this masterclass, you will learn that the transformation process begins with centering and reconnecting with yourself, with your body by bringing all the curiosity necessary through movement and mindfulness. Through an exploration of your body, through movement, NLP skills and music, you will find new possibilities of being present to yourself and all worlds. I will guide you on a journey to enter in the realm of NLP Somatic Universe, to rediscover your body, its wellness, in its ability to move, to open new expression of yourself, in order to move forward in the world. It's a journey of self-discovery, of your own hero's journey at your own pace. I am an awakener of people's dreams and I love it. Be careful. My presentation will include generative NLP, some movements with music, the importance of somatic mind and how it can change your internal and external world.

{"audio_title": "What makes Clean Language \u2018clean\u2019 - Penny Tompkins & James Lawley [P3icxlpgPhE].mp3", "audio_text": " David Grove used to say all questions are up to something. The distinction between leading and clean questions is they are up to different things. The vast majority of questions people ask whether in everyday conversation or in a professional setting are leading. A new book, Clean Language Interviewing, goes into great detail about the difference between the two types of question. David Grove spent 25 years looking for clean non-leading questions. In all that time he found less than a dozen that are universally clean. That is, they can be asked in almost any context including therapy and coaching. So what makes a clean language question clean? And why are there so few of them? Despite what followers of Carl Rogers might think, there's no such thing as a non-directive question. All questions are directive, even clean language questions, in that every question invites the client to consider one thing rather than another. Clean language questions operate at a process level. They do not introduce any content, they only incorporate the information that's already been supplied by the client using their exact words. All the other words in the question are process words that are short, simple, and relate to fundamental ideas about space, time, and matter. The reason there are so few questions that meet this criteria is because there is a surprisingly small number of universal concepts that exist in every language studied so far. These universal concepts are called semantic primes and they form the basis of the classic clean language language questions such as, and is there anything else about, and what kind of is that, and where is. But there's more to a clean language question than the words. There's also the purpose or intention of a clean question and the way it is asked. Clean language questions are designed to send a client on a quest for self-knowledge. We call this the client self-modeling. Even when a facilitator feels they need to know the answer to a question, clean language questions are designed so that the client discovers the information for themselves first, and only then, if they wish, shares it with the facilitator. As David Grove used to say, clean language is deeply agreeable to the client's heart and soul. A list of the commonly asked clean questions, including translations in over 20 languages, are freely available on our website cleanlanguage.com. We'd love to have you join us at our Masterclass.

{"audio_title": "2023 NLP International Conference -  Cat Trebilco - Session Taster Video [eJU72ZIXeXs].mp3", "audio_text": " Hi, I'm Kat Trabilco and I'm an NLP trainer and a coach and specifically I specialise in outdoor coaching. Now today just because of the wind I'm hiding out in the greenhouse but I wanted to ask you the question, have you ever thought about taking your coaching practice into the outdoors? Have you ever thought about getting high during a coaching practice? Now fear not, I'm not talking anything to do with drugs, I'm talking about quite literally getting high, getting high up and getting some kind of view where you can see a big expansive perspective in front of you and how you can use that with clients to help bring some enlightenment or problem solving or just quite literally to get a different perspective. So during the session I'm going to be looking at the benefits of taking coaching outside and that's benefits both for you as the coach and also the benefits for the clients. I'm going to be exploring some of the science around why it works, what does being out in nature do for us, how does it enhance our problem solving skills, how does it enhance our connection with ourselves and some of the other things that being in the outdoors can help you with. I'm also then going to look at the practicalities of taking your coaching into the outdoors. Common things that come up are challenges with the weather, how you can take notes and things like fitness levels as well. And then I'm going to be exploring two things in more detail in the session. One is around metaphors and our use of metaphors. Now coaching metaphors are really rich and so many of them are nature based. Things like can't see the wood for the trees or the sun always shines above the clouds when you're stuck in the clouds at that moment in time. Also things like weathering the storm. So how can you use these metaphors to enrich a coaching session by actually taking someone out into their metaphor? So how could you look at how a tree system or different animals are weathering a storm and is there anything you can learn from that? You know, when we talk about getting a different perspective and this is where the getting high comes in. How can you get high up and quite literally get a different perspective on something? Can you put your problem down in a valley and look at it from above or look past it or around it and see some other elements that are going on in the situation? And then finally, I'm going to be sharing with you a new tool called the decision making compass and how this can help clients who are exploring maybe two different pathways that they can take and how quite literally you can take them out to two different pathways and help them make a decision where they've got one option or another to choose from. So let me ask you again, have you ever thought about taking your coaching practice outside? Come along to the session and together like a bunch of adventurers, we can explore the topic a little further.

{"audio_title": "How Do You Ask a Clean Language Question - Penny Tompkins & James Lawley [4f2073Kx4KA].mp3", "audio_text": " In the early days of modelling David Grove, Penny and I attended every workshop he did when he was in the UK. They were usually residential, so we had a lot of access to him. The more we showed up, the more he realised just how serious we were about getting good at using his method. One day, David overheard Penny practising asking clean language questions with another participant. That evening, he asked her if she would like to do some practice with him. Who's going to say no to that? David and I stood up about ten feet, three metres apart, facing each other. Then he said, go on, ask me a question. So I asked him, and what would you like to have happen? He said, where do you think that question landed? Well, probably over there, I said, waving my hand in his general direction. No, he said, that question fell somewhere in the space between us. It never reached me. Ask it again, only this time with oomph. And he added, if you don't got oomph, you don't got it. So I had another go. David also said, once I could deliver a question with oomph, I needed to pay attention to where my question landed in the client's perceptual space. To do this, I needed to know where the client perceived their symbols to be in their space and to deliver my question to that particular space. Again, practice was needed. And when I finally got it, it was like I was an archer that could fire an arrow and hit the bullseye. This taught me that my attention needed to be over there in the client's metaphor landscape. Learning to deliver questions like this transformed the effectiveness of every future clean language question I ever asked. So, instead of thinking, what question should I ask next? We first wonder what and where in the metaphor landscape would it be useful for the client to attend to? Once we know that, choosing the appropriate clean language question is easy.
